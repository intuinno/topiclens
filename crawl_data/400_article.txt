SEOUL,South Korea— For South Koreans, boxing is mainly a sport of the past, a metaphor for what the country was in the 1970s and ’80s before its economy jumped to 13th largest in the world and a generation of young people grew up with privileges their parents could only imagine. Boxing was the sport of poor people, fighting for what they believed was rightfully theirs. Now, a girl whose family fledNorth Koreais breathing just a hint of new life into the sport by winning a world championship at age 17. In a soccer-crazed country, her hardscrabble tale has generated some headlines. Her promoters, striving to fill the seats for matches, played up her story. Posters for her fights bill her as Choi Hyun-mi, the “Defector Girl Boxer.” The boxing metaphor is still apt for Ms. Choi and her family. She and her parents and an older brother fled the North for a better life only to run into prejudice. Even many South Koreans who want their nation to reunite with the North view the approximately 10,000 refugees a bit like poor relations, less skilled and less urbane than the South’s highly educated citizens. Ms. Choi’s father, who had been a successful businessman in the North, has been unable to find work, and the family has been reduced to living mainly on government handouts to the refugees. Ms. Choi hopes to supplement her family’s income with her fighting fees. Like Americans who vaulted past class bias through a life in the ring, Ms. Choi also hopes to lift her family’s stature. “My parents gave up everything in North Korea to give their children a better life in the South,” she said. “Boxing is my way to prove that my parents made the right decision.” Ms. Choi pursues that dream in a gym on the top floor of a five-story building with no elevator, in a ring with an uneven and patched canvas. Faded photos of former South Korean boxing greats line the walls. The photos, and the American hip-hop that blares from speakers, are constant reminders of how much Ms. Choi’s life has changed since her family arrived here four years ago. When she began her boxing career in North Korea, she trained daily under portraits of North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-il. Government scouts in North Korea detected Ms. Choi’s potential when she was 13. Ms. Choi, now 5 feet 7 inches, was almost a head taller than her peers in a country where many children suffer from malnourishment, and she was faster than anyone in her school in Pyongyang, the North’s capital. In 2003, she was approached by the head coach of the prestigious Kim Chul-joo Educational University in Pyongyang, who was developing a national women’s team in the hope that women’s boxing would be added as an event in the 2008 Olympics. She was the youngest of the 20 girls the government trained, encouraging them with more food and a cash allowance. (The International Olympic Committee, however, decided not to admit women’s boxing as an Olympic sport.) In 2004, her father, Choi Chul-soo, decided that the family should flee the North’s rampant repression and poverty. He had gotten a taste of the freedoms other countries offered while on business trips abroad. It was not an easy choice. The family had lived a life of relative comfort. He traveled overseas for his state-owned company, which exported zinc to China and sea urchins to Japan. The family’s apartment was stocked with Japanese appliances. “I dressed my children in nothing but Japanese clothes,” Mr. Choi said. “But in North Korea, even if you were rich, you were always under surveillance. People disappeared.” He was still worried enough about North Korea when he first arrived that he changed his given name to the one he has now, hoping the North’s government would take longer to identify him and possibly punish his relatives who remained behind. The family escaped when Mr. Choi was on a business trip in China. He sent for his family and bribed border guards to ensure a safe crossing. From China, the family was smuggled into Vietnam. After four months there hiding in hotel rooms, the family was granted asylum by the South Korean government and flown to Seoul. But once here, Mr. Choi’s fears were realized. Without work, he could no longer afford luxuries for his family, which lives in a rented apartment that is half the size of its apartment in Pyongyang. “I sometimes miss my life in North Korea and wonder whether I made the right choice,” he said. One bright spot is his daughter’s budding career. After entering amateur contests in 2006, she swept five domestic championships, suffering only one defeat in 17 fights. In September 2007, she turned professional. A little more than a year later, on Oct. 11, Ms. Choi beat Xu Chun Yan of China for the World Boxing Association’s women’s featherweight championship. It was not an easy match. Ms. Choi’s more experienced opponent landed many punches. But she eventually tired, and Ms. Choi used her straight punches to dominate the later rounds. Her coach, Kim Han-sang, said Ms. Choi’s height gave her an advantage. The win made her one of five South Korean women to hold a boxing championship title. “When I returned to my corner between rounds of my championship bout, I glimpsed down at my mother sobbing,” Ms. Choi said. It was clear to Ms. Choi that she was not only helping shoulder the family’s hopes, but that she might even be able to raise its income a bit with her cut of the $7,000 she makes per fight. On a recent day, she returned to the gym after taking a week off to recuperate from her championship bout. She wore oversize sunglasses on the street to hide her black eyes and swollen face. Her arms still bore bruises. She said she boxed for her family, for fame and for her figure. “Boxing makes you curvy,” she said, striking a pose with a giggle. “I want to be a pretty girl who does pretty boxing.” She added: “But in this sport, you do take some punches.” She is about to resume her daily training routine, which includes three sessions a day, in order to prepare to defend her title in December. Her school allows her time off to train. She must lose 10 pounds to weigh in at 126 pounds or under for her featherweight class. Her coach says she needs to develop a knockout punch. But he has faith. He says that, unlike other female boxers, she is at least as concerned with being a good fighter as with staying in shape. Ms. Choi says she wants to sweep all the world titles in her weight division and then break into the country’s entertainment industry, where a few former athletes have found success. Raising her gloved hand into the air, she said, “I’m going to make everyone recognize my name.”

SHANGHAI — A senior Chinese official met on Thursday withKim Jong-il, the North Korean leader, and came to some consensus about the crisis on the Korean Peninsula, according to Xinhua, China’s official news agency. China gave few details about the meeting or the consensus but said that Dai Bingguo, one of the nation’s top diplomats, had candid talks withNorth Korea’s leader in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang. The visit came after Washington asked China to exert pressure on North Korea following the North’s military attack last month on a South Korean island. Speaking to reporters in Tokyo on Thursday, the top American military officer, Adm. Mike Mullen, reiterated the stance of the United States, saying China must do more to push North Korea away from escalating threats of war. But a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Jiang Yu,  rebuked Admiral Mullen’s comments. “I want to ask those people who bring accusations against China what they have done to contribute to the regional peace,” Ms. Jiang said. “Military threats won’t solve the problem, but to increase tension.” On Monday, President Obama spoke with President Hu Jintao of China by telephone about the growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula. South Korean officials have vowed to retaliate against the North after its Nov. 23 artillery barrage on Yeonpyeong Island killed two South Korean marines and two civilians. United States officials have said they would step up joint military exercises with South Korea in the region. Beijing has appeared reluctant to press North Korea on the issue and has even criticized the United States for its joint military exercises in the region. China has called for arestart of the so-called six-party talksaimed at dismantling North Korea’s nuclear programs. On Wednesday, Admiral Mullencriticized Chinafor failing to intervene diplomatically with North Korea. “China has enormous influence over the North, and therefore they have a unique responsibility,” Admiral Mullen told reporters in Seoul. “Now is the time for Beijing to step up to that responsibility and guide the North, and indeed the whole region, to a better future.” Admiral Mullen’s comments came during a trip to South Korea and Japan, part of aneffort by the United Statesto encourage Beijing to use its regional influence to prevent further episodes like the Nov. 23 artillery barrage. A high-level delegation from the State Department will travel to the region next week.

A science university founded by American evangelical scholars began its first day of classes in Pyongyang, the capital of the secretive Communist state.

SEOUL, South Korea — Of all the fantastic tales to come out ofNorth Korea— the country’s leader is injected with the blood of virgin girls, he made 11 holes-in-one during his very first round of golf, each grain of rice he eats is inspected by hand for imperfections, his youngest son and would-be successor has had cosmetic surgery to make him resemble his grandfather — not one of these seems as improbable as the event that took place on Monday, when a science university founded by American evangelical scholars began its first day of classes in Pyongyang, the capital of the secretive Communist state. North Korea, the nuclear-armed “hermit kingdom,” is so poor that there is almost no supply of concrete, bricks or window glass. People suffer shortages of rice, gasoline and even underwear. The Internet barely exists, not to mention computers, and the economy is so moribund that most factories barely function for lack of raw materials and electricity. In spite of all this, classes in technical English started Monday at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology. A fuller curriculum in information technology, business management and agriculture is supposed to get under way in March. “It’s amazing, and kind of a miracle,” said Park Chan-mo, one of the founders of the school, which was largely financed by contributions from evangelical Christian groups in the United States and South Korea. “Many people were skeptical, but we’re all Christians. We had faith.” The driving force behind the school was Kim Chin-kyung, an American born in Seoul who founded a university in China in 1992. He made periodic trips from China into North Korea and in 1998 was arrested at his hotel in the capital and thrown into prison, accused of being an agent for the C.I.A. The relentlessinterrogationswent on for six weeks and almost broke him. “I was ready to die,” he said in a 2001 interview, even writing out a will and bequeathing his organs for transplants and medical study in Pyongyang. He was finally released, he said, after convincing the authorities that “I was not the kind of person who would spy on them.” In November 2000, a man appeared in his university office in China — oddly, the same man who had ordered his arrest for espionage in Pyongyang in 1998. But this time he had a proposal from the North Korean government: could he duplicate his Chinese technical university in Pyongyang? “Doing business with North Korea is not for the faint of heart,” Mr. Kim said on the school’s Web site, “but the effort is ennobling and necessary.” The first group of 160 undergraduate and master’s students has been chosen by the North Korean government, selected from its top colleges and from the political and military elite. Their tuition, room, board and books are all free, financed by foreign donors and individual sponsors. The plans call for an eventual student body of 2,600 and a faculty of 250, with classes in public health, architecture, engineering and construction. Sixteen professors from the United States and Europe arrived in Pyongyang over the weekend. For now, no South Korean professors are allowed because of recent political tensions between the Koreas. It seems an unlikely marriage — the hard-line Communist state and wealthy Christian capitalists — and it remains to be seen how well the match has been made. North Korea, while reluctant to expose its citizens to the outside world, has been seeking foreign investment for its decrepit educational system. For their part, the evangelicals, who have antagonized the North by encouraging defections and assisting refugees after they cross over, are seeking a foothold inside the churchless state. North Korea has made a similar bargain before. The Unification Church of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, not only a Christian but staunchly anti-Communist, operates a car factory in Pyongyang, for instance. But the church is allowed to make only cars, not Christians or capitalist converts. There is no campus chapel at the new university, Dr. Park said, and there is not one in the plans. But neither, for now, are there any official portraits of the North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, or his father, the late Kim Il-sung, which hang in every school and public building in the North. The $35 million, 240-acre campus includes a faculty guesthouse and world-class dormitories and classrooms, all of which are said to have running water, power and heat. The school has its own backup generators, but with so little diesel and gasoline available in the North, fuel has to be trucked in from neighboring China. Classes will be taught in English, and Internet access has been promised to all students. The campus has sirens that go off before rolling electrical blackouts, so work on computers can be saved. “The Internet will be censored, and we can’t imagine that it won’t be,” said Dr. Park, who has been involved in educational exchanges with the North since 2000. “Even in South Korea things are blocked. I’m sure North Korea has been looking at my e-mails. I keep them businesslike.” Dr. Park, the former president of the prestigious Pohang University of Science and Technology in South Korea, said the university project could not have been completed without the approval of the United States government. Officials at the school, eager not to run afoul of international sanctions in place against the North, have even sent its curriculum to the State Department for vetting. One request from Washington was that the name of the biotechnology course be changed for fear that it might be seen as useful in developing biological weapons, Dr. Park said. So the course title was changed to “Agriculture and Life Sciences.” The United States government also was also “very sensitive,” Dr. Park said, about young North Korean scientists learning skills that could be used by the military or in developing nuclear weapons. “We can’t be fooled into teaching them those kinds of things.” Several conservative lawmakers from South Korea called for Seoul, which gave $1 million to the school in 2006, to cut off all support. One legislator, Yoon Sang-hyun, was angered that the North insisted that future economics classes include lessons about juche, or Kim Il-sung’s founding philosophy of self-reliance. Some critics also have suggested that there must have been heavy payoffs made to the North Korean government to move the project along, but Mr. Kim insisted that no deals had been made. “Every brick we used, every bit of steel, every bit of equipment, we brought in from China,” Mr. Kim, who was in Pyongyang for the opening, said in an interview in Fortune last year. “I have never brought any cash into North Korea.” “I have unlimited credit at the Bank of Heaven,” he added.

SEOUL, South Korea  — An American man who was arrested inNorth Koreafor illegal entry was sentenced to eight years of hard labor, the North’s state-run news agency reported on Wednesday. The American, Aijalon Mahli Gomes, a 30-year-old from Boston, was also fined 70 million North Korean won in the sentence given on Tuesday, said the Korean Central News Agency. Under the North’s official exchange rate, the fine amounts to $700,000. “The accused admitted all the facts which had been put under accusation,” the agency said. “The presence of representatives of the Swedish embassy here to witness the trial was allowed as an exception at the request of the Swedish side protecting the U.S. interests.” Mr. Gomes was convicted of illegal entry and “hostile acts” against North Korea, it said, without elaborating. Incarceration in a harsh labor camp is a common form of criminal punishment in North Korea. Washington does not have formal diplomatic ties with North Korea and has relied on Swedish diplomats in Pyongyang to again access to Mr. Gomes. Last year, North Korea arrested two American journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, and sentenced them to 12 years of hard labor for illegally entering the North. But the women were pardoned and released five months later, after former President Bill Clinton visited Pyongyang in August and met the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il. Mr. Gomes’s former colleagues and friends in South Korea say that he was a devout Christan and very likely crossed into North Korea in support of Robert Park, a Korean-American missionary who entered North Korea illegally on Dec. 25 to call for Mr. Kim, the North Korean leader, to end human rights abuses. Before his travel to North Korea, Mr. Gomes, an English teacher in South Korea, attended at least two rallies in South Korea calling for Mr. Park’s release. North Korea released Mr. Park in early February, saying that it had decided to “leniently forgive” him and that he had acknowledged his mistakes and repented. There was no immediate comment available from the United States  government on the sentencing of Mr. Gomes.

North Korea will redenominate the won currency to drop two zeros from the nominal value of bills in an effort to fight inflation and clamp down on black-market trading, South Korea’s main news agency reported. The Yonhap news agency quoted multiple North Korean foreign trading officials based in China as saying that the reform measure was implemented at 11 a.m. on Monday and made people rush to convert their won currency into yuan or United States dollars on the black markets. After the conversion, 1,000-won notes were to be exchanged for 10-won notes.

Criticism from some Republicans of the Clintons’ success in gaining the release of two American journalists from North Korea is misplaced.

Washington THE criticisms from some of my fellow Republicans of former President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s success in gaining the release of two American journalists from North Korea’s gulag are misplaced. The Clintons’ behavior demonstrated respect for the expertise of their advisers and restraint from political grandstanding. Any propaganda gain for the North Korean regime will be short-term and limited. It’s even possible that the episode will have a positive effect on our troubled nuclear negotiations. Ever since the journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, were captured on North Korea’s border with China in March, America has had little diplomatic leverage. The Obama administration had two choices: to demand their release in a loud and threatening tone, or to use wits and discipline. Some commentators are suggesting that the Clintons’ actions showed American weakness by expressing regret to a ruthless dictator. These critics need to ask themselves: how would a more aggressive approach have gained the release of these two women from a sentence of 12 years of hard labor? Previous episodes of Americans drifting into North Korea — including an American helicopter pilot captured in 1994 who was released after Bill Richardson, then a member of Congress, traveled to Pyongyang — have taught us the pattern. First, North Korea protests the violations of its territory. Then it threatens or sentences the individuals. Finally, talks between North Korean diplomats, private intermediaries and American officials come up with a way for the North to climb down while saving face. Bolstering the egos of Pyongyang’s leaders is no pleasure. Look at Bill Clinton’s grim expression in photos of him with Mr. Kim. But it is a proved means to a desired end. The public stance of the Obama administration was dignified and correct throughout. Mrs. Clinton rightly acknowledged the prevailing legal system in North Korea in making a public plea for clemency, and Bill Clinton delivered the request in person. The alternative — having administration officials rant about the many perversions of the North’s system — would not have brought the journalists home. The administration also deserves credit for insisting that these negotiations had nothing to do with efforts to penalize North Korea for its belligerence. It pressed hard for two sets of sanctions at the United Nations Security Council after North Korea’s test firing of a long-range missile in April and nuclear test in May.  Will Mr. Clinton’s visit be a turning point in relations with North Korea? That is more up to Pyongyang than Washington. Kim Jong-il, who is reported to have had a stroke last year, looks frail but he is not necessarily dying. He seems to have completed his efforts to rally military support for his plan to have his 26-year-old son succeed him. He may be ready now to turn a more cooperative face to the outside world, if only for domestic political reasons. In any new talks, of course, we can expect Pyongyang to try all sorts of diplomatic reversals to increase its leverage and gain bigger payoffs. Fortunately, the Obama administration has proved itself wary. For example, it has refused the North’s offers to resume bilateral negotiations unless Pyongyang agrees to return to the agreements reached during now-stalled six-party talks. If tensions begin to cool and North Korea shows itself more open to legitimate talks, then the Clinton diplomacy will have helped to produce unexpected dividends. For the moment, however, it is enough to have two of our citizens back from the gates of Hell with America’s dignity intact.

North Korea emphasized that it was not interested in resuming six-nation talks.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreasaid Monday it was open to new discussions to help resolve the dispute over itsnuclear weaponsprogram, although the North emphasized that it was not interested in resuming six-nation talks on the impasse. The comment from the North Korean Foreign Ministry was seen as an apparent willingness to engage the United States in bilateral talks, a longstanding North Korean preference. Over the weekend, Sin Son-ho, the top North Korean diplomat at the United Nations, said his government was “not against a dialogue” with Washington. And the ministry’s statement on Monday alluded to bilateral talks as “a specific and reserved form of dialogue that can address the current situation.” North Korea’s suggestion brightens the prospects for dialogue with the United States after months of increasing tensions set off by the launching of a long-range rocket by North Korea in April; its second nuclear test, in May; and a series of test-firings of short-range missiles. But a fundamental rift remains: The Obama administration has indicated it would be willing to engage the North in direct talks only if the North agrees to return to the six-nation talks that involve the United States, China, Japan, Russia and the two Koreas. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton reiterated over the weekend that Washington wants the North’s nuclear problem to be handled and resolved through six-party talks. On Monday, the North Korean Foreign Ministry said the multilateral talks were finished when the other five countries agreed to sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council following the May 25 nuclear test. The North said the penalties violated its “sovereignty.” Before the North Korean government reluctantly joined the six-party talks in 2003, it had maintained that the nuclear standoff was a matter solely between it and Washington — a position that a senior North Korean envoy revived during an Asian security conference in Thailand last week. North Korea said Monday that the six-nation talks aimed to “disarm and incapacitate” it. “What they want is to make us survive on bread crumbs tossed by them,” it said. “It would be foolish and absurd of them if they expect that we will join or leave a meeting at their bidding.” North Korea’s  insistence  on exclusive talks with Washington has been a recurring theme in the years-old nuclear standoff, with Washington trying to rope the North into a multilateral forum, where it would be held accountable before its old allies, China and Russia. As a way of pressing Pyongyang, Washington has been rallying international support to ensure strict implementation of sanctions against the North. South Korea submitted a compliance report to the United Nations on Monday, saying it has placed export bans on luxury goods to the North, as well as travel bans on North Korean officials blacklisted under the Security Council’s arms embargo. In Japan, prosecutors were seeking a three-year jail term for a businessman accused of illegally exporting to North Korea 4 used Mercedes-Benz cars, 34 pianos and 2 tanker trucks that could be used as missile launch pads, Reuters reported Monday, quoting Japanese news media. Last week, Italy reportedly blocked the sale of two luxury yachts to North Korea that the local police said were intended for the nation’s leader, Kim Jong-il.

Responding to Pyongyang's nuclear test with the retaliatory logic of the Cold War could put us on a slippery slope.

News of the nuclear test in North Korea on May 25 came while I was visiting the demilitarized zone on the Korean Peninsula. I had been invited to the inauguration ceremony for a peace bell on the 38th parallel  —  the truce line where the hostilities between North and South Korea ceased in 1953. At a press conference that morning and in my private discussions, the breaking news naturally topped the agenda. Listening to the South Koreans, I felt their alarm and concern for their own security, but also for the situation in North Korea. I saw deep and sincere sympathy for their compatriots on the other side of the demarcation line and their abiding hope for eventual reunification. There was no panic.  Emotions ran high, though, and everyone I talked to wondered anxiously about what would happen next. Just a few months earlier, it had seemed that events might take a different course. In Febru-ary 2007, North Korea had agreed to shut down its main nuclear reactor in Yongbyon. In June 2008, the reactor was partly deactivated, and television channels everywhere showed the implosion of its cooling tower. North Korea gave the United States and China no less than 18,000 pages of documentation on the progress of its nuclear program since 1990. U.N. inspectors were allowed access to its nuclear facilities. The prospect of a Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons appeared increasingly realistic. Then, suddenly,  came the U-turn late last year. Inspectors were denied access and the deactivation of the reactor was suspended. This spring, North Korea withdrew from six-party talks with the United States, China, Russia, Japan and South Korea. Now it has conducted its second nuclear test  —   the first was in October 2006  —  and test-fired at least six missiles in less than a week. Diplomats and experts differ in their assessments of what is behind this turnaround. Some regard North Korea’s actions as irrational; others see an attempt to pressure the international community into giving more aid; still others suggest that a succession struggle  is heating up.  In South Korea, some believe that the tougher line taken by their new president toward the North has been counterproductive. Serious thought needs to be given to all of this. In rethinking the situation, we must be very clear about the goal:  It is to find a way toward resuming the political and diplomatic dialogue, in particular the six-party talks. Calls for switching to a military track should be resisted. Such calls have already been heard in Japan, where North Korea’s nuclear test has given the proponents of remilitarization a new card to play.  A U.S. assistant secretary of defense, Wallace Gregson, has said that the United States would be ready to support Japan’s acquiring a capability for  preemptive strikes  at enemy bases. Even the main taboo of post-war Japan  —    acquiring nuclear weapons  —   may be in jeopardy. Such steps would only make the situation worse. They would push the North Koreans to even more recklessness and undermine the unanimity of the world’s reaction to the nuclear test, as seen in the strong statement made by the U.N. Security Council. The Security Council is devising more concrete actions to underline its members’ firm stance. What is the right mix of measures here? Certainly it must be made clear to the North Koreans that their behavior has consequences. But those who pin all hopes on tougher sanctions should keep two things in mind. First, the suffering people of North Korea must not be held hostage to the nuclear problem. Second, the collapse of a nuclear-weapons state could be catastrophic. We need to seek the keys to a political solution.  Much will depend on those members of the six-party talks who still have channels of communication with and leverage over North Korea. China maintains relations with the North on both governmental and party levels and provides vital economic aid. It has the right and every reason to tell Pyongyang that continuing the present course could bring a hard fall. China could also ask questions: Where is the “threat to the country’s sovereignty,” so often invoked by North Korea  to justify nuclear tests? The latest news from the region is alarming. North Korea has said it no longer considers itself bound by the armistice that ended the fighting between North and South Korea. It has launched at least six missiles since the second nuclear test. It may now be preparing to test an intercontinental missile. American and South Korean troops have been put on their highest alert in three years. Responding with the retaliatory logic of the Cold War could put us on a slippery slope, with unpredictable consequences. The art of politics is not to turn a problem into a threat and a threat into an armed conflict. This becomes  clear when one visits the region and talks to the people who are directly affected by this situation. They are right when they say  we must leave no stone unturned in seeking to resume dialogue  —    one that one day may solve this and other problems in the region.

Despite initial reports, it will be days or weeks before it can be determined if the test was successful and if it was a nuclear detonation.

WASHINGTON — Initial seismic readings from the underground blast inNorth Koreawere consistent with a relatively small nuclear test, but it will be days or weeks before the United States and international organizations can determine whether it was a nuclear detonation and how successful it might have been, experts said Monday. Scientists can judge the size of an underground nuclear blast by how violently it shakes the earth, although this method is not foolproof because conventional explosives can mimic the rumble. Experts can confirm the atomic origin by detecting the signature of radioactive gases and particles that a nuclear blast emits. The United States Geological Surveyreportedthat Monday’s episode had a magnitude of 4.7, which would make it slightly larger than the one that the North Koreans generated inOctober 2006. Many experts considered that atomic blast a near flop, and they wondered the same about Monday’s test. “Was it another fizzle?” asked Hans M. Kristensen, a nuclear expert at the Federation of American Scientists. “We’ll have to wait for more analysis of the seismic data, but so far the early news media reports about a ‘Hiroshima-size’ nuclear explosion seem to be overblown.” Annika Thunborg, a spokeswoman in Vienna for the preparatory commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization, said in an interview that 39 of the organization’s tracking stations had detected the seismic event, and that the commission had judged its magnitude to be 4.5. Martin B. Kalinowski, a nuclear expert at the University of Hamburg, said a magnitude of 4.7 corresponded to a nuclear explosive yield of about three to eight kilotons of high explosives, with the most likely yield being four kilotons. A blast that generated a tremor with a magnitude of 4.5 would be smaller. In contrast, the primitive bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki had explosive yields of 15 kilotons and 22 kilotons, respectively. A senior Obama administration official said Monday afternoon that based on seismic data alone, officials estimated the explosion at “several kilotons.” That would be a major advance beyond the 2006 test. However, senior American officials still had not seen any results of environmental sampling that might reveal details of the blast and confirm that it was nuclear. While seismic readings are taken immediately by systems in the region and around the globe, the specialized devices that can measure spikes in radiation in the air and water must await any seepage from the underground North Korean test site to be carried by the wind and sea currents to fixed sensors. Aircraft with high-technology “sniffer” devices read radiation increases carried by the wind, but American military officers cautioned that weather conditions dictate how quickly those aircraft can be launched into international airspace off North Korea. Once all of the evidence is gathered it takes time to analyze it, at laboratories in Vienna, where many of the United Nations’ monitoring organizations are, and in the United States. “We know there was a seismic event of about 4.7, which comports with a nuclear test as the North Koreans have claimed — and with what we had been anticipating them to do,” a senior military officer said. “So it fits with their rhetoric and our expectations. But for any detailed assessment beyond that, we’ll have to wait a few days for the tests and analysis.” That officer, like other military and Pentagon civilian officials who agreed to discuss initial reports on the seismic event, did so on the condition of anonymity since much of the information remains classified. In a statement on Monday, the test-ban commission said the radiological detection should be quicker this time around because more stations have been activated since 2006. “The meteorological situation,” the statement said, “will determine how long it will take” to identify the radioactive gases.

Many Western analysts greetedNorth Korea’s failure to put a satellite into orbit early this month with scorn, with one joke complimenting the dictator for a successful launch into the deep sea. “Pacific plankton will forever live in fear of the mighty reach ofKim Jong Il,”one analyst wrote, “now that millions have perished in one mighty splash.” But not everyone is laughing. Others have portrayed the rocket launching not as an embarrassing flop but a technical success that threatens the West with atomic ruin. “This is a very serious development,” Frank J. Gaffney Jr., a former Pentagon official who directs the Center for Security Policy, a private group in Washington,said of the Korean launchingon the MSNBC talk show “Hardball.” Eerily, such upbeat assessments sounded much like those of Pyongyang, which boasted that the satellite was up there after all, broadcasting patriotic tunes from outer space. What gives? Nothing unusual in the strange world of defense lobbying, where threat inflation anddeflationcan portray the same potential enemy as a dwarf one minute, a towering giant the next. In this case, the hidden agendas centered on the Pentagon’s antimissile program, which has consumed some $100 billion in the last decade and still costs about $10 billion a year. Analysts pooh-poohing the North Korean launch want that money for arms control, while the ringers of alarm bells want to save the program from administration budget cutters. “The advocates want to scare people, so they hype the threat,” said Philip E. Coyle III, a former director of weapon testing at the Pentagon and a senior adviser to the Center for Defense Information, a private group in Washington, D.C. They see stark portrayals of Korean danger, Dr. Coyle added, “as an opportunity to promote missile defense.” Such portrayals take bravado, since the failed launching was North Korea’s third unsuccessful bid to loft a satellite in a decade, the splashdown made all the more humiliating by Pyongyang’s weeks of drumrolls and world defiance. Still, antimissile backers rose to the occasion. “North Korea has successfully tested a long-range ballistic missile,” Riki Ellison, president of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance,commented  in a news release. “This success coupled with the North Koreannuclear weaponsmakes North Korea a nuclear threat.” Mr. Ellison, a former linebacker for the San Francisco 49ers, makes no apologies for his group’s advocacy. Located in Old Town Alexandria, Va., just down the road from the Pentagon, the alliance has on its advisory board three former directors of the Pentagon’s antimissile program, as well as a number of other military heavyweights. Mr. Gaffney, a pioneer of antimissile advocacy, is a conservative celebrity. An architect of President Ronald Reagan’s Star Wars program, he left the Pentagon in 1987 and then set up the Center for Security Policy, which prides itself on antimissile education. The technical products upon which these men lavish such hopes and praise already sprawl across the wilds of Alaska and a sister base in California. There, in the last five years, military contractors have installed two dozen interceptor rockets meant to shoot down North Korean warheads. But test flights of the interceptors have repeatedly fallen short, and critics call the supposed protection a mirage. “The U.S. track record for the successful interception of ballistic missiles is not much better than North Korea’s track record for launching ballistic missiles,”said Tim Brown, a senior fellow atGlobalSecurity.org, a private group in Alexandria, Va. Even so, Mr. Gaffney hails the weapons as potential saviors. After telling “Hardball” that a North Korean nuclear attack could turn the United States “into a preindustrial society,” he lauded the arsenal of interceptors. “Thank God we’ve got a missile defense,” he said. Antimissile foes take the other tack, demeaning the Korean threat. Joseph Cirincione, president of the Ploughshares Fund, a private group that seeks to curb the spread of nuclear arms, dismissed the Korean test flight as not only a failure but intrinsically nonthreatening. To become a military danger anytime soon,he told CNN, North Korea would need to make bigger missiles, and warheads that are more compact to put atop them. “North Korea simply does not have the technical background or institutional capacity,” he argued. “It is time to put aside the hype.” Engineers tend to inhabit the middle ground, saying that failures teach more than successes and that the North Koreans are slowly — albeit very slowly — learning rocketry. David C. Wright, a senior scientist at theUnion of Concerned Scientists, a private group in Cambridge, Mass., noted that the recent Korean test was less of a failure than the nation’s 2006 attempt, and that the flop might provide useful information about how to make improvements. The scary warnings over the Korean test seem to have had little impact on Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates. On April 6, the Monday  after the launching,he proposed$1.4 billion in budget cuts for the Pentagon’s antimissile program in the coming fiscal year — a reduction of about 15 percent. Mr. Gates said he would recommend against a planned increase in the number of interceptors in Alaska, and would scrap efforts to develop an advanced interceptor warhead. But he also sought the middle ground. In a nod to emerging dangers, as well as his political constituencies, Mr. Gates said the department planned to keep financing research meant to improve existing defenses against rogue states — a threat, he added, that “North Korea’s missile launch this past weekend reminds us is real.”

Two journalists will face charges of perpetrating “hostile acts” against the Communist state, North Korea’s state-run news agency reported.

SEOUL — Two American journalists detained inNorth Koreawill be indicted and tried on charges of perpetrating "hostile acts" against the Communist state, a crime punishable by years in a labor camp, the North’s state-run news agency reported on Tuesday. Pyongyang’s decision to put Laura Ling and Euna Lee on trial signaled that the regime has no intention of freeing them soon. Their indictment comes amid heightening tension between Pyongyang and Washington over a North Korean plan to launch a rocket by Wednesday next week. United States officials consider a possible rocket launch a provocative test of the North’s long-range missile technology. Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee, reporters for Current TV, a San Francisco-based media venture founded by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, were arrested by the North Korean military on March 17 on charges of illegally crossing the border from China. They were in China to report the plight of North Korean refugees who fled hunger at home and were living in hiding there. The North’s state-run Korean Central News Agency accused the two of “illegal entry"  and said, "their suspected hostile acts have been confirmed by evidence and their statements, according to the results of intermediary investigation conducted by a competent organ.” "The organ is carrying on its investigation and, at the same time, making a preparation for indicting them at a trial on the basis of the already confirmed suspicions," it said. This was the first reported case in which a U.S. citizen will be indicted and tried in North Korea, South Korean officials said. The North’s criminal code calls for between 5 and 10 years of "education through labor" for people convicted of "hostile acts" against the state. In a "severe" case, the code allows more than 10 years in labor camp. Fred Lash, a U.S. State Department spokesman, said the U.S. government has seen the report and was working diplomatically to "achieve a favorable outcome," Reuters reported. Washington has no diplomatic ties with Pyongyang, but a Swedish diplomat based in Pyongyang met the journalists on Washington’s behalf. On Tuesday, North Korea said it would allow the reporters consular access and treated them according to international laws. When Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee were arrested on the border between China and North Korea under the still-unclear circumstances, they became unwitting pawns  in the delicate international politics surrounding the North’s planned rocket launch, said a senior South Korean official. On Monday, North Korea detained a South Korean worker in a joint industrial complex in the North on charges of inciting North Korean workers to defect to the South. South Korean officials were struggling to get access to the detained worker on Tuesday. With a three-stage rocket placed at a launch pad on the North’s northeast coast, Washington warned that there will be "consequences" if North Korea presses ahead with the launch. Pyongyang has said that if Washington tries to punish it for what it calls the launching of a communications satellite, not a missile, it will quit six-nation nuclear disarmament talks and restart its plutonium-producing nuclear facilities. Washington, Japan and South Korea are concerned about a North Korean missile launch, fearing the North is trying to miniaturize itsnuclear weaponsso that its missiles can carry them as warheads. They also accuse North Korea of exporting missile technology to countries in the Middle East.

The documents, which officials have described as representing a complete accounting of North Korea’s plutonium production, were briefly displayed to the media on Tuesday.

WASHINGTON — The State Department, seeking to ward off criticism, kicked off a public-relations offensive on Tuesday by offering reporters a view — from a distance — of nuclear documents that senior officials said appeared to represent a complete accounting ofNorth Korea’s plutonium production. Officials brought documents received last week into a briefing room and put them on a table where they could be photographed, but not touched, which might have been tantalizing were it not for the fact that the reports had not been translated. The 18,000 pages, turned over by North Korea last week, were hailed as a vital step toward the completion of a denuclearization agreement. The administration wants to complete the pact, which could be viewed as a rare foreign policy victory, before President Bush leaves office. Conservatives have complained that the United States is not getting enough out of North Korea as the two sides try to complete the agreement. Sung Kim, the director of the State Department’s Korea office, said  North Korea may have slowed down the pace of its compliance with one part of the deal, which requires the dismantlement of a nuclear reactor at Yongbyon. “We’d like to see it sped up,” Mr. Kim said. North Korean officials have indicated that they want to make sure that the United States delivers the fuel oil it has promised to the North before the dismantlement is completed. Mr. Kim, who was in North Korea last week, said his North Korean counterparts had also reiterated their desire to be removed from the list of state sponsors of terrorism, a step the Bush administration has promised if the nuclear deal is completed. But the documents provided by North Korea do not include any information about two other topics on which it promised to be forthcoming: a uranium program that some officials in the Bush administration regard as another track toward weapons development and North Korea’s involvement in the proliferation of nuclear material. The nuclear pact requires North Korea to disclose all of its nuclear activities, but it remains unclear whether the administration will get much explicit disclosure on uranium and proliferation. The House on Tuesday debated a bill that is intended to force the administration to hold North Korea to a more stringent standard, requiring it to show that it has stopped providing nuclear assistance to other countries before it is removed from the list. The White House opposes the bill and administration officials have indicated that the United States might try to finesse the issues, by getting North Korea to acknowledge American concerns without admitting anything.  The United States would then try to verify that North Korea had stopped its weapons program by sending inspectors to all of North Korea’s nuclear facilities, administration officials said. Mr. Kim said it would take weeks to go through the seven boxes of documents, which relate to North Korea’s plutonium program and go back to 1987. They contain information about North Korea’s three major campaigns to reprocess plutonium for nuclear weapons, administration officials say. Also on Tuesday, the White House spokeswoman, Dana Perino, said the United States was looking for ways to get 500,000 tons offood aidto North Korea, perhaps through nongovernmental organizations or the United Nations. Ms. Perino said that such a step would not be linked to the nuclear pact.

President Bush and South Korea’s new president, Lee Myung-bak, said that there was a chance for progress on eliminating North Korea’s nuclear arms program.

CAMP DAVID, Md. — President Bush on Saturday dismissed assertions that his administration had softened demands thatNorth Koreafully declare all of its nuclear activities, including secret efforts to enrich uranium and sell nuclear technology abroad. Appearing here at the presidential retreat with South Korea’s new president,Lee Myung-bak, Mr. Bush said that any judgment about North Korea’s willingness to dismantle its nuclear program — the core of an agreement negotiated last year — would only come once North Korea completed a declaration of its nuclear activities. The deadline for that declaration passed at the end of last year, and no new deadline has been set. That has left the agreement signed 14 months ago by North and South Korea, the United States, China, Japan and Russia increasingly in doubt. Mr. Bush, facing criticism from some conservatives, distanced himself from statements by administration officials that the United States and other countries were prepared to accept something less than a full admission about North Korea’s secret nuclear programs. “Look, we’re going to make a judgment as to whether North Korea has met its obligations to account for its nuclear program and activities, as well as meet its obligations to disable its reactor,” Mr. Bush said, referring to North Korea’s known plutonium reactor in Yongbyon. “In other words, we’ll see. The burden of proof is theirs.” In recent weeks, American and Asian officials have said that the United States was prepared to postpone a demand that North Korea account for a fledging uranium program operated in addition to the plutonium enrichment it has acknowledged and has begun to dismantle. The officials said the United States would also relax a demand that North Korea admit that it supplied technology to Syria, including components for a nuclear reactor that Israeli jets destroyed last September. The senior director for Asian Affairs on the National Security Council, Dennis Wilder, said on Thursday that the declarations regarding proliferation and uranium would be negotiated separately with the United States and would not be part of the main declaration called for in last year’s agreement. Mr. Lee, a conservative who was elected in December, echoed Mr. Bush’s position. He insisted that “under no circumstances” would North Korea be allowed to retain possession of nuclear weapons. He also urged patience, though, saying that a negotiated settlement remained the best option to dismantle the North Korean nuclear arsenal. North Korea tested a nuclear bomb in 2006 and is estimated to have enough material to assemble several more weapons. Neither Mr. Lee nor Mr. Bush indicated how long they would be willing to give North Korea to make its declaration. “It’s difficult to convince North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons,” Mr. Lee said, speaking through a translator, “but it is not impossible.”

SEOUL, South Korea — The United States urgedNorth Koreaon Thursday to rethink its position and give a “complete and correct” accounting of its nuclear weapons programs before a new conservative South Korean president takes office in late February, perhaps with more sticks than carrots for the North. “I really think it has to do with transparency,” Christopher R. Hill, Washington’s main nuclear envoy, said in South Korea. “We can’t have a situation where we pretend programs didn’t exist when we both know that they existed,” he added. North Korea missed a Dec. 31 deadline for disabling its main nuclear complex at Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang, and, according to Washington, for providing a full list of its nuclear activities, including weapons, facilities and fissile material. Last week, North Korea announced that there was nothing further to declare because it had already explained enough. The North’s position created uncertainty about the Bush administration’s efforts to get North Korea to abandon all its nuclear assets. On Thursday, Mr. Hill said Washington was willing to give North Korea more time to provide a fuller accounting of whether it has a uranium enrichment program and of what it has produced with its acknowledged plutonium program. He played down the latest setback, saying that in the United States’ dealings with North Korea, missed deadlines are not rare. “Obviously, we had a bit of a bump in the road over the declaration, but I think everyone agrees that we need a declaration that’s complete and correct,” Mr. Hill said. “That’s more important in fact than a timely declaration.” He said it would be “very desirable” if North Korea finished disabling the Yongbyon facilities and declared its nuclear programs before the government of President-elect Lee Myung-bak of South Korea was sworn in on Feb. 25. Mr. Hill made his comments after meeting Mr. Lee in Seoul. Mr. Lee favors engaging North Korea, but, unlike the departing president, Roh Moo-hyun, he emphasizes that North Korea should cooperate in efforts to end its nuclear weapons program before getting meaningful aid from South Korea and economic exchanges with it. After a series of talks with the United States and other regional powers, North Korea agreed last year to the nuclear disablement and declaration, in return for one million tons of fuel. It did shut down the Yongbyon complex, where work to disable it has continued past the Dec. 31 deadline. The United States hopes to get North Korea to move beyond the disablement and to dismantle all its nuclear facilities by the end of this year, although there is doubt that North Korea will ever give up its nuclear weapons.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 5 (AP) — The State Department said Monday that a team of American experts had arrived atNorth Korea’s sole functioning nuclear reactor and begun the work of disabling the facilities. A State Department spokesman, Tom Casey, told reporters that the disabling of the nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, north of the capital, Pyongyang, “is a positive first step in this process, and we certainly hope to see it continue.” He had no details about what specific steps the team was taking. North Korea shut down Yongbyon in July and promised to disable it by year’s end in exchange for energy aid after talks with the United States, China, Japan, South Korea and Russia. The North conducted its first nuclear test in October 2006.

The North Korean claim, which was synchronized with the arrival of a shipment of fuel oil from South Korea, marked the first step toward reversing a confrontation with the U.S.

==::==
North Koreatold the United States today that it has shut down the nuclear reactor and readmitted a permanent international inspection team, completing its first step toward reversing a four-year-long confrontation with the United States during which the country appears to have built a small arsenal of nuclear weapons. The North sent a message that the reactor at Yongbyon had been shut down through the country’s small mission to theUnited Nationsat 9:30 this morning, according to Christopher Hill, the assistant secretary of state who negotiated the accord in February after gradually getting the Bush administration to reverse many of the decisions it made in the first term about how to deal with the reclusive state. The North Korean claim, which was carefully synchronized with the arrival of a first shipment of fuel oil from South Korea, can be easily verified by the 10-member inspection team from theInternational Atomic Energy Agency. They arrived at the bleak, heavily guarded nuclear site roughly 60 miles north of Pyongyang today, to begin supervising what is envisioned as a lengthy disarmament plan. American spy satellites will also be able to detect whether the reactor core is cooling, though that confirmation could take several days. But Mr. Hill has said that it could be the end of the year before North Korea, in return for large shipments of additional fuel oil, completes the next critical steps required under the accord: Permanently disabling the reactor so that it can no longer produce plutonium for nuclear weapons, and issuing a complete declaration of all of its nuclear assets — including how many weapons it may have produced since it threw out inspectors just before New Years Day in 2003. “Declaration is one of the early next steps,” Mr. Hill said in Tokyo before the notification of the shutdown. “We would expect a comprehensive list, declaration, to be in a matter of several weeks, possibly a couple of months. We see it as coming before disabling of the facilities,” he said. He cautioned that the shutdown was “just the first step.” It may also be the easiest. Far more difficult, according to experts and former negotiators with North Korea, will be convincing the country to disgorge what the C.I.A. estimates is enough plutonium fuel for eight or more weapons. Almost all of that was produced starting in 2003, while the United States was distracted by the invasion of Iraq and its aftermath. The accord signed in February commits the country to eventually ridding itself of that fuel or the weapons it may have been turned into. But it sets no deadlines, and getting the North to take those steps would require a second negotiation. “I could imagined that the next steps could extend beyond this administration,” William Perry, the former defense secretary under President Bill Clinton, who conducted negotiations with North Korea all through the late 1990s, said in an interview in his office at Stanford University on Friday. “And the North Koreans will demand a pretty high price for that.” Still, for President Bush the announcement today constitutes a rare diplomatic victory for an administration besieged on many fronts. In recent weeks the rising  demands from Congress for a date to begin the withdrawal from Iraq, the struggle to keep Al Qaeda and the Taliban from expanding new footholds in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and a rapidly expanding nuclear challenge from Iran has created a sense in Washington and around the world that Mr. Bush is badly weakened, and could spend the last 18 months of his presidency attempting to undo steps taken in the first six and a half years. But the shutdown of the reactor and readmitting inspectors gives him an opportunity to argue that a five-year-long strategy of negotiating alongside North Korea’s neighbors — China, Japan, South Korea and Russia — is finally bearing fruit. Mr. Bush’s innovation in dealing with the North Koreans has been an insistence that all of those countries must be party to any deal. That approach appears to have been vindicated, though in the end the administration had to drop its insistence that North Korea would not be rewarded from reversing the steps it took in 2003, when it threw out the inspectors, cranked up the production of bomb material, and withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. To lure Kim Jong Il, the North’s reclusive leader, to return to the status quo of 2002, Mr. Hill and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had to route around Vice President Cheney to strike a deal that called for the North to receive large shipments of oil as it took these first steps. They returned $25 million in cash that the administration had claimed was the ill-gotten gains of counterfeiting and arms sales, in the end using the Federal Reserve to get the money from a bank in Macao into the hands of the North Korean leadership. That process took months longer than anyone expected, delaying the reactor shutdown. The administration’s critics also noted that the February agreement to provide the North with oil bore a strong resemblance to the 1994 accord between the North and the Clinton administration that Ms. Rice had denounced at the beginning of the Bush administration as an ill-conceived giveaway, and that hardliners in the administration dismantled in 2003. The divisions over North Korea policy ran so deep that some members of the Bush Administration departed, partly in protest. Among them was Robert Joseph, the assistant secretary of state for arms control and disarmament, who told Ms. Rice that he believed the United States was helping prop up a regime that President Bush had termed evil, one that locks dissidents in gulags and whose people have starved.

A South Korean ship loaded with 6,200 tons of heavy fuel oil left for North Korea on Thursday under an agreement intended to end the North’s nuclear program.

==::==
SEOUL, South Korea, July 12 — A South Korean ship loaded with 6,200 tons of heavy fuel oil left forNorth Koreaon Thursday under an agreement intended to end the North’s nuclear program. The United Nations’ chief nuclear inspector said the North was expected to begin shutting down its main nuclear facilities early next week, after four and a half years of operation, during which time enough plutonium was thought to have been produced to make several atomic bombs. The ship is expected to arrive at Sonbong, a port in northeastern North Korea, on Saturday, the same day a team of inspectors from the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency is scheduled to arrive in the North to monitor and verify the shutdown. Mohamed ElBaradei, the director general of the atomic agency, told reporters in Seoul that shutting down five nuclear facilities in Yongbyon, 62 miles north of Pyongyang, the capital, would not be difficult and should be completed “within maybe a month or so.” His agency and North Korea have already agreed on the procedures. The shutdown would be significant because it would halt the North’s only declared program for producing fuel that can be used in nuclear weapons. The five facilities to be frozen in Yongbyon, including the country’s sole operating nuclear reactor and a radiochemical laboratory, can yield more than 13 pounds of plutonium a year, enough for one atomic bomb, according to experts. But the steps to be taken after the initial freeze of the nuclear program remain “very much open questions,” Dr. ElBaradei said. Those include whether North Korea will provide the agency with a complete inventory of its nuclear materials, and when it might return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. “It’s going to be a very long process,” he said. “It’s going to be a complicated process. How smoothly the rest of the operation will go very much depends on how progress will be made in six-party talks.” Chief envoys to the six-nation nuclear talks will meet in Beijing next Wednesday and Thursday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said. The envoys, gathering for the first talks since March, were expected to discuss moves beyond the reactor shutdown. North Korea agreed to shut down its Yongbyon facilities in a February agreement with the United States, South Korea, China, Russia and Japan. The deal called for shipping 50,000 tons of fuel oil to North Korea, and South Korea volunteered. It plans to complete shipping the oil by early August, starting with the installment on Thursday. North Korea indicated last week that it would undertake the long-delayed shutdown after the first shipment arrived. When United Nations inspectors return to Yongbyon, they will face the same problems they had faced there before they were expelled in late 2002. They will put in seals, install cameras and leave monitors to ensure that the facilities remain shut. But they will not be allowed to collect samples or access North Korean data, much less travel around the country, to determine how much nuclear material North Korea has produced in Yongbyon or elsewhere. The five-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon began operating in the mid-1980s. When suspicions about North Korea’s nuclear activities emerged in the early 1990s, a key dispute was how much plutonium had been produced at Yongbyon until then — 90 grams, about 3 ounces, as North Korea reported to the I.A.E.A., or up to 10 kilograms, about 22 pounds, as the agency suspected. The dispute has never been resolved, although North Korea agreed to suspend operations at Yongbyon in an agreement with the United States in 1994. The accord collapsed in late 2002, when North Korea expelled the United Nations inspectors and restarted the Yongbyon operation. North Korea has since claimed to have taken spent fuel unloaded from the reactor and reprocessed it into plutonium. Last October, it conducted its first nuclear test. “It remains an unanswered question: how much plutonium has North Korea so far produced?” said Lee Un-chul, a nuclear scientist at Seoul National University. “North Korea won’t easily give up its operational data.”

Talks meant to carry out a deal that calls on the North to shut its main nuclear reactor have stalled over a delay in transferring frozen funds.

BEIJING, Thursday, March 22 (Reuters) — Talks onNorth Korea’s nuclear program stalled here on Wednesday over the delayed transfer of frozen funds to the country, pushing the negotiations into an unscheduled fourth day as envoys sought a way to move forward. The talks, which began Monday, are meant to carry out a Feb. 13 deal that calls on the North to shut its main nuclear reactor and accept other disarmament steps in 60 days in return for economic aid and security assurances. But the country has insisted that it first receive $25 million that had been frozen in Banco Delta Asia in Macau. The money is to be transferred to a North Korean account at the Bank of China. Some delegates said the delay was on the Chinese end, while others said there were holdups in Macao. “As far as I know, the Bank of China refuses to accept the transfer of the frozen funds,” the Xinhua news agency quoted Aleksandr Losyukov, a Russian envoy, as saying. A Japanese delegate said there had been a “technical problem” with the transfer, and one diplomat said there had been trouble getting all the account holders to fill out forms and sign releases. The American envoy, Christopher R. Hill, told reporters there had been a “real opportunity cost” to the delay. “The Chinese asked us to stay another day,” he said. “They feel they can resolve some of these issues of the bank account that were holding things up.” The Chinese Foreign Ministry confirmed that talks had been extended into Thursday. Some envoys expressed irritation with the delays. “What’s happened is utterly absurd and outrageous that nobody anticipated,” Chun Yung-woo, of South Korea, told reporters. North Korea boycotted six-party talks for more than a year over the freezing of the Macao accounts, which came after the Bush administration accused the bank of harboring the North’s illicit earnings. The North returned to the table last December, two months after conducting its first nuclear test.

The United States said that North Korea must fully disclose its efforts to produce highly enriched uranium as part of the negotiations now under way.

The United States said yesterday thatNorth Koreamust fully disclose its efforts to produce highly enriched uranium as part of the negotiations now under way that are aimed at ending North Korea’s nuclear weapons program and normalizing relations between the two countries. “They need to come clean on it, explain what they have been doing, why they have been doing it, and ultimately they would need to abandon it,” said Christopher R. Hill, the chief United States negotiator. Mr. Hill made the remarks to a morning gathering at the Japan Society in New York prior to entering his second day of talks with Kim Kye-gwan, his North Korean counterpart. In a late afternoon briefing after the talks concluded, Mr. Hill said they had been “very good, very businesslike, very comprehensive.” The talks are the first product of a Feb. 13 agreement reached in Beijing in which  the government of Kim Jong-il said it would stop, seal and ultimately disable its nuclear facilities  in exchange for fuel and other assistance. While the accord specified that North Korea was required to make a full “declaration” of all of its nuclear activities,  the question of the uranium enrichment program in particular arose yesterday because of recent suggestions that the Bush administration may have overstated the reliability of intelligence on the progress that North Korea might have made in enriching uranium. Last October, North Korea tested its first nuclear device, a weapon made with plutonium. The United States says it believes that North Korea has also been working to develop a device using highly enriched uranium, and it points to the purchase of expensive equipment designed for that purpose that North Korea has made from Pakistan. But recently, government officials said they were no longer as confident  that the North built on that purchase and had a uranium program. Despite the recent doubts about the progress of the program, Mr. Hill said the United States was “owed a pretty clear answer” on why the purchase from Pakistan were made. “It is not unusual for a country going nuclear to go nuclear on two tracks.” The Feb. 13 accord has come under criticism from American conservatives like John R. Bolton, a former United Nations ambassador, who argue that it rewards North Korea by promising the delivery of fuel and assistance before the country’s nuclear capacity is dismantled. In defending the agreement, Mr. Hill noted that it had been criticized from both the right and the left in the United States for the same reason — that it was no improvement over a 1994 accord known as the Agreed Framework, which was struck by President Clinton, broken by North Korea and later dismissed by President Bush as a mistake. But Mr. Hill said the new agreement was not just a bilateral accord but one that was endorsed by China and other major countries in Asia. He also noted that it set up working groups with strict deadlines that are to take up issues that go beyond energy. The working groups, which are meeting in New York and in Beijing this month, will also explore  economic assistance for North Korea and a security agreement to cover all of Northeast Asia, Mr. Hill said. The Feb. 13 accord specifies a 60-day deadline for shutting down Yongbyon, North Korea’s main nuclear complex north of the capital, Pyongyang, and allowing inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, back into the country. Steps to be taken after the 60 days focus on the challenge of getting North Korea to agree to disabling nuclear facilities and verifying the amount of plutonium remaining in the country. “We want to make sure that when the North Koreans give us a declaration, there are no surprises and no omissions,” he said. A meeting was set for March 19 of the six parties that participated in hammering out the recent agreement — North and South Korea, Japan, China, Russia and the United States  — to review progress. A mid-April gathering of the countries’ foreign ministers will assess progress after 60 days. Mr. Hill said that in a visit to Washington last week he met with Republican and Democratic senators about the agreement and had received “a great deal of support, enormous support.” But he added, “If we start missing deadlines and things start going badly, some of that support will peel off.” Asked if he  feared that North Korea was playing for time and waiting for a more hospitable government in Washington after the next election, he said, “They understand that things aren’t going to get better in the next two years.” No administration, he said, could ignore the spread of nuclear weapons. He said he had assured North Korea that the United States was committed to negotiations that would eventually lead to diplomatic relations between the two countries. “I also reaffirmed to them the need for them to fulfill their part of the bargain, which is complete denuclearization,” he said. “To me it makes a lot of sense,” he said. “I look at the road that North Korea is on today, and I don’t see much future for it on this road.”

A meeting between American and North Korean envoys in late December would be critical in shaping the agreement reached Tuesday in Beijing.

BEIJING, Wednesday, Feb. 14 — On a Friday night in late December, the tortuous three-year diplomatic effort to endNorth Korea’s nuclear weapons program finally seemed dead. Two months earlier, North Korea had conducted its first nuclear weapons test, and five days of talks in Beijing had just ended in failure and acrimony. But that evening, the American team sent a messenger to the gated North Korean Embassy. Would the North be interested in a private, bilateral meeting outside Beijing? A few days later, the North agreed and chose a location — Berlin. The Berlin meeting in January was  critical in resuscitating the talks and in shaping the agreement reached Tuesday in Beijing, according to a senior United States official familiar with the American negotiating team. The official briefed a handful of reporters to provide an inside perspective on the events that led to the Tuesday deal. He spoke only on the condition of anonymity. In Berlin, the two envoys, Christopher R. Hill and Kim Kye-gwan, held their first private discussions outside the framework of the six-nation negotiations in Beijing. It was the sort of bilateral setting once forbidden by the Bush administration, but the two negotiators used it to hash out differences. “We basically teed up an agreement — what you saw today,” the official said. Or so they thought. Mr. Kim  raised the issue of energy assistance and North Korea’s need for heavy fuel oil. The envoys  decided that the North would receive oil shipments but quibbled over timing. Mr. Hill said oil could be shipped as long as the North Koreans agreed to close and seal their Yongbyon nuclear reactor and processing center within 45 days. Mr. Kim countered with 90 days. They settled on 60. The American official said the envoys agreed that the precise amount of oil would be left undetermined until working groups were established. The Americans left Berlin, and Mr. Hill briefed South Korea, Japan and China, the host of the nuclear talks. On Jan. 30, China announced that the talks would resume in February. “Beijing should have been a fairly straightforward exercise,” the American official said. But once the talks opened last Thursday, North Korea made clear its unhappiness with allowing the amount of oil to be determined by a working group. “The problem was the North Koreans wanted an overall number, and they wanted the overall number public,” the official said. Last Friday, Mr. Kim unleashed a tirade against the Americans on a range of issues, including the fuel oil. Reports leaked into the Asian news media that North Korea had thrown a fit. But eventually, the official said, all the issues faded away, except the oil. North Korea wanted a big payoff. Unnamed officials told the Japanese and South Korean news media that the North wanted two  million tons of fuel oil and two million kilowatts of electricity a year. In fact, the North Koreans had not been that specific, but the parties ultimately decided on one million tons of fuel oil — roughly a one-year supply for the entire country. The South Korean envoy, Chun Yung-woo, helped shaped the discussions about the amount of oil and also suggested “more oil for deeper denuclearization.” This link became essential for the Americans, who were distrustful of any deal that provided North Korea with oil without linking it to disarmament. A sequence emerged that withheld all but 50,000 tons of the oil until North Korea had disabled its nuclear arsenal, step by step. Mr. Kim often called back to Pyongyang, the capital, for instructions as North Korea continued to resist the wording of the oil provision. The American official said that at one point on Monday, Mr. Hill visited the North Koreans and mentioned a ceramic Korean cup he kept on his desk. He cited a Korean proverb about how pouring too much liquid into the cup causes it to drain out, leaving nothing. The message — do not get too greedy — was not lost on North Korea, but negotiations continued into early Tuesday morning. Finally, the six delegations — the United States, North Korea, China, Japan, Russia and South Korea — committed themselves to the agreement. A text was sent to the respective capitals. The only mystery was whether Pyongyang would sign off on the deal. Later on Tuesday, it did.

Ban Ki-moon, the new secretary general, appeared to be making efforts to head off the kind of problems his predecessor faced.
==::==
2007-01-20T00:00:00Z
==::==
UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 19 —Ban Ki-moon, the new secretary general, called Friday for outside examination of all United Nations activities after a published report that the United Nations Development Program inNorth Koreawas making unaccountable payments in hard currency to local staff members and the North Korean government. Mr. Ban sought “an urgent, systemwide and external inquiry into all activities done around the globe by the U.N. funds and programs.” His prompt action, taken after a morning meeting with the program’s associate administrator, Ad Melkert, appeared to be an effort to head off the kind of problems that his predecessor, Kofi Annan, faced after muddled United Nations responses to reports of scandals. “We are very pleased with the new team’s reaction,” said Richard A. Grenell, the spokesman for the American Mission. Mr. Ban, the former foreign minister of South Korea, began his five-year term on Jan. 1. Complaints about the United Nations activities in North Korea were raised over the past month by the United States Mission in a series of letters to directors of the program and were made public on Friday on the op-ed page of The Wall Street Journal. In the latest letter, dated Tuesday, Mark D. Wallace, the deputy United States ambassador for management, said that the United Nations Development Program’s operation had been “systematically perverted for the benefit of the Kim Jong Il regime rather than the people of North Korea.” Mr. Wallace said that the local staff of the development program was dominated by employees of the repressive government, that the United Nations had failed to conduct proper on-site audits and depended instead on “sham” ones by the North Korean government, and that all payments were made at the government’s demand in hard currency — dollars or euros — rather than the won, the national currency. “Simply put,” Mr. Wallace wrote, “in the absence of real audits and site visits, it is impossible for U.N.D.P. to verify whether or not any of the funds paid to the D.P.R.K. for supposed use in U.N.D.P. programs have actually been used for bona fide development purposes or if the D.P.R.K. has converted such funds for its own illicit purposes.” North Korea is officially called the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and sometimes referred to by its initials. Mr. Melkert, the associate administrator, said that the program had spent $2 million to $3 million  in North Korea annually in the past two years. He said it would cease making hard currency payments to the government, local vendors and individuals as of March 1 and would also start hiring local staff members in North Korea the way it does elsewhere, by its own choice and on merit. Even making payments in the won currency will not stop a flow of hard currency to the government, however, because the United Nations will have to buy the won from the central bank, he noted. “The question — and it is an entirely legitimate one — comes down to whether you want to operate as the U.N. in a country like North Korea,” Mr. Melkert said. He said that he welcomed the call for external auditing of his agency’s activities. Currently they are examined in  internal audits, which are then given to the United Nations auditing board, which decides what to transmit to the General Assembly. Asked about the American charge that funds might have been diverted to illicit ends, he said, “The audits have not given any reason for suspicion about money not being used for the purposes meant. Still, in order to make sure that there are no misperceptions or unintended consequences, we are supportive of an external independent audit.” It was not clear how quickly or effectively Mr. Ban could impose his order across the range of United Nations agencies, many of which have differing auditing procedures and over which he does not have direct budget authority. “It’s worldwide; it’s not going to be done overnight,” said Michèle Montas, his spokeswoman.

In “The Red Chapel,” a Danish journalist sets out to punk North Korea by arranging to visit it with two Danish-Korean comedians.
==::==
2010-12-29T00:00:00Z
==::==
In “The Red Chapel” a Danish journalist named Mads Brugger sets out to punk North Korea by arranging to visit  it with a bogus comedy troupe. And yes, he succeeds in getting inside that closed country, under the guise ofcultural exchange. But what he thinks he’s accomplished by doing so is never very clear, and the product — sloppy even by guerrilla filmmaking standards — has no revelations to offer that are worth the slog of watching it. Mr. Bruggertakes along two collaborators, Jacob Nossell and Simon Jul, who are Danish-Korean comedians. Mr. Nossell has a disability that, among other things, leaves his speech difficult to understand; he refers to himself as a spastic. “If the North Koreans ever were able to understand the Danish language,” Mr. Brugger says, explaining how he hopes to get the troupe’s commentary by the North Korean censors, “they would never be able to understand spastic Danish.” When the three get to North Korea, they are assigned to a handler, identified only as Mrs. Pak, who monitors their every move and, of course, lets them see only what the government wants them to see. So the film has nothing to show but pretty buildings and pretty people; Mr. Brugger is reduced to asserting, over these images, that terrible things are happening in other parts of the country. Certainly true, but we already knew that from more authoritative sources. The most compelling person in the film ends up being Mrs. Pak, who seems kindhearted and well intentioned. The question of whether a person can buy into a repressive regime and still retain her humanity hangs over this film but is left unexplored. THE RED CHAPEL Opens on Wednesday  in Manhattan. Directed by Mads Brugger,  based on his original idea; director of photography, René Johannsen; edited by Mr. Johannsen; costumes by Simon Jul; produced by Peter Engel, Zentropa RamBUk;  released by Lorber Films. At the IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at Third Street, Greenwich Village. In Danish, Korean and English, with English subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 27 minutes. This film is not rated.

The youngest son of Kim Jong-il has been promoted to military general, the clearest sign yet that he is on his way to taking power.
==::==
2010-09-28T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — The youngest son ofKim Jong-il,North Korea’s reclusive leader, has been promoted to a military general, that country’s official Korean Central News Agency reported early Tuesday, the clearest sign yet that he is in line to succeed his father as the country’s leader. A brief dispatch by KCNA said the son,Kim Jong-un, and five others had been made generals in the Korea People’s Army. It was the first time that KCNA or any North Korean news outlet had mentioned the son, who is either 27 or 28, by name. “This promotion of Kim Jong-un to four-star general carries a lot of weight in North Korea, and it has the connotation of very senior ‘top brass,’ ” said Lee Sung-yoon, a North Korea expert at the Fletcher School at Tufts University. “This is a very big deal.” The new generals’ roster also included Kim Kyong-hui, the elder Mr. Kim’s sister. She is the wife of Jang Seong-taek, often regarded by outside analysts as the No. 2 man in the North and a potential caretaker for the government should Kim Jong-il, 68, who is in failing health, suddenly become incapacitated. The news came hours after delegates to a rare gathering of the ruling Workers’ Party arrived in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, on Monday as the party began final preparations for a meeting that could provide further signals about Kim Jong-un’s debut. Photographs from Pyongyang showedbanners and posters announcing the meeting, and there has been heavy speculation in the South Korean news media aboutthe possible anointing of the younger Mr. Kim. Kurt M. Campbell, an assistant secretary of state, told reporters on Monday that the United States was “watching developments in North Korea carefully” and was talking to allies in the region “as we try to assess the meaning of what’s transpiring there.” “But frankly, it’s still too early to tell in terms of next steps, or in fact, what’s going on inside the country’s leadership,” he said. Little is known about Kim Jong-un, and most of what is has been culled from defectors and Web sites that collect information from sources in the North. In the North Korean news media he has been referred to as the “Young General,” “Youth Captain Kim” and even “C.N.C.,” short for computer numerical control, to demonstrate his bona fides as a leader for the 21st century. He is said to have attended boarding or military school in Switzerland and spent several years in the military. Korea experts had long tapped his brother, Kim Jong-nam, 39, as the most likely heir, until he tookan ill-fated trip to Tokyo Disneylandusing a fake passport. All the same, Kim Jong-un might have remained an obscure figure, but his fatherhad a strokein 2008, quickening the timetable for the succession. In a conservative Confucian society that reveres age, selling the public and, more important, the elite on a leader in his 20s is not easy. State-controlled media seem to be making a virtue of necessity, emphasizing not only Kim Jong-un’s computer expertise but also his freshness and youth, circulating songs, poems and posters singing his praises. He has latelyaccompanied his father on factory tours, and was said to have joined him on a recent trip to China. The campaign may convince some of the people, experts say, but it is likely to have little impact on the elite, who will be testing his willingness to exercise power. Some in the West, including Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates,have ascribed the sinking of a South Korean warshipby a North Korean torpedo attack in March to the succession struggle and Kim Jong-un’s efforts to establish credibility with the military brass. Others, however, contend that the elite are quite comfortable with the idea of an inexperienced leader. “I think he is chosen exactly because he is young,” Andrei Lankov, a North Korean expert at Kookmin University in Seoul, said in an interview this month. “He will be a dictator, but merely a rubber-stamping dictator. This is what the people in the positions of power want.” The party meeting was due to begin later Tuesday. Although the secretive government has said a new supreme leadership body will be elected, very little has been disclosed about the agenda.  The current gathering was originally announced by KCNA as scheduled for “early September,” and the slight delay touched off speculation about cutthroat internal wrangling over the presumed dynastic succession, Kim Jong-il’s health, and flooded roads and washed-out bridges that made travel difficult. John Delury, a professor of international relations at Yonsei University in Seoul, was in Pyongyang last week for meetings with North Korean officials and said speculation was clearly starting to build around the meeting. “This is a party meeting, and these are very rare in North Korean history,” he said in an interview on Monday. Some analysts said they believed that Kim Jong-un was almost certain to be named his father’s successor and would perhaps be given one of eight Politburo seats. Others were more cautious, suggesting his ascendancy could still be undone by political infighting. Kim Jong-il’s health has been the subject of much speculation. Some who have seen him in person say he appears wan and diminished, while others say he appears active and alert, despite a slight limp. Daniel C. Sneider, associate director for research of the Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center at Stanford, said, “At the very least, the last year tells us that Kim Jong-il knows he doesn’t have the kind of time to prepare his son for succession that he enjoyed.” At the last Workers’ Party meeting in 1980, Kim Jong-il, then 38, was named to several party posts and confirmed as the sole successor to his father. All told, he had spent more than two decades learning the ropes when he finally took control upon the death of his father, Kim Il-sung, in 1994.

Former President Jimmy Carter may have returned from Pyongyang with more than an American prisoner.
==::==
2010-09-01T00:00:00Z
==::==
Former President Jimmy Carter deserves great credit for traveling to Pyongyang and securing the release of a U.S. citizen, Aijalon Mahli Gomes, who had been sentenced to eight years in prison for illegally entering North Korea. The Obama administration had gone out of its way to assert that Mr. Carter was on this mission as a private citizen and that he carried no message from the White House. The North Koreans also made clear to Mr. Carter before his departure that he would not be able to meet the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il. In fact, Mr. Kim left for China shortly after Mr. Carter’s arrival. Still, the Carter visit may help the White House to soften the hostility of its stance toward Pyongyang, especially since the sinking of a South Korea naval ship last March. Given the difficult agenda he inherited when he came into office, President Barack Obama did not give high priority to dealing with North Korea, whose leaders were seen as obscure and irascible.  For example, a suggestion last year that the White House invite Kim Jong-un, Kim Jong-il’s youngest son and probable successor, to the United States was not seriously considered. Instead, President Obama formed a strong relationship with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, whom he saw as the dynamic leader of a strong American ally, and  was content to let Seoul set the pace in terms of dealing with Pyongyang. Mr. Lee’s policies toward North Korea were considerably tougher than those of his two predecessors, Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun, both of whom met with Kim Jong-il. Mr. Lee, by contrast, cut economic aid to the North and increased pressure for political concessions from Pyongyang. Still, a year ago, it seemed possible that relations between Seoul and Pyongyang might improve. A North Korean delegation to the August 2009 funeral of former President Kim Dae-jung, champion of the “sunshine policy” of engagement with North Korea,  was warmly received by President Lee. Later in 2009, North Korea proposed a North-South summit meeting and also  invited Kim Dae-jung’s widow to visit Pyongyang. But while these conciliatory gestures by North Korea were still under consideration, on March 26 the South Korean Navy frigate Cheonan exploded and sank under mysterious circumstances in the Yellow Sea just off the coast of the Korean Peninsula, where North and South Korean naval vessels have often clashed. A South Korean investigation concluded that the ship was sunk by a torpedo fired by a North Korean submarine. The United States concurred, and the sinking of the Cheonan came to be viewed in the United States as proof of North Korean infamy. The United States imposed additional sanctions on the North and  joined South Korea in staging military exercises of an unprecedented scope on sea and land. One of South Korea’s leading diplomats put it to me this way: “The Lee government has burned all its bridges with North Korea, and has been undertaking hard-line policies with no exit strategy. The current North-South relationship resembles a classic game of chicken.” One problem, however, is that not everybody agrees that the Cheonan was sunk by North Korea. Pyongyang has consistently denied responsibility, and both China and Russia opposed a U.N. Security Council resolution laying blame on North Korea. In June, Russia sent a team of naval experts to look over the evidence upon which the South Korea based its accusations. Though the Russian report has not been made public, detailed reports in South Korean  newspapers said  the Russians concluded that the ship’s sinking was more likely due to a mine than to a torpedo. They also concluded that the ship had run aground prior to the explosion and apparently had become entangled in a fishnet, which could have dredged up a mine that then blew the ship up. South Korea has not officially referred to the Russian conclusions. When I asked a well-placed Russian friend why the report has not been made public, he replied, “Because it would do much political damage to President Lee Myung-bak and would embarrass President Obama.” Recent statements by senior U.S. officials in Washington have continued to blame the Kims for the sinking of the Cheonan; it was purportedly done  to prove the toughness of the ruling family as it prepares for another transition. But whatever the impact of military maneuvers, economic sanctions and verbal attacks might be, those in Washington and Seoul who are hoping for a collapse of the Kim regime are doomed to disappointment. China will not let that happen. China might not be happy with a nuclear-armed North Korea, but it is far more worried by  instability on the Korean Peninsula. Putting further pressure on Pyongyang also only strengthens its dependence on China. The increasing frequency of Kim Jong-il’s trips to China, and the quality of the reception he receives, are clear indications of this trend. American pressures are also likely to instill a mistrust and hostility toward the United States in the mind of  Kim Jong-un, who is in his mid-20s and about whom little is known. The disputed interpretations of the sinking of the Cheonan remain central to any effort to reverse course and to get on track toward dealing effectively with North Korea on critical issues such as the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Details of the South Korean investigation of the Cheonan tragedy have not been made public, and undercurrents of opposition to its conclusions are growing stronger in Seoul. We do not know yet whether Mr. Carter discussed the Cheonan issue while he was in Pyongyang. We do know that the former U.S. president is respected in North Korea for having had a friendly and useful conversation with Kim Il-sung, the first North Korean ruler, in 1994. Thus it is likely that he did hear from North Korean leaders their version of what happened. In my own meetings with North Korean officials over the years, I know them to be frank and articulate in expressing their government’s positions. Thus I believe that Mr. Carter, known for his independence and his willingness to enter into controversy, may well have come back with more than Mr. Gomes. The insights he will have picked up from his talks with top leaders other than Kim Jong-il should coincide with an emerging realization within the Obama administration that its current stance toward the North, featuring sanctions and hostility, is having little positive impact, and that a return to some form of dialogue with Pyongyang needs to be considered. Stephen Bosworth, a former ambassador to Seoul and now the U.S. special envoy for North Korean issues, has long favored more dialogue with Pyongyang. There also is a growing realization in Washington that alienating China is an inordinately high price to pay for putting pressure on Pyongyang. So the White House, in  choosing to send Mr. Carter at this time, may deserve credit for seeking to change a hostile stance toward North Korea into a more effective policy.

Three new movies show that it is possible to bypass or subvert official channels when dealing with North Korea.
==::==
2010-03-28T00:00:00Z
==::==
Besides being a dictator, a political thorn for the West and a Dr. Evil-like figure of pop culture ridicule, the North Korean leader Kim Jong-il is also a film buff. Other dictators have taken an interest in cinema as a propaganda tool — Stalin exploited Sergei Eisenstein and Hitler hired Leni Riefenstahl — but Mr. Kim has gone further. The Dear Leader, as he is called, is the author of the textbook cum manifesto “On the Art of the Cinema.” He has been known to function as a hands-on mogul in the state-run film industry, rewriting scripts and nurturing pet projects. In 1978 — while running the propaganda department under his father, Kim Il-sung, the country’s founding president — he even arranged the kidnapping of Shin Sang-ok, a South Korean director, whom he tasked with improving the quality of North Korean movies. But while Mr. Kim’s cinephilic ardor is well established, the cinema of and about North Korea remains as murky as one would expect of a nation routinely described as a hermit kingdom and an information black hole. North Korean movies are produced for internal consumption. Films about North Korea by outsiders run into the predictable problem of access. Views of the country are largely limited to satellite images  and footage of showpiece spectacles like the “mass games,” stadium-filling pageants of synchronized acrobatics. The British filmmaker Daniel Gordon has recently made a series of documentaries in North Korea on subjects like soccer players (“The Game of Their Lives”), gymnasts (“A State of Mind”) and an American defector (“Crossing the Line”). While his films convey some sense of life north of the 38th parallel, their collective reticence suggests an understandable reluctance to offend his hosts. Three new films, however,  show in very different ways that it is  possible to bypass or subvert official channels when dealing with North Korea. N. C. Heikin’s documentary“Kimjongilia,”now playing in New York, draws on refugee testimony, as recent nonfiction books have done. “The Red Chapel,” by the Danish journalist Mads Brugger, is a culture-clash comedy as well as an ambush documentary in the vein of Sacha Baron Cohen and the Yes Men.“The Juche Idea,”by the American experimental filmmaker Jim Finn, uses the theories of Kim Jong-il to satirize the process of art making under both socialist and capitalist systems. The starting point for “Kimjongilia,” named for the flower created for Mr. Kim’s 46th birthday, was Kang Chol-hwan’s memoir “Aquariums of Pyongyang,” one of the first accounts of life in a North Korean gulag. After hearing Mr. Kang speak at a conference, Ms. Heikin optioned his book, intending to make a drama. The project evolved into a documentary about that country’s human-rights abuses — the summary imprisonments and executions, the needless famine of the mid-’90s — that Mr. Kang and others have brought to light. “The idea was to put a human face on it,” Ms. Heikin said. “A bunch of statistics would not have worked.” She supplemented her interviews with dance sequences inspired by the movements of the female traffic controllers who are among the most visible symbols of North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang. (The city has no traffic lights.) Ms. Heikin also spliced in excerpts from propaganda films that she ordered from an Internet retailer, setting the litany of recounted horrors against “how North Korea portrayed itself,” she said. Like Ms. Heikin, Mr. Brugger wanted to depict North Korea as a real place with real problems, not an abstract nuclear threat. The best way to do so, he decided, would be to go there. He enlisted two Danish-Korean performers, Jacob Nossell and Simon Jul, to pose as a comedy duo, and  sought permission to visit  on a cultural exchange program. Mr. Brugger and his accomplices were allowed to perform in Pyongyang and document their preparations, as long as their tapes were turned over nightly for screening. “The Red Chapel,” which won the world-cinema documentary prize at Sundance in January and will be shown next Saturday and Sunday at the New Directors/New Films festival in Manhattan, traffics in what Mr. Brugger calls role-play journalism. He first tried this tactic in a  television series,  “Danes for Bush,” in which he pretended to campaign for the 2004 re-election of President George W. Bush. He came to regard the project as flawed. “It’s too easy making fun of Republican Americans,” he said. For a follow-up Mr. Brugger asked himself, “Is there a place where the use of lying and immoral behavior is acceptable?” As he had expected, there were no opportunities for major exposés while in North Korea: the group’s translator doubled as a minder. “There’s no smoking gun, but everything is between the lines,” he said, adding that the film functions as “a study of how an authoritarian regime destroys human emotion and interaction.” In his voice-over Mr. Brugger theorizes that the North Koreans were exploiting their guests for propaganda purposes. There is no mistaking the public-relations value of Mr. Nossell and Mr. Jul,  South Korean-born Danes,  choosing the North for their homecoming. Mr. Brugger admitted that he was himself guilty of using Mr. Nossell, who suffers from spastic paralysis and uses a wheelchair, as a kind of test case. North Korea watchers have long suspected Pyongyang, which has no disabled people, of sending those residents into exile (or worse). “People would ask Jacob if he was drunk or sick because they’d never seen anyone with a handicap,” Mr. Brugger said. While most books and films about this hermetic regime try to peel away the scrim of party-line misinformation, “The Juche Idea” does more or less the opposite: it co-opts the language of North Korean agitprop. As an independent filmmaker, Mr. Finn said, he was struck by the low-budget resourcefulness of the North Korean movies he found for sale on eBay and by the film theories of Kim Jong-il, which often relate to the national philosophy of “juche,” roughly translated as self-reliance. One of his maxims, for instance, prescribes that films be made quickly, cheaply and with the proper ideology. “It’s already what I was doing, like I had my own quasi-Marxist state in my apartment,” Mr. Finn said. “So I decided to make my own juche film.” Steeped in the obsolete language of revolutionary art, Mr. Finn’s meticulous, deadpan mockumentaries often play like unearthed artifacts from an alternate universe. His 2006 film“Interkosmos”is set aboard an East German mission to the moons of Jupiter and Saturn.“The Shining Trench of President Gonzalo”(2007) purports to be a record of Shining Path Maoists at a Peruvian women’s prison. (Mr. Finn’s work, including “The Juche Idea,” will be featured at a retrospective at Anthology Film Archives from May 27 through June 2.) Partly inspired by the Shin Sang-ok kidnapping, “The Juche Idea” centers on Yoon (played by Jung Yoon Lee), a South Korean artist who has been invited to — or perhaps detained at — a North Korean artists’ residence. When not performing her farm duties, she makes “insect-based bio-art” (including what the credits term a “Kim Jong-il flyface sculpture”) and strives to find the politically correct pitch for video pieces like “The Dentures of Imperialism.” Yoon’s videos — the result of Mr. Finn simultaneously adhering to and parodying juche thought — combine annotated clips from actual North Korean propaganda with what he described as the American equivalent: Voice of America “slow English” broadcasts valorizing Ronald Reagan. It is safe to assume that not one of these disparate views of North Korea will find a North Korean audience. “Kimjongilia” was warmly received last year at South Korea’s largest film festival, in Pusan, Ms. Heikin said. “The Red Chapel” was shown at a South Korean-run festival adjacent to the demilitarized zone, and Mr. Brugger said the North Korean authorities were aware of the film. “They sent a fax to Danish television saying the difference between man and animal is that man has a conscience and animal does not,” he said. Mr. Finn invited North Korea’s United Nations ambassador to a screening of “The Juche Idea,” but did not hear back. “I’m open to showing the film in North Korea,” Mr. Finn said, “but I might inject a GPS or radio-frequency ID tag into my skin first.”

BEIJING (AP) — An American missionary arrived in Beijing on Saturday after being freed byNorth Korea, which had detained him for illegally crossing its border from China on Christmas Day. The missionary, Robert Park, appeared pale and drawn as United States consular officials escorted him from a North Korean plane at Beijing’s airport. He did not say anything. Susan Stevenson, a spokeswoman for the United States Embassy, said that Mr. Park would leave later in the day for the United States. On Friday, North Korea announced it would free Mr. Park, saying he had shown “sincere repentance.” Mr. Park, 28,slipped across the frozen Tumen Riverinto North Korea carrying letters calling on its leader, Kim Jong-il, to close the country’s notoriously brutal prison camps and step down from power — statements that could bring a death sentence. The North Korean government decided, however, “to leniently forgive and release him, taking his admission and sincere repentance of his wrongdoings into consideration,” the official Korean Central News Agency said. The news agency quoted Mr. Park, of Tucson, Ariz., as saying he was ashamed of the “biased” view he had once held of North Korea. He did not respond Saturday to questions from reporters at Beijing’s airport asking whether he had been speaking freely or under duress. “We are just elated that he’s been released safely,” the Rev. Madison Shockley, a Park family pastor in Carlsbad, Calif., said by telephone. “We cannot wait for him to land on American soil and to hear the truth of what he discovered there.” Mr. Shockley said that Mr. Park’s parents were told of the release by the State Department on Friday and were very happy but almost in shock. “The mother will only truly believe it when he is in her arms,” Mr. Shockley said. Messages left for Mr. Park’s parents and brother were not immediately returned.

Surely the only mystery about Bill Clinton’s recent visit to North Korea   is why  didn’t he go sooner. Most likely, the answer is that the Bush administration wouldn’t allow this kind of engagement. The recent success must be quickly followed up by ensuring that South Korea supports a new initiative to defuse the North’s nuclear posturing. David John Wood,   Chikushino City, Japan Scare tactics in U.S. health care debate The current debate over the “public option” for American health care sounds a good deal like the recent argument over the injection of public funds into the  banking sector. In each case, there has been powerful industry opposition to any tighter government regulation. Just as Wall Street warned of the supposed dangers of stifling “innovation” (trading in risky but profitable derivatives), the insurance and drug companies are now using scare tactics to try to convince the American public that any publicly supported health plan will mean the end of medical care as we know it. But what nearly destroyed the financial system was greed, not regulation or government competition. How much longer will America continue to stand by and watch its health care system go down the same road? Roger Algase,  New York With his poll numbers heading south and an increasingly number of Americans growing skeptical of his  health care plan, President Obama is now charging that the Republican Party is being “dishonest” about the debate. But  it was Democrats who screamed for years that former President Bush “lied” and “took us to war under false pretenses,” and now that the Democrats have control of the government they have failed to back these charges with any criminal proceedings. And Mr. Obama claims the other party is being dishonest? Does anyone see a tinge of hypocrisy here? Eugene R. Dunn,    Medford, New York

Authorities detained a North Korean vessel, the first time a ship has been seized and boarded under sanctions adopted by the U.N. Security Council.

NEW DELHI — Indian authorities have detained a North Korean vessel and are searching it for radioactive material, the first time a ship has been seized and boarded under sanctions adopted by theUnited Nations Security Councilin June. The cargo ship, M V San, was spotted Friday, officials said, and detained under the authority of the United Nations resolution passed afterNorth Koreatested a nuclear device in May. The ship anchored without authorization in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a territory of India in the Bay of Bengal, last week, according to the Indian military. Indian officials said it was carrying more than 16,000 tons of sugar bound for the Middle East. But the ship’s proximity to Myanmar, a North Korean ally, and the fact that it had no apparent reason to be in the area raised suspicions. The coast guard intercepted the ship after chasing it for six hours, and detained 39 North Korean crew members. After two days of searching and of questioning the crew, India’s Navy and Coast Guard handed the ship over to police and intelligence services, having found no evidence of illegal cargo, according to the Press Trust of India. Ashok Chand, a senior police officer in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, told Reuters that further tests were being conducted. But it remains a mystery why the ship was in Indian waters at all. India has watched warily for signs that North Korea is helping Myanmar build a nuclear reactor. Adm. Sureesh Mehta of the Indian Navy told reporters in Delhi over the weekend that “the ship had no business to be there.” The Security Council resolution, intended to punish North Korea for its nuclear test, forbids North Korea to traffic in a wide range of nuclear and conventional weaponry and calls on United Nations members to search North Korean ships, with the crews’ consent, if there are “reasonable grounds” to suspect that banned cargo is aboard. The United States Navy tracked a North Korean freighter suspected of carrying banned cargo for about three weeks in June and July. As an American destroyer shadowed the ship, North Korea said it would consider its interception an act of war. The ship, believed to be heading to Myanmar, finally turned back to its home port without incident. Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, has long been suspected of buying North Korean arms as well as providing transit services for North Korean vessels engaged in illicit trade.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreasaid on Monday that it was open to a form of dialogue to help resolve the dispute with the United States over itsnuclear weaponsprogram — but not to six-nation talks involving other regional powers. The statement, from North Korea’s Foreign Ministry, was seen as an unusually conciliatory-sounding expression of willingness to engage the United States in direct, one-on-one talks — a longstanding North Korean preference. The statement followed remarks over the weekend by Sin Son-ho, the top North Korean diplomat at the United Nations, who said his government was “not against a dialogue” with Washington. North Korea’s suggestion appeared to brighten the prospects for dialogue between Pyongyang and Washington after months of tensions punctuated by the North’s long-range rocket launching in April and its second nuclear test in May. There was no immediate reaction from Washington to the North Korean Foreign Ministry’s statement on Monday. The Obama administration has indicated that it is willing to engage the North in direct talks, but only if the North agrees to return to six-nation talks, a position reiterated over the weekend by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who just completed a visit to Asia. Those talks also include South Korea, China, Japan and Russia. The North Korean Foreign Ministry’s statement said the six-party talks were dead the moment that member countries agreed to the international sanctions that the United Nations Security Council imposed on North Korea following the May 25 nuclear test. The North has said those sanctions violate its sovereignty. But the ministry’s statement on Monday added, “There is a specific and reserved form of dialogue that can address the current situation.” North Korea has said the purpose of the six-nation talks was to “disarm and incapacitate” it.

A cargo ship reportedly steaming toward Myanmar poses the first test of how far the U.S. and its allies will go to stop the North’s suspected arms trade.

SEOUL, South Korea — A North Korean ship shadowed by an AmericanNavydestroyer and possibly heading toward Myanmar on Sunday could pose the first test of  how far the United States and its allies will go under a newUnited Nationsresolution to stop the North’s military shipments. The United States began tracking the ship, the 2,000-ton freighter Kang Nam, after it left Nampo, a port near Pyongyang, the North’s capital, on Wednesday. Pentagon officials have said they suspect the ship is carrying prohibited materials, but they have declined to say where it may  be headed. A South Korean cable news network, YTN, on Sunday quoted an unidentified intelligence source as saying that Myanmar was the destination of the freighter, which may be carrying missile components. North Koreahas said it would consider interception an “act of war” and react accordingly. Over the weekend, the North’s state-run news media said the country vowed to  “respond to sanctions with retaliation” and  threatened “unlimited retaliatory strikes” against South Korea if it cooperated with the sanctions imposed by  the United Nations Security Council. Myanmar, formerly known as Burma,  is ruled by a military junta and has long been suspected of buying North Korean arms as well as providing transit services for North Korean vessels engaged in illicit trade. The Kang Nam is the first North Korean vessel to be trackedunder the resolutionadopted by the Security Council on June 12 to punish North Korea for its May 25 nuclear test. The resolution forbids North Korea to traffic in a wide range of nuclear and conventional weaponry and calls on United Nations members to search North Korean ships, with the crews’ consent, if there are “reasonable grounds” to suspect that banned cargo is aboard. If the crew does not accept inspection on the high seas, North Korea is to direct the vessel to a port for inspection by local authorities there. Because Myanmar is another nation defying international weapons sanctions, a port there would be unlikely to comply with the resolution. Shortly after North Korea conducted its first nuclear test in 2006, the Kang Nam was detained in Hong Kong following a Council resolution banning trade in nuclear and ballistic missile technology. But then the ship was found to be carrying no cargo. The potential high-seas confrontation over the Kang Nam came as American defense officials planned to travel this week to South Korea, Japan and China to discuss how to enforce the sanctions. Last week, the United States urged banks to become more vigilant against financial transactions involving North Korea. The United States also said it had deployed a floating radar base near Hawaii to guard against a long-range North Korean missile test, which the North Koreans have said they may conduct soon, possibly around July 4. Questioned about the North’s behavior, President Obama said in a taped interview with CBS News to be broadcast  Monday that “this administration — and our military — is fully prepared for any contingencies.” Mr. Obama would not specify if he meant the United States would respond militarily to a North Korean missile launching aimed at Hawaii. But he said, “I do want to give assurances to the American people that the T’s are crossed and the I’s are dotted in terms of what might happen.”

SEOUL, South Korea (Reuters) —North Koreaplans Thursday to try two American journalists who it says entered the country illegally and with what it calls “hostile intent.” The controversial case comes as the North faces international anger over its nuclear test last week. Experts said that a guilty verdict was all but certain and that the two reporters, who were arrested on North Korea’s border with China in March, were likely to become bargaining chips in high-stakes negotiations with the United States, which has long sought to curb North Korea’s nuclear ambitions. “North Korean law states that a person convicted of highly hostile acts can be subject to forced labor for a period of 10 years or more,” said Park Jeong-woo, a law professor at Kookmin University in South Korea and an expert on the North’s legal system. Very little has been heard from the two reporters, Euna Lee and Laura Ling, of Current TV, since their arrest, but they have been seen by Sweden’s ambassador to North Korea on behalf of Washington.

SINGAPORE — Defense SecretaryRobert M. GateswarnedNorth Koreaon Saturday that the United States would not accept it as anuclear weaponsstate, as Asian security officials struggled to find a new way to deal with the isolated Communist nation. “We will not stand idly by as North Korea builds the capability to wreak destruction on any target in Asia — or on us,” Mr. Gates told a major defense conference here that has been dominated byNorth Korea’s test this weekof a nuclear device and the firing of at least six short-range missiles, all in defiance of international sanctions. Mr. Gates said that he did not considerNorth Korea’s nuclear program“a direct military threat” to the United States, but added that its progress “is a harbinger of a dark future.” One of the chief concerns among United States officials is that North Korea will sell its nuclear technology. Although Mr. Gates said that the administration was planning to discuss with its Asian allies how to move forward with the six-party talks aimed at persuading the North to give up its nuclear weapons program, he acknowledged during a question and answer session that “it would be hard to point to them at this point as an example of success.” In Washington on Saturday, a senior American official confirmed South Korean news reports of indications that the North was preparing to ship an inter-continental ballistic missile toward a missile testing site on the Sea of Japan, a sign that Pyongyang might be planning another long-range missile test. It would likely take several weeks for the missile to reach the site and be put in place, and there is still no evidence that the North Koreans have the technology to create a nuclear device small enough to fit atop a missile. The North Koreans have conducted two such tests before,including one over Japanese territory, and American officials are particularly concerned about Japanese reaction to another test. Such missiles are theoretically capable of reaching Alaska and Hawaii. A C.I.A. assessment has concluded that North Korea has built one or two nuclear weapons and harvested the fuel for six or more weapons. Throughout the day at the annual conference in Singapore, called theShangri-La Dialogue, Mr. Gates met with defense officials from China, South Korea, Japan and other Asian nations to try to begin pulling together an international consensus on how to proceed. James B. Steinberg, the deputy Secretary of State, attended a number of the meetings, as did Dennis C. Blair, the director of national intelligence. There was talk of toughening economic sanctions on North Korea and a widespread view that long-running six-nation talks aimed at getting North Korea to give up its nuclear program had failed. Beyond that, nothing specific emerged. “There’s no prescription yet on what to do,” said a senior American defense official who asked for anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. The official said that one “prudent option” was “what should we be thinking about in the event that we need to start enhancing our posture, our defenses?” But the official said that it was premature to talk of building up American forces in the region — an echo ofcomments from Mr. Gates on Fridaythat the United States had no plans to reinforce some 28,000 American troops based in South Korea. Late in the day, Mr. Gates had a three-way meeting focused on North Korea with the defense ministers of South Korea and Japan, a precursor to more detailed discussions to occur next week in Tokyo, Seoul and Beijing about North Korea’s nuclear test. Mr. Steinberg is to lead the American team at those meetings; the group will include Stuart Levey, the Treasury Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, an indication that tough economic measures against North Korea will be a significant part of the discussions. Military officials traveling with Mr. Gates said the tough talk was aimed in large part at increasing worldwide pressure on North Korea as well as reassuring allies in the region, particularly Japan and South Korea, that the United States was committed to their defense should North Korea make good on its talk of war this week. On Wednesday, North Korea threatened military strikes against the South. Mr. Gates met early on Saturday with the highest-ranking official sent to the conference by China, Lt. Gen. Ma Xiaotian, the deputy chief of the general staff of the People’s Liberation Army. American Defense officials said after the meeting that China, the country that has the most influence over North Korea,  clearly viewed the nuclear test seriously, a reflection of General Ma’s public remarks at the conference. “We are resolutely opposed to nuclear proliferation,” General Ma said, adding that “we hope that all parties concerned will remain cool-headed and take measured measures to address the problem.” The United States has been pressing the Chinese government for a tough response, but it remains unclear if China is willing to engage in a heightened showdown with North Korea. In the past, China has feared the collapse of North Korea’s government could lead to refugees pouring across its border. In Moscow, the Kremlin issued a statement saying President Dmitri A. Medvedev and Prime Minister  Taro Aso of Japan had agreed on the need for a serious response to the nuclear test, Reuters reported. In Mr. Gates’ formal remarks at the conference, his first as an emissary of President Obama, he made clear that the new administration had limited patience with North Korea’s bellicose words and behavior. “President Obama has offered an open hand to tyrannies that unclench their fists,” Mr. Gates said. “He is hopeful, but he is not naïve. Likewise, the United States and our allies are open to dialogue, but we will not bend to pressure or provocation.” Military officials acknowledged that the United States had only limited information about what was really happening inside North Korea and suspected  that its leader, Kim Jong-il, was in the midst of political maneuvers to make his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, his successor. The officials described the country’s leadership as unpredictable and bizarre. Although North Korea was the “hot topic” at the conference, as Mr. Gates put it, the defense secretary also used the forum to appeal to Asian allies for help, both financial and military, with the war in Afghanistan. “I know some in Asia have concluded that Afghanistan does not represent a strategic threat for their countries, owing in part to Afghanistan’s geographic location,” Mr. Gates said. “But the threat from failed or failing states is international in scope.” The defense secretary said that extremists in Asia who have engaged in terrorism in Bali and guerrilla warfare in the Philippines “are inspired by, and at times have received support directly from, groups operating along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border — the ungoverned space from which this threat ultimately emanates.” Failure in Afghanistan, Mr. Gates said, “would have international reverberations — and, undoubtedly, many of them would be felt in this part of the world.” In representing Mr. Obama, Mr. Gates sought to draw a distinction between the new president and his predecessor. Mr. Gates noted that Mr. Obama had spent part of his childhood in Indonesia and that it was the first time “that we have had a president with such a personal connection to the region.” Mr. Gates concluded that the United States, “in our efforts to protect our own freedom, and that of others” had “from time to time made mistakes, including at times being arrogant in dealing with others.” Mr. Gates did not name names, but then said, “We always correct our course.”

Parliament gave Kim Jong-il a five-year term as he made his first major public appearance since his reported stroke in August.
==::==
2009-04-10T00:00:00Z

SEOUL, South Korea — The North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, returned to center stage in the North’s capital, Pyongyang, on Thursday when the country’s Parliament elected him to another five-year term. But the secretive government gave no clues, after months of questions about Mr. Kim’s failing health, as to which of his three sons would be prepared to succeed him. State television showed Mr. Kim, 67, receiving a standing ovation as he walked, with a slight limp, into the session of the rubber-stamp Supreme People’s Assembly. In contrast to his former paunchy build, he looked gaunt and older, but he maintained his authority, returning the applause and motioning the delegates to be seated. He appeared to have difficulty using his left hand because of,doctors believe, a stroke he suffered last August. It was the first major public appearance by Mr. Kim since hisreported stroke, and it followed months of speculation about his grip on power. The Assembly re-elected him chairman ofNorth Korea’s most powerful ruling agency, theNational Defense Commission. Also elected to the commission were Ju Gyu-chang, a senior defense industry official said to have led the project to launch a satellite, and Jang Song-taek, Mr. Kim’s brother-in-law. Although Mr. Jang had held relatively low ranks in the party hierarchy, he has long been considered the second most powerful man in the country. He is expected to play a crucial role in elevating one of Mr. Kim’s sons to the helm or even head a collective leadership should Mr. Kim die suddenly. With news of Mr. Kim’s re-election, North Korean media brimmed with lofty proclamations and patriotic songs praising him for “successfully” putting a satellite into orbit on board the rocket the North launched Sunday. The launching went ahead in defiance of the United States and its allies, who said it was designed to test a missile. Washington said the launching was afailureand that the satellite had not reached orbit. Analysts say that the launching of the purported satellite, Kwangmyongsong-2, or Lodestar-2, a reference to Mr. Kim’s nickname in North Korea, was meant to meet urgent domestic needs as well as to win attention from the Obama administration. The North’s rocket launching and its increasingly confrontational posture toward the United States and South Korea are widely seen here as a way of quashing rumors about Mr. Kim’s health and to show — to people at home and to adversaries abroad — that he is firmly in charge. “What we see happening in the North is not an expression of confidence, rather it shows serious internal strain and uncertainty,” said Nam Joo-hong, a North Korea specialist at Kyonggi University in South Korea. Mr. Kim is widely seen as having delayed anointing an heir because the two sons he most trusted were too young to lead a society that values maturity. “He must now hurry up,” said Cheong Seong-chang, a North Korea expert at the Sejong Institute in Seoul. Recent reshuffles at the organizational and propaganda departments of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea — the two party bodies Mr. Kim controlled while being groomed as successor in the 1970s and ’80s — signaled that a power transfer might have begun, Mr. Cheong said. But any power shift will be gradual. For now, North Korea has redoubled its efforts to show that Mr. Kim remains at the helm, even if that means releasing photos and video that show North Koreans there is something wrong with their leader. In a recent picture of him inspecting a swimming pool, Mr. Kim was clearly thinner and his facial skin seemed to be sagging — a far cry from the heroic images of him that decorate murals in every North Korean village. On Tuesday, North Korea released the first video of Mr. Kim since his stroke. Shown visiting a pig farm in early August, Mr. Kim was gesticulating to workers with both hands. Without explanation, the video jumped to late November and December, when he was shown in a parka and gloves. He kept his left hand in a pocket most of the time.

The more he struts, the weaker Kim Jong-il looks.

North Korean television watchers tuned in this week to scenes of a gleaming high-tech control room, followed by footage of a rocket rising triumphantly into space on Sunday, purportedly sending a satellite circling the earth broadcasting revolutionary songs.  Viewers also caught a glimpse of another celestial object  —  an hour-long documentary showed the country’s idolized leader, Kim Jong Il, energetically inspecting factories and farms. These were the first moving pictures of Kim since he suffered an apparent stroke last August. The propaganda pairing was clearly meant to convey an impression of strength and legitimacy. Kim, reportedly present at the launch, crowed about the triumph of “a great prosperous and powerful nation.” In reality, these are the acts of a weak, if not failing, state whose frail leader has glimpsed his own mortality and now is urgently trying to fashion his own succession before he passes from the scene. The combination of nuclear weapons and a ballistic-missile technology potentially capable of delivering a warhead to a distant target is not to be taken lightly. The launch, however, apparently failed  —  for the third time since 1998  —  to succeed in boosting a satellite into orbit. It would be a mistake to rise to the bait of Pyongyang’s provocative self-portrayal as a new member of the elite club of space and nuclear powers. To do so would only lend credibility to the regime’s claims of potency. Inside North Korea, the regime can no longer deliver even the most basic of goods.  Attempts to follow Chinese-style market reforms have proven half-hearted, mostly out of fear that they will lead to a loss of political control. Kim Jong Il leads a regime that is a hybrid of Stalinism and oriental despotism, with power passed dynastically from father to son. A trio of Mr. Kim’s sons, none of whom seem fit to rule, wait in the wings. His medical condition sped up plans to pick one as a successor, requiring him to shore up support among the military and other key power brokers. But there are hints that the populace no longer blindly buys what Mr. Kim is selling. An article in the state-run media on Tuesday portrayed Mr. Kim as a modern-day Marie Antoinette, tearfully urging his people to sacrifice for the glory of his regime. “Even though he has brought this overflowing victory, he felt sorry for not being able to spend more money on the people’s livelihoods and was choked with sobs, saying, ‘Our people will still understand,”’ Rodong Sinmun, the main North Korean daily, quoted Kim as saying. The regime is also under pressure from another source  —  South Korea. The election of a conservative government in South Korea in December 2007 led to a shift in policy, with aid tied to insistence that the North give up its nuclear weapons program. Meanwhile, North Koreans are increasingly aware that their brothers in South Korea have leapt beyond them to become a first-world economy with a vibrant democracy. Faced with those challenges, Pyongyang has chosen to close doors with the South  —  and to use events like the missile launch to bolster its fading assertion of legitimacy as the leader of the Korean nation. The advent of the Obama administration should logically have been a positive event for Pyongyang, which complained endlessly about the Bush administration’s “hostile” attitude. During her recent visit to Asia, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton put on the bargaining table all the elements of a deal that the North Koreans insist they seek  —  a formal peace treaty to end the Korean War, normalization of diplomatic relations and extensive economic aid and investment. Yet Kim Jong-il has so far refused to take up those offers to engage. Some speculate the missile launch is simply North Korea’s familiar tactic of escalating tensions in the belief that it will yield offers of new concessions and aid. If so, it is yet another case of North Korean miscalculation. The Obama administration has been publicly stern, acting in close concert with allies in Seoul and Tokyo, while being prepared to continue the 6-party negotiations on denuclearization. This is the time to be calm and realize that time is not on the side of Kim Jong Il and his shaky regime. There is no reason to close any doors, but there is also no reason to panic and inadvertently aid a state whose main victims are its own people.

The United States, South Korea, Japan, China and Russia have to stay focused on what’s most important: ending North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.
==::==

==::==
For weeks, North Korea has been talking about plans to launch a rocket sometime between April 4 and 8. Whether it intends to put a satellite in orbit — as it claims — or test a long-range missile, as the Obama administration and many others suspect, Pyongyang has fueled dangerous new tensions in East Asia. Japan has ordered  its military to destroy the missile if the launch fails and debris falls on its territory. The Pentagon has sent two missile-interceptor ships off the Korean coast, and Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Monday that they would act only if the missile appeared headed toward American territory. North Korea, meanwhile, has threatened unspecified “strong steps” if the United Nations Security Council decides to penalize it for the launch. Before things get any worse, we urge the North Koreans to reconsider this foolhardy course. China, which has significant leverage — it is North Korea’s main source of oil deliveries — needs to try harder to get Pyongyang to stand down. When President Obama meets the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, on Wednesday in London, the two leaders will need to discuss ways both to moderate Pyongyang’s erratic behavior and to move forward negotiations intended to dismantle North Korea’s nuclear program. Unfortunately, this kind of dangerous misbehavior is standard procedure for North Korea. In 2006, it defied world leaders and tested both a nuclear device and a long-range missile. The Security Council imposed sanctions that have never been fully implemented and ordered Pyongyang to cease any further testing. In this case, North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-il, who had a stroke last year, may be trying to show that he’s still fully in charge — no matter the cost to his country. Or Mr. Kim and his gang may be trying to insert themselves onto Mr. Obama’s crowded agenda or sow friction among the members of the six-party nuclear talks. Whatever the motivation, the United States and its partners — South Korea, Japan, China and Russia — have to stay focused on what’s most important: ending North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. Under a 2005 agreement, North Korea shut down its reactor at Yongbyon — the source of plutonium for six or more nuclear weapons — and promised to dismantle its bomb-making infrastructure. A lot more needs to be done. And the talks are now stalled over how the international community will verify that North Korea is living up to its commitments. Work to disable the Yongbyon facilities has slowed to a crawl, and the North Koreans have not received all the fuel deliveries that Washington and its partners promised. The good news is that North Korea is not producing more plutonium for nuclear bombs. That is crucial. If Pyongyang defies the Security Council and tests a missile, there will have to be a clear — and unified — condemnation. But as soon as possible, Washington must work with its partners to find a way back to the negotiating table. However tortuous, firm and patient engagement offers the best chance of curbing Pyongyang’s nuclear ambitions and its missile program.

WASHINGTON — The United States has no plans for military action to pre-empt the launching of a long-range missile byNorth Koreaand would act only if the missile or its parts appeared to be headed toward American territory, Defense SecretaryRobert M. Gatessaid Sunday. South Korea also opposes military any military response to North Korea’s impending rocket launch, the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, said in an interview published Sunday. The descriptions by Mr. Gates and Mr. Lee of a calibrated military response were the most definitive to date as the international community, led by the United States, Japan and South Korea, pursues diplomatic action to press North Korea not to proceed with the launching of a Taepodong-2 intercontinental ballistic missile. Amid rising tensions surrounding the expected launch, North Korea on Monday detained a South Korean worker on charges of plotting against the Communist government. The worker was captured at Gaeseong, a North Korean border town where the two Koreas run a joint industrial park. An independent security think-tank releasedsatellite imageson Sunday that it said confirmed the presence of the Taepondong-2 missile on the North’s Musudan-ri launch pad. The content of the photos, analyzed by the Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, had not yet been confirmed by the Defense Department by Monday, but they echoedSouth Korean news reports last weekthat said the missile had been put in place. North Korean officials have said the launching, expected to take place between April 4 and 8, is designed solely to push a satellite into orbit. Although the peaceful, commercial and scientific use of space is protected under international law, a United Nations Security Council resolution specifically bars North Korea from testing missiles and nuclear devices. Mr. Gates said on “Fox News Sunday,” “I don’t know anyone at a senior level in the American government who does not believe this technology is intended as a mask for the development of an intercontinental ballistic missile.” Even so, Mr. Gates said the United States had no plans to take military action to halt the launching or to shoot down the missile in flight — with one exception. “If we had an aberrant missile, one that was headed for Hawaii, that looked like it was headed for Hawaii or something like that, we might consider it,” Mr. Gates said. One of America’s closest allies in the region, Japan, has authorized its military to shoot down any debris from the rocket that might fall toward its territory, and has joined the United States and South Korea in saying the launching is a cover for testing technology for a long-range missile that could carry a nuclear warhead. Japan deployed two Aegis vessels to waters off its west coast at the weekend, with an order to prepare to shoot down any debris that could fall on Japanese territory if the rocket launch fails. South Korea is also dispatching an Aegis-equipped Sejong the Great destroyer off the east coast. Dave Palmer, a spokesman for the American military in Seoul, declined to unveil the missions for two Aegis radar-equipped destroyers — USS John S. McCain and USS Chafee — which were seen docked over the weekend in Busan, a South Korean port. Rear Admiral Chae Hong-pil of the South Korean navy told foreign media reporters last week that the American vessels would move into the sea between Japan and Korea to monitor the North Korean launch. Mr. Lee, in an interview published Sunday on theFinancial Times Web site, said that while Seoul had no position on Japan’s stated intention to shoot down debris, military action in response to the launch would not be appropriate. “What I do oppose is to militarily respond to these kind of actions because it is also not in their interest to test-fire anything,” he said, referring to North Korea’s plans. All three countries have demanded that North Korea cancel the launching but have conceded there is little they can do to force acceptable behavior on the isolated government in Pyongyang, beyond threatening even more sanctions. American officials acknowledge that the launching would be the first major test for Mr. Obama in dealing with North Korea’s ambitions to field long-range missiles andnuclear weapons. The worker detained by the North on Monday faces charges of "denouncing the North’s political system and corrupting North Korean female workers in a plot to persuade them to defect to the South," a spokesman from South Korea’s Unification Ministry said, citing a notice from the North. Two American journalists captured March 17 are still also being held by the North. Analysts said the detentions appeared to be attempts by the North to increase leverage in diplomatic negotiations with Seoul and Washington. Mr. Gates’s comments came as senior administration officials, led by President Obama, took to the Sunday talk shows to describe the strategy unveiled Friday to focus American counterterrorism efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan. In battling terrorists in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the president, appearing on the CBS program “Face the Nation,” said the United States would respect Pakistani sovereignty but reserved the right to strike at important terrorist targets, after consultations with the government in Islamabad. “If we have a high-value target within our sights,” Mr. Obama said, “after consulting with Pakistan, we’re going after them.” But he stressed that those attacks would not be with American ground forces, implying that he was referring to continued strikes from the air. The American commander in the region, Gen. David H. Petraeus, appeared on CNN’s “State of the Union” and explained that “there is no intention for us to be conducting operations in there, certainly on the ground, and there is every intention by the Pakistani military and their other forces to conduct those operations.” Richard C. Holbrooke, the president’s top adviser on Afghanistan and Pakistan, said on CNN that success required overcoming tensions between Washington and Islamabad, and he cited what senior Pakistani officials have labeled “the trust deficit.” But since the Afghanistan-Pakistan strategy will require months to be put into effect, the prospect of a long-range North Korean missile launching as early as this week generated a more immediate national security risk.

Sun Mu was trained to create posters and murals for the Communist government before defecting and winning fame as a painter in the South with works that are biting parodies of the North Korean regime.

SEOUL, South Korea IN one of Sun Mu’s best-known paintings from his “Happy Children” series, uniformed North Korean kindergartners sing like birds huddled together on a clothesline, their beaming faces so alike they could be clones. At the bottom of the posterlike image, a red slogan leaps out against a yellow background: “We are all happy children!” When Sun Mu, an artist fromNorth Koreawho uses a pseudonym for security reasons, first exhibited paintings like this in Seoul two years ago, the police showed up to investigate. They had been tipped off by viewers who, missing the intended irony, were upset by what they took to be  Communist propaganda — a possible crime under South Korea’s national security laws. After all, rapturously smiling child performers are a familiar feature of North Korean pageants, and the style mimics posters celebrating the North’s authoritarian regime. “I’m not pro-Communist, far from it,” said Sun Mu, 36, who fled North Korea in 1998 to escape famine and arrived in the South in 2001. “When people look at my paintings, I hope they can hear the children asking, ‘Do you really think we’re happy?’ ” Sun Mu, who was trained to create posters and murals for the Communist government, is the first defector from the North to have won fame as a painter in the South by applying that same propagandistic style to biting parodies of the North Korean regime. His renown, however, is shaded by political concerns. In addition to adopting a pseudonym,  he refuses to allow his face to be photographed, afraid that the family he left behind might face reprisals for his art. South Korean news outlets often refer to him as the “faceless” or “nameless” artist from North Korea. His work has not always been well received. Soon after his arrival in 2001 he enrolled at Hongik University, a leading arts institution in Seoul, where his socialist-realist technique put him at odds with prevailing notions of what constituted art. One of his professors called his political imagery “cheap, fit for old barbershops” — a reference to the cold war years when South Korean barbershops often were decorated with crude propaganda posters with slogans like “Let’s exterminate Communists!” Now, many here say that imagery, with its subverted content, addresses issues central to Korean identity. “His work touches the national trauma of the divided Korea,” said Kim Dong-il, a visual arts critic and lecturer at Sogang University in Seoul. “His style is North Korean, but when he brought it to South Korea it became something completely different. The children’s smiles in his paintings become too idealized to be real. A smile is not always an expression of happiness, and can even mean the opposite.” Sun Mu’s paintings have also depicted his own fearful journey across the river border into China in 1998, and the plight of a shackled North Korean defector who was repatriated to North Korea from the same Laotian prison where he himself was detained before proceeding on to Thailand and eventually to South Korea. So far, however, his signature work has been the “Happy Children” series, with its relentlessly smiling North Korean youngsters. The smile has been variously interpreted by commentators as grotesque, a joke on the collectivism of North Korea, or a mask to hide the helplessness many North Koreans feel. SUN MU said he used to wear that smile himself. In North Korea, he and his classmates smilingly sang hymns to Kim Jong-il, the North Korean leader, and would march out to perform for soldiers and farmers toiling in the fields. “They teach you how to smile that regimented smile — there’s a certain way to shape your mouth,” he said. “We children thought we were happy. We didn’t realize that our smile was fabricated and manufactured.” Later, while serving in the North Korean Army, Sun Mu was assigned to create propaganda paintings. He produced images of North Korean soldiers cutting the throats of American soldiers or crushing Japanese invaders. “One of the rules was that South Korean puppet soldiers be depicted as small and inconsequential at the corner of the canvas and running away from North Korean soldiers,” he said with a chuckle. “We’d finish off our paintings by adding slogans like ‘Let’s defend our revolutionary leadership with our lives!’ ” He was an art student in college when he decided to flee North Korea, during a  famine in the late 1990s that is thought to have killed two million people. SOME of the political satire in his current output is hard to miss. In one painting, a woman raising her middle finger is naked except for the North Korean flag slipping off her body. Nudity is strictly forbidden in the North, denounced as capitalist decadence. Sun Mu paints something else he could never have dared to depict in the North: portraits of Mr. Kim and his  father,  North Korea’s founder, Kim Il-sung. In the North, portraits of the Kims are considered sacred, and only a few artists are authorized to paint them. In any case, the official portraits would never look like these.  In one,  Kim Jong-il is dressed not in his trademark Mao-style suit but in a pink Nike sports jacket, red Adidas pants and mismatched running shoes. Mr. Kim is transformed from supreme leader to bourgeois loafer. Nonetheless, displaying the Kims’ images has also proved controversial. When Sun Mu presented a portrait of Kim Il-sung titled “Sun of Korea” at an international biennale last September in Pusan, the South Korean organizers removed it at the last minute, saying they wanted to avoid potential problems with a “pro-Communist” painting. At an exhibition in 2007, South Korean viewers objected to a Sun Mu portrait of Kim Jong-il that carried the title “God of Korea.” They apparently did not notice that the North Korean flag in the background had been hung upside down. Sun Mu is undeterred. “I cannot help being political,” he said. “How can I ignore the reality of the North, where my parents are still suffering? I would like to believe that art can change the world in whatever little way it can.”

The confirmation comes a day after the United States said it will remove North Korea from its terrorism blacklist.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreawelcomed its removal from Washington’s list of terrorism sponsors and confirmed on Sunday that it would resume disabling its main nuclear weapons complex and allow international monitors back to the site. Washington’s decision to take North Korea off the list of state sponsors of terrorism, announced Saturday, is an important symbolic gesture for the North, an isolated and poverty-stricken country, removing one of hurdles to gaining a measure of international acceptance. But there is much in Washington’s tortuous relationship with North Korea that stays the same, including economic sanctions against the North. President Bush said in June that he was prepared to take North Korea off the terrorism list in recognition of the country’s commitment to halt its development of nuclear weapons. The offer languished for months as administration officials tried to persuade North Korean officials to allow a strict inspection program to verify that the country was keeping its word. In the end, the administration won only some concessions. The State Department said that the new agreement called for American inspectors to be granted access not only to declared nuclear sites, but also, “based on mutual consent,” to sites where the United States suspected nuclear activity. In the past, once accords were reached, North Korea and the United States have disagreed about what was promised. The North Korean position on Sunday came in the form of remarks attributed by the Korean Central News Agency, a state organ, to an unnamed spokesman for the Foreign Ministry. The remarks confirmed the State Department’s understanding that the North Korean government would return to its earlier work disabling the plutonium plant at its Yongbyon compound. But it did not mention inspections at undeclared nuclear sites. Kim Sook, the South Korean nuclear envoy, said Sunday that American officials had resorted to “indirect and condensed terminology” to facilitate a compromise, and that he believed the two sides shared an understanding of the wording. In part to fend off criticism that they did not get enough concessions from North Korea, Bush administration officials were quick to cite the long list of punitive restrictions still in force. Indeed, reporters at the State Department news conference Saturday morning were handed the list of sanctions before they were given the fact sheet that said North Korea was being removed from the terrorism list. “North Korea remains subject to numerous sanctions resulting from its 2006 nuclear test, its proliferation activities, its human rights violations and its status as a Communist state,” Sean McCormack, a State Department spokesman, said. The list of trade prohibitions is long. It includes a ban on exports of nuclear and missile-related items, heavy conventional arms and “luxury goods,” which the United Nations Security Council imposed in retaliation for North Korea’s detonating a nuclear device in October 2006. How to apply the ban on luxury goods was left to each country to determine as it saw fit; the United States tried to tailor its ban to deprive the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, of the types of goods he was reported to like most. The list included DVD players and big flat-screen television sets. John R. Bolton, a former United States ambassador to the United Nations and a sharp critic of the deal that was announced on Saturday, argues that even if taking North Korea off the terrorism list is symbolic, it  could encourage foreign investment there. “By taking them off the terrorism list, you remove one of the legitimizers of the other sanctions,” Mr. Bolton, a former under secretary of state for arms control and international security, said Sunday. “For North Korea, that was important, because it makes them look like more of a normal nation.” Worries about granting legitimacy to North Korea also appeared to color reactions in Japan. Japanese leaders had wanted to use possible removal from the terrorism list as leverage to force the North to address concerns over abductions of Japanese citizens decades ago. Although the State Department emphasized that both Mr. Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had spoken with their Japanese counterparts, the country’s finance minister, Shoichi Nakagawa, said he doubted that Japanese officials had been fully consulted beforehand. Still, on Sunday, Prime Minister Taro Aso said that Japan and the other countries negotiating with North Korea in “six-party talks” on its nuclear program would have “ample opportunity” to discuss the kidnappings. “We have not lost any leverage at all,” the Japanese prime minister was quoted as saying. The South Korean government hailed the agreement as an important breakthrough, stopping North Korea from making good on threats to reactivate its nuclear weapons program. Some hawkish members of the governing party in Seoul, which won a majority in elections in April with a promise to get tough on the North, complained that North Korea had been allowed to slip off the terrorism list without apologizing for the bombing of a South Korean passenger jet in 1987, in which 115 people were killed. North Korea was put on the terrorism list after South Korea arrested a woman who later said she was a North Korean agent and had planted a bomb on the jet. North Korea has denied involvement.

The chief American negotiator for North Korea extended his talks in Pyongyang on Thursday in an effort to salvage a crumbling nuclear disarmament deal.

SEOUL, South Korea — The chief American negotiator forNorth Koreaextended his talks in Pyongyang on Thursday in an effort to salvage a crumbling nuclear disarmament deal, while South Korean media reported that the North has been upgrading its ballistic missile test site. The unconfirmed reports about Musudan, a missile base on North Korea’s northeast coast, came as Christopher R. Hill, the United States assistant secretary of state, met North Koreans in the capital,  Pyongyang, to try to persuade them not to restart their nuclear weapons program in Yongbyon, north of the capital. Mr. Hill had been expected to return to Seoul on Thursday. Officials in Seoul declined to speculate on whether the extension of his stay was a sign of progress. The Bush administration is desperate to restore an accord that has been teetering on the edge since last week, when North Korea broke the seals that United Nations inspectors had placed on its equipment and said it was restarting a facility to manufacture bomb-grade plutonium. State Department officials maintained that Mr. Hill would not offer substantive concessions but had proposed changes in what one official described as the “choreography” of arrangements meant to verify the accord. Administration officials have acknowledged that the accord could collapse if the two sides do not reach an agreement this week. The Bush administration has already been fending off criticism from conservatives in Washington who argue that the United States should have extracted more concessions as part of the nuclear pact. Mr. Hill is trying to find a work-around. One possibility, a senior administration official said, would be to rely more heavily on China, as close to an ally as North Korea has at this point, by giving it a more prominent role in verification efforts. Under one scenario, the official said, North Korea would submit a list of its nuclear sites to China, rather than to the United States; it would still have to permit inspections from American and Chinese officials. South Korea’s mass-circulation daily Dong-A reported that North Korea has been replacing a tower crane and other components of its missile launch base at Musudan. Dong-A cited unidentified South Korean government sources but the government here said it could not confirm the report. North Korea test-fired its Taepodong-2 multi-stage ballistic missile from Musudan in 2006. The missile was configured to reach as far as the western coast of North America, missile experts said. But the test was considered a failure, its rocket fizzling out shortly after the blastoff. Although no indications were reported that North Korea was assembling a missile at Musudan for an imminent test, the activities cited by the newspaper added to international concern. Mr. Hill went to Pyongyang to try to put the nuclear disarmament deal back on track. When North Korea began disabling the Yongbyon complex last November, it was seen as a key diplomatic achievement of the Bush administration. North Korea reversed its position after the United States refused to remove it from its list of state sponsors of terrorism. To be removed from the list, Washington insists that the North agree to comprehensive inspections to ensure it is not hiding a separate, clandestine nuclear weapons program. Brinkmanship has been a familiar negotiating tactic for North Korea. On Tuesday, South Korean media reported that the North was also restoring its underground nuclear test site in Punggye, not far from Musudan. North Korea detonated a nuclear device at Punggye in October 2006. North Korea’s government has complained that the United States has not kept its part of the deal to remove the country from a list of state sponsors of terrorism, and instead has made new demands. Those include requiring North Korea to accept a strict and intrusive verification system before the United States would carry out reciprocal steps. Meanwhile, the military officials of the two Koreas held their first talks in eight months at a border village on Thursday. But the meeting ended after 90 minutes, reducing hopes for improvement in relations that have frayed since the conservative South Korean government of President Lee Myung-bak took office in February. The North Koreans spent most of the time condemning the leaflets that conservative activists in the South send into the North by balloons, South Korean delegates said.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreasaid Friday that it no longer wished to be removed from the United States’ terrorism blacklist, signaling that it is hardening its stance amid reports that its leader,Kim Jong-il, may be seriously ill. The North Korean Foreign Ministry also confirmed what the United States and South Korea have said already: it has begun to reassemble a nuclear complex that can produce weapons-grade plutonium. “We neither wish nor expect to be delisted as a ‘state sponsor of terrorism,’ ” the North’s state-run news agency, KCNA, quoted a ministry spokesman as saying. “We can go our own way.” Bravado is North Korea’s common negotiating tactic. Still, the statement bodes ill for Washington’s efforts to keep the nuclear complex, Yongbyon, north of the capital, Pyongyang, disabled. In Washington, the White House expressed concern about North Korea’s recent statements, but emphasized that the United States and its negotiating partners remained committed to the nuclear agreement and expected the North Koreans to accept a verification system of their nuclear activities. “It’s hard to know whether their statements reflect a change in policy or simply the kind of negotiating that we’ve seen before,” Stephen J. Hadley, President Bush’s national security adviser, said in an interview with reporters. North Korea has said that Washington agreed to remove it from its list of state sponsors of terrorism once it started disabling the Yongbyon complex and submitted a declaration of its nuclear activities, as it did last June. But the United States says the North must first agree to a comprehensive inspection to check whether it did not leave out crucial data in its accounting. An angry North Korea has said it would never agree to a “gangster-like” inspection and stopped disabling the nuclear complex in mid-August. Then early this month, it hauled out disabled parts from sheds and began reassembling them at their original site. It remains a mystery whether Mr. Kim gave the instruction to restart the nuclear complex or the hard-line military was acting on his behalf, after reports surface that he had suffered a stroke. Analysts have said the North’s actions may be a negotiating tactic to win concessions from the Bush administration as it looks for diplomatic successes to bolster its legacy. It may also be stalling until after the American presidential election. Even though it has begun to reassemble Yongbyon, it could take the North a year to restart the nuclear complex.

Now that American diplomats are able to negotiate, there is a chance that North Korea can be persuaded to give up its weapons. That would make the world a safer place.

For six years, President Bush rejected any serious diplomacy with North Korea. That obstinacy made the world a more dangerous place. While he was refusing to talk, Pyongyang made more fuel for more weapons and tested a nuclear device. Now that American diplomats finally have been freed to negotiate, there is a chance that North Korea can be persuaded to give up its weapons. That would make the world a safer place. The process has been undeniably frustrating. But on Thursday, after a six-month delay (and unusual forbearance from the White House) North Korea submitted for review and verification a 60-page declaration of its nuclear activities. On Friday, the North Koreans are expected to blow up a cooling tower at their Yongbyon nuclear reactor — their source for plutonium. That is political theater — CNN and other networks have been invited to watch — but it is also a welcome sign that the inward-looking North Koreans are looking for international approval. President Bush, who labeled North Korea part of the “axis of evil” and jettisoned President Bill  Clinton’s 1994 nuclear deal with Pyongyang, kept his part of the bargain. On Thursday, he lifted some Korean War-era commercial sanctions, and he said that North Korea would be removed from the list of state sponsors of terrorism in 45 days if it cooperates on verification efforts. Mr. Bush has made compromises to get to this point, including accepting a declaration that falls short of the full nuclear catalog that North Korea agreed to provide. Many questions still remain, including the extent of Pyongyang’s attempt to pursue a covert nuclear program based on highly enriched uranium and what nuclear help it gave Syria. Last September, Israel bombed a suspected nuclear reactor there. Republican hard-liners are predictably apoplectic. We don’t trust Pyongyang either. North Korea’s leaders have oppressed and impoverished their people. And we still don’t know if they have made the strategic decision to abandon their nuclear weapons or are just playing the United States and its diplomatic partners for time. The sanctions lifted on Thursday have huge symbolic importance for North Korea, but they easily can be reimposed if needed. We also know what six years of refusing to talk has produced: stalemate and enough plutonium for at least a half-dozen more weapons. We wish Mr. Bush would apply this same lesson to Iran.

The North Korean musicians who performed with members of the New York Philharmonic left the visitors impressed.
==::==
2008-02-28T00:00:00Z
==::==
PYONGYANG,North Korea— With international attention focused on theNew York Philharmonic’s music making here, it was time on Wednesday for the North Koreans to show what they could do with Mendelssohn, Wagner and Tchaikovsky. Four Philharmonic string players joined four North Korean musicians for a performance of the Mendelssohn Octet, andLorin Maazel, the orchestra’s music director, led the State Symphony Orchestra of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea’s official name) in a brief rehearsal and run-through of the prelude to “Die Meistersinger” and the fantasy-overture “Romeo and Juliet.” It was billed as a morning of informal coaching, but the North Korean musicians, who had clearly rehearsed to within an inch of their lives, left the Philharmonic delegation stunned by their ability. “They were fantastic,” Mr. Maazel said as he walked off the stage. “They are a marvelous group, very professional, very together, very focused.” He said the North Koreans were playing from orchestral parts marked by him, and they seemed to have mastered his directions. “I was just totally blown away,” he said. In several ways the session reflected much of how this 48-hour trip, which ended on Wednesday afternoon when the orchestra flew to Seoul, the South Korean capital, had gone. While many activities were planned for the Philharmonic, including master classes, there was little sustained interaction between the Americans and the North Koreans. And the meticulously prepared playing by the North Koreans on Wednesday was in keeping with their efforts to put the best face forward to counter negative images of their country. After numerous reports about energy shortages and no heat, the orchestra’s hotel rooms were stifling. In the face of a recent history of famine and reports of malnutrition, the quantity of food at banquets and breakfasts was extravagant. At the same time the visitors from New York were left surprised by what they had found. The sessions took place at the Moranbong Theater, Pyongyang’s most elegant hall. It was built in 1946, gutted in the war and rebuilt. Glenn Dicterow, the concertmaster, and Lisa Kim, violinists; Cynthia Phelps, principal violist; and Carter Brey, principal cellist, were joined in second chairs by four North Korean string players whose names were not released. Zarin Mehta, the orchestra’s president, said three were from the State Symphony and the other was a promising young violinist. They played a polished rendition of the octet to a full audience, which remained motionless and intent, as  did the audience at the concert on Tuesday at a larger theater. One young man in the last row peered at a miniature score during the performance. At the end the four Americans received bouquets, and Mr. Dicterow tried to hand his to the North Korean next to him. The player refused it. The group then played, without rehearsal, a piece by a 12-year-old New York schoolgirl, Farah Taslima, as part of an orchestra educational project. Jon Deak, a double-bass player and composer involved in the project, told the audience that the girl had offered it to the people of North Korea. “It is a beautiful, brief song from a child’s heart,” he said. Mr. Dicterow later said that the Philharmonic musicians had come prepared to work on the first movement of the Mendelssohn with the North Koreans and did not expect a formal performance. Ms. Phelps pointed out that she was even wearing snow boots. But the first measures made clear that little rehearsal was needed, and they decided to plow through the whole piece, Mr. Dicterow said. “It seems like they are complete veterans in this music,” he added. “They are so attuned and sensitive to what we were doing.” The Americans said the North Koreans played with flexibility and responsiveness, matching their subtle shifts in tempo, bow pressure and vibrato, and used body language to communicate. Mr. Brey called them “consummate chamber musicians” who played without tentativeness. Mr. Dicterow praised the players’ sound but pointed out that it would be even better with high-quality instruments. Yet there was little verbal interaction. The two groups of performers had met only minutes before the performance and exchanged few words. After it was over, the North Koreans quickly left the area. Ms. Kim, who is of Korean descent and speaks the language, said she had discussed only a few musical points with the violinist sitting next to her. “We had some eye contact, and we were smiling, which I really didn’t expect,” she said. “It would have been nice” to speak more to the North Koreans, she added. Next the State Symphony took the stage. A recent report from the official Korean Central News Agency said the orchestra had been founded in 1970, an event proclaimed by its playing of the “immortal revolutionary paean ‘Song of General Kim Il-sung,’ ” in honor of North Korea’s founder and figure of cult worship. It is known for works like “Rich Harvest Comes to the Chongsan Plain” and “The Sea of Blood,” the news agency said, but also “wonderfully performs” European classical music. It has become a “world-famous art troupe under the wise guidance” of Kim and his son, Kim Jong-il, the current leader. Before the fall of Communism in Europe the State Symphony made several tours behind the Iron Curtain, said David Heather, who is helping organize a visit by the symphony to Britain in September and attended Wednesday’s session. He said North Korean officials told him they would like to have the orchestra visit the United States. “The question is funding, of course,” he said. “There’s a willingness on both sides.” Mr. Maazel rehearsed by pointing to places in the part for the concertmaster, who relayed to the orchestra where to play, and by singing to demonstrate. In the Wagner he sought more expression from a violin line and urged the winds to play staccatissimo at one point. Normally precise and contained in his conducting technique, Mr. Maazel exaggerated his motions a bit, pointing emphatically at the timpani or tamping down the violins with his hand. The orchestra sound was harsh, perhaps because the hall was small. The woodwind and brass instruments were of lesser quality than those in the West. The strings played with extraordinary precision and vigor. Many musicians swayed in time to the music. The intonation was good. Except for the harpist the North Korean orchestra was entirely male, although its main conductor was a woman. Mr. Dicterow said an interpreter had explained that the gender makeup followed that of the Vienna Philharmonic in the old days. The conductor, Mun Yong Ho, sat in the audience watching intently, with her arms crossed or chin in hand. When it was over, Mr. Maazel briefly addressed the players, who responded by clapping and rapping their string instruments with knuckles. “I told them,” Mr. Maazel said, “that in the world of music, all men and women are brothers and sisters.”

WASHINGTON, Oct. 2 — The United States has endorsed a plan for  dismantlingNorth Korea’s nuclear facilities by the end of the year, Bush administration officials said  Tuesday. Negotiators reached agreement on a draft in Beijing on Sunday after four days of six-nation talks, but said at the time that they needed final approval from their superiors  in Moscow, Washington, Seoul, Tokyo, Beijing and Pyongyang. The draft sets out a timetable for North Korea to disclose all its nuclear programs and disable all facilities in return for 950,000 metric tons of fuel oil or its equivalent in economic aid. Under an agreement reached in February, North Korea has shut down its plutonium-producing reactor at Yongbyon. Christopher R. Hill, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs and the lead American negotiator, had breakfast on Tuesday with his two bosses — Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and President Bush — to brief them on progress, said Sean D. McCormack, the State Department spokesman. “We have conveyed to the Chinese government our approval for the draft statement,” Mr. McCormack said. “All the parties went back to their capitals. We studied it, examined it, gave our approval to the Chinese.” The other five parties to the talks — Russia, China, South Korea, Japan, and North Korea — have yet to publicly discuss their views. But Mr. Hill said, “I believe the other parties are ready to sign on.” He said  he had been in contact with several of the other negotiators. The prospect of progress in the disarmament talks came as the leaders of North and South Korea began a three-day summit meeting  in Pyongyang, the North’s capital, only the second such meeting between the states since the Korean Peninsula was divided in 1945. During a briefing with reporters on Tuesday, Mr. Hill declined to provide details of the draft agreement, but he said he expected China to release a statement in the next “day or two” on behalf of all six countries  participating in the talks. A senior administration official said that as part of the agreement, North Korea would make a full declaration of all nuclear programs by the end of the year and would complete the disabling of the Yongbyon facility. “They have shut it down,” the official said, “but disabling means taking it apart.” North Korea has also been seeking a joint statement that would include a written reference to being removed from a United States list of countries that sponsor terrorism. The official said that “we’ve agreed on a way forward on that,” but declined to elaborate further. The official asked that his name not be used because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the issue. A second senior administration official said  the United States has told North Korea that one of the things it must disclose are details of whatever nuclear material it has been supplying to Syria. American and Israeli officials have indicated that a recent Israeli airstrike in Syria was directed at nuclear material supplied by North Korea. If the North Koreans meet the schedule and disable their equipment, it would be a major victory for the Bush administration at a time when it is eager to claim progress on some diplomatic front to offset its problems in Iraq.

SEOUL, South Korea, Sept. 3 —North Koreaannounced Monday that the United States had agreed to lift economic sanctions and remove it from a list of countries accused of sponsoring terrorism, a move that would satisfy one of the North Korean government’s principal conditions for giving up nuclear weapons. But a State Department spokeswoman in Washington said she did not have confirmation of the North Korean announcement, and Christopher R. Hill, the chief American envoy, made it clear in comments on Sunday that the North Koreans still had work to do before the United States would take the country off the terrorism-sponsor list. Mr. Hill said Sunday that North Korea would detail and disable its nuclear programs by the end of the year, an action that  would be a diplomatic victory for the Bush administration. “The U.S. agreed to take political and economic compensation measures such as deleting the D.P.R.K. from the list of terror-supporting nations and fully lifting sanctions imposed under the Trading with the Enemy Act,” a spokesman for the North Korean Foreign Ministry told the country’s official Korean Central News Agency on Monday. The spokesman was using the initials for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the North’s formal name. North Korea, in turn, discussed “taking practical measures to neutralize the existing nuclear facilities in the D.P.R.K. within this year and agreed on them,” the spokesman said. “This has laid a groundwork for making progress at the plenary session of the six-party talks to be held in the future.” The developments followed a weekend meeting between Mr. Hill and his North Korean counterpart, Kim Kye-gwan, in Geneva. In talking to reporters on Sunday, Mr. Hill said, “One thing that we agreed on is that the D.P.R.K. will provide a full declaration of all of their nuclear programs and will disable their nuclear programs by the end of this year, 2007.” Whether to offer the North rewards — including oil and, eventually, removal from the list of state sponsors of terrorism and diplomatic recognition — has been the subject of a six-year-long struggle within the Bush administration. But most of the administration hawks who have opposed such offers, such as the former American ambassador to the United Nations, John R. Bolton, are now gone. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has given Mr. Hill more latitude to negotiate with the North Koreans outside of six-party talks that have been held on and off for years. Those talks  also include China, Japan, South Korea and Russia, and are expected to resume in mid-September. The weekend meeting in Geneva was cast as a prelude to any agreement reached at the six-party talks.

An American inquiry found that development money was paid to a North Korean entity closely associated with that nation’s programs to develop unconventional weapons.

WASHINGTON, June 9  — Senior American diplomats at theUnited Nationshave compiled new information indicating that several million dollars in United Nations development money had been paid to a North Korean entity closely associated with that nation’s programs to develop unconventional weapons and sell missiles abroad. According to diplomats at the United Nations headquarters in New York, the American inquiry found that the development money forNorth Koreahad also been used to purchase “dual use” equipment, which has both civilian and military applications, including mass spectrometers, sophisticated global positioning systems and advanced computer hardware. The diplomats, speaking on traditional ground rules of anonymity to describe private discussions among senior officials at United Nations headquarters over recent days, said the American investigation had also found evidence that up to $3 million in development funds were used by the North Korean government to purchase buildings and houses in Europe and North America. The American ambassador to the United Nations, Zalmay Khalilzad, and his deputy, Mark D.  Wallace, laid out the findings  in recent days in a meeting with Kemal Dervis, administrator of the United Nations Development Program, United Nations officials said. American officials declined to discuss the substance of the meeting, but Richard A. Grenell, the spokesman for the American mission to the United Nations, said,  “We were quite encouraged about how Administrator Dervis came out immediately and committed to investigate the matter.” Details of the United Nations meeting and of alleged abuses regarding development funds for North Korea were first reported in Saturday editions of The Chicago Tribune and The Washington Post. Other abuses alleged in the American inquiry include instances of North Korea using counterfeit bills in currency transactions that were part of United Nations development programs, perhaps aiding money laundering efforts, diplomats said.

A series of promotions bolstered the armed forces’ leading role in the country, as the son and sister of Kim Jong-il were made four-star generals on Tuesday.
==::==
2010-09-29T00:00:00Z
==::==
TOKYO —Kim Jong-il,North Korea’s supreme leader, took new steps on Tuesday to ensure that his family remains in charge after his death, but the biggest leadership shuffling in a generation has so far produced more political intrigue than signs of real change in North Korea, one of the world’s most isolated nations. Mr. Kim elevated his sister and a close friend to a high military ranking and had his youngest son and heir apparent,Kim Jong-un, made a member of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers’ Party. The promotions came a day after the younger Mr. Kim was also made a four-star general and seemed aimed at ensuring a dynastic succession that would give Mr. Kim, thought to be in his late 20s, time to solidify his power. The elevation of the completely unknown Mr. Kim, and hints that other members of the extended Kim clan will exercise power behind the scenes in a kind of Communist regency, add to the uncertainty about North Korea. It appears to have mostly abandoned its incipient economic reforms and has declined to enter new international talks about itsnuclear weaponsprogram, leaving its neighbors and the United States alarmed about its intentions. Few analysts claim to fully understand the inner workings of the North Korean military or the Kim dynasty. But many who watch the country closely say they see few signs that succession will produce a stable, credible leadership that is, at least initially, confident enough to engage with the outside world or to steer resources to economic development rather than the military. “We worry about Pakistan, but this is potentially every bit as destabilizing as Pakistan,” said William R. Keylor, a professor of international relations at Boston University. “Succession in North Korea would just be an oddity if it were not for the fact that we are dealing with a country with nuclear weapons and delivery systems. That is what makes this serious.” Fear of instability also followed the death of Kim Il-sung, North Korea’s founder, and the rise of his son, Kim Jong-il, in 1994. The country did not collapse then, though its economic performance deteriorated sharply and millions of North Koreans are thought to have starved to death during Kim Jong-il’s erratic tenure. This time, the country appears less well prepared for a transition. Kim Jong-il had 14 years between his political introduction in 1980 and his father’s death, time he used to build support internally. There are few signs that a succession process had even begun when Kim Jong-il,  68, apparently suffered a stroke two years ago. Some analysts predict that new leaders may feel compelled to prove their nationalist credentials by engaging in provocative actions that could worsen tensions with South Korea and Japan and their main ally, the United States. In March, South Korea accused the North of sinking one of its warships, theCheonan, which some analysts say appears to have been a display of force meant to persuade the military to respect the younger Mr. Kim. “The question now is whether they will do dangerous things like the Cheonan or something else to hold the regime together,” said Victor Cha, director of Asian studies at Georgetown University. “They were already unstable as it was, and this succession issue makes them even more unpredictable.” In the most destabilizing situation, an internal power struggle could also lead to the collapse of the government. But many observers discount that possibility, largely because of the support of another neighbor, China. Beijing has made it clear that it is determined to avoid a political eruption on its borders. It has consistently taken steps to aid North Korea when the North has had severe shortages of food and energy, and it has tried to ensure that international sanctions intended to punish the North for its development of nuclear weapons are not crippling. Kim Jong-il has made two visits to China in recent months to shore up its support. China has said that the younger Mr. Kim was not a member of his father’s delegation in China a month ago, but American officials say they believe the son indeed was on the trip and may have met Chinese officials informally. “What China is most concerned about is stability, namely stability in North Korea, the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia,” said Xu Wenji, an expert on North Korea at the Northeast Asia Institute at Jilin University. “So the concern for stability overrides everything else on this matter for the Chinese government.” The reasons behind the elevation of Kim Jong-il’s sister, Kim Kyong-hui, and Choe Ryong-hae, a lifelong friend of the Korean leader and a member of his inner circle, along with the promotion of Kim Jong-un, are uncertain. Experts suggested that the three, along with the sister’s husband, Jang Song-taek, might end up forming a new ruling group that could have the power to keep the military in check and continue the  dynasty, at least until the son can fully replace his father. The promotion of the sister caught some analysts by surprise. Mr. Cha at Georgetown said it represented public recognition for someone who was already the power behind the throne in the Kim dynasty. He said that she was the confidante and the woman closest to Kim Jong-il, whose wives and mother are dead, and that she even took care of the leader when he was ill. “They are very, very close,” said Choi Jin-wook, a scholar at the Korea National Institute for Unification in Seoul, who said Ms. Kim was likely to emerge as “the key person in the new collective leadership of the country.” He noted that she never really needed a defined political role in North Korea “because she was the sister of the king and she had all the power she needed — maybe too much.” Mr. Choi said Ms. Kim, 64, was rumored to have a drinking problem and a fiery temper. Her daughter committed suicide in France in 2006. She is the wife of Jang Song-taek, often regarded by  analysts as the No. 2 man in the North. Kim Jong-il has relied on him to handle the day-to-day duties of running the country. There were hints that some moderates have also gained power. Kang Sok-ju, a deputy foreign minister, was named deputy premier, and Kim Kye-gwan, the North’s chief negotiator in the six-nation nuclear talks, took Mr. Kang’s slot. Another negotiator, Ri Yong-ho, also moved up. American officials said they had not seen enough to predict with confidence how the succession would affect the North’s actions and policies. Kurt M. Campbell, an assistant secretary of state, told reporters in New York on Monday that the United States was “watching developments in North Korea carefully.” “But frankly,” he said, “it’s still too early to tell in terms of next steps, or in fact, what’s going on inside the country’s leadership.” Koreas Plan Talks SEOUL, South Korea — An official with the Ministry of National Defense here said Wednesday that the two Koreas would hold military talks on Thursday morning at the border village of Panmunjom. The two sides have not held such talks in two years. The defense official, speaking anonymously, declined to discuss the agenda of the working-level talks. But it was widely expected that Seoul would raise the issue of the sinking of a South Korean warship in March. The South has blamed a North Korean torpedo attack for the sinking.

North Korea’s leader is to convene a ruling party meeting where it is expected that his son will be given an official post, a step on the road to leadership.

==::==
SEOUL, South Korea —Kim Jong-il, the North Korean leader, is expected to convene a rare congress of the ruling Workers’ Party in coming days to pave the way for his son to succeed him, a feat of political engineering that would be a first in the Communist world: extending dynastic rule to a third generation. Ahead of the national congress, the first ceremonial conclave of the party’s delegates in decades, Mr. Kim’s propaganda machine is busily reminding North Koreans that their nation owes it existence to Mr. Kim’s father, Kim Il-sung, who was a leader of anti-Japanese guerrillas in Manchuria in the early 20th century. The meeting, like all political events in the North, will be secret, and even the precise starting date has not been publicly confirmed.North Koreahas said that the party’s “highest leading body” will be elected at the meeting; beyond that, the agenda is unknown, and it is unclear how the expected promotion of Mr. Kim’s third son,Kim Jong-un, will be presented. But Mr. Kim’s recent trip to China, North Korea’s main patron and supporter, which followed the announcement of the meeting, has fueled speculation that a momentous transition is under way. “This party meeting will be a coming-out party for Kim Jong-un,” said Peter Beck, a North Korea expert at Keio University in Japan. Little is known about the son, believed to be in his late 20s, and no photos or public sightings of him have been reported since he attended a Swiss school as a teenager. After his father’s stroke in 2008, however, his grooming as heir picked up speed. He has accompanied Mr. Kim on visits to factories and military units and is getting policy briefings, according to South Korean intelligence officials who monitor developments in the North. Songs, poems and posters alluding to the son are in circulation, they say. North Korean media have not mentioned the son by name, but propaganda has hinted about the virtues of transferring power to a younger generation. Kim Jong-il, who took over when his father died in 1994, began building his “military first” leadership platform 50 years ago as a teenager, official media say. Under Mr. Kim’s military-oriented rule, the Workers’ Party has withered. The last time the party held its congress, a 1980 meeting during which Mr. Kim sealed his position as successor by assuming crucial party posts, the party’s Politburo had 34 members. Now it has only eight, as those who have died have not been replaced. “A new force will come in who will pave the way for the succession and support the young, inexperienced kid as leader,” said Chang Yong-seok, research director at the Institute for Peace Affairs in Seoul. “If a new generation of leaders comes in, this is not a bad thing. They could be less bound by ideology and more pragmatic about opening up.” Historically, the Kim family has used party caucuses to purge political enemies, as well as proclaim long-term visions for the country. Recently, there has been an unusually large number of reports about top-ranking North Korean officials being executed, killed in mysterious traffic accidents or declared missing. Jang Song-taek, Mr. Kim’s brother-in-law, and hard-line generals on Mr. Kim’s National Defense Commission, the country’s top ruling body, are expected to move into crucial party posts to ensure a smooth transition of power, analysts say. Less clear is whether Mr. Kim is confident enough to place his son in the Politburo and the party’s Central Military Commission. Woo Seong-ji, a professor at Kyung Hee University in Seoul, said that he believed Mr. Kim might start his son in a rather modest post to “lessen the shock” and buy time to build his leadership credentials. Mr. Beck of Keio University said: “He can’t be too prominent because he is not known to the North Korean public. They have to make the sale to the public. But they have to make the sale to some of the elite, too.” It is unclear what other changes might be on the agenda. During his meeting with Mr. Kim in Changchun, in northeastern China, last Friday, President Hu Jintao urged North Korea to follow China’s example by adopting a “market mechanism,” according to Chinese media. Mr. Kim toured factories and expressed interest in how China had sought to reinvigorate a region just across the North Korean border. Faced with international sanctions, Mr. Kim may view stronger economic ties with China as one blueprint he can offer at the party congress, said Jin Jingyi, a North Korea expert at Peking University. The North Korean government survived the first health scare set off by Mr. Kim’s stroke without much instability. That showed that Mr. Kim’s inner circle, whose political fortunes rest with the Kim family’s dynastic rule, would be likely to ensure a smooth transfer of power to the son even if Mr. Kim suddenly died, analysts said. “I think he is chosen exactly because he is young,” said Andrei Lankov, a North Korea expert at Kookmin University in Seoul. “In case of his father’s sudden death, Kim Jong-un — inexperienced, without power base, embarrassingly young — will have no choice but to obediently follow the instructions of the old guard. He will be a dictator, but merely a rubber-stamping dictator. This is what the people in the position of power want.”

SEOUL, South Korea —North Korea’s rubber-stamp  legislature convened Friday in the capital, Pyongyang, offering few hints of a major policy shift despite a growing desperation for economic recovery. The country’s ailing leader, Kim Jong-il, did not show up at the Supreme People’s Assembly, igniting speculation about his health and whereabouts. His absence from  the assembly, although not unusual, followed some unconfirmed news reports in South Korea in the past week that he might already have embarked on a clandestine trip to China to win needed aid. South Korean officials questioned those reports, though they had earlier predicted that he might soon visit China, the North’s last remaining major ally. Outside analysts have been closely monitoring Mr. Kim’s absences or appearances in major state affairs sincehis 2008 strokefueled speculation on how long he could stay in power. Mr. Kim, 68, is now struggling with North Korea’s deepening economic woes while preparing to hand over power to a son. On Friday, the  legislative session adopted a second constitutional revision in a year, the country’s state-run news agency, KCNA, reported without providing details. The South Korean news agency Yonhap speculated that the amendment might be intended to help the transfer of power from Mr. Kim to his third son,Kim Jong-un, 27. Others doubted it. “I think it may have more to do with the economy or a minor readjustment of the Constitution,” said Kim Yong-hyun, a North Korea expert at Dongguk University in Seoul. The gatherings of legislators in the North provide outside officials and analysts with a rare opportunity to seek clues to North Korean policies and any changes in its leadership hierarchy. Kim Jong-il, who is also a legislator, has often skipped the sessions. But he used the meeting last year to demonstrate that he was still in charge despite having suffered a stroke in 2008. After months of being out of sight, he entered the parliamentary hall to the thunderous applause of loyal members, though he looked gaunt and limped slightly. At the time, the assembly approved the first constitutional revision in 11 years to make one of Mr. Kim’s several official titles — chairman of the National Defense Commission — the supreme ruling post in North Korea. The move reconfirmed his already absolute grip on power. Analysts had said that the session this year was most likely to focus on reviving North Korea’s moribund economy, a goal the nation had set at the start of the year. On Friday, KCNA reported that the session passed a budget for the year that promised a 10.1 percent increase in spending for consumer goods industries and a 9.4 percent increase for agriculture. North Korean reports on Friday’s session made no reference to the country’s tricky relations with South Korea and the United States. But the country’s Foreign Ministry reiterated that the North would continue to build and modernize nuclear weapons. An unidentified spokesman of the ministry told KCNA that North Korea was willing to “denuclearize the Korean Peninsula” — but only if the United States abandoned its “hostile policy” toward the North.

SEOUL, South Korea — The mystery of what caused a South Korean warship to sink in disputed waters may not be solved for days, with rescuers still hunting for 46 missing sailors, and a recovery crane slowly being moved to the site. The South Korean military announced on Tuesday that one of the divers taking part in the rescue effort had died, The Associated Press reported. In the meantime, the political pressure will remain high on the South Korean government, which has been unable to offer a convincing explanation for the explosion that broke up the 1,200-ton ship, the Cheonan, within minutes late Friday night. South Korean officials, while careful not to point directly atNorth Korea, allowed speculation regarding its culpability to rage, speaking volumes about South Korea’s current state of uneasiness with the North. “The government or our Defense Ministry has never said it ruled out the possibility of North Korean involvement,” Defense Minister Kim Tae-young of South Korea said Monday during a grilling in Parliament. Asked about mines, Mr. Kim said that it was “possible” that the Cheonan was hit by one of thousands of mines North Korea deployed near its coasts during the Korean War, from 1950 to 1953. He also kept open the possibility that a North Korean submarine might have launched a torpedo, an initial focus of suspicion. North Korea has used difficult-to-detect submersibles to insert spies into the South. Other theories mentioned at Parliament and in domestic media included an on-board saboteur and something exploding inside the warship, which reportedly carried torpedoes, depth charges, missiles and other weaponry. The two Koreas remain technically at war, since the Korean War ended only in a truce. But relations, relatively warm for years, have grown ever more tendentious with the North’s confrontational stance on itsnuclear weaponsprogram and the South’s election of President Lee Myung-bak, who took office in 2008 with a hard line against the North. The fragility of peace on the divided Korean Peninsula is most evident along the disputed western maritime border in the Yellow Sea, where the two navies fought skirmishes in 1999 and 2002 and briefly exchanged fire again last November. North Korea has repeatedly warned of a “clash” and “retaliation” in these waters. On Monday, the North kept silent on the sinking of the South Korean ship, but its state-run news media criticized the United States and South Korea over their annual joint military exercise, calling them “war maniacs running amok to prepare an invasion of the North.” It also warned of a “loss of lives” if the United States and South Korea did not stop allowing journalists inside the heavily armed buffer zone separating the two Koreas. Mr. Kim suggested that North Korea was silent on the Cheonan “either because it did something and wanted to hide it, or because it didn’t want to cause any misunderstanding, or because it sought to maximize” South Koreans’ speculation and fear of North Korean provocation. Navy divers, battling a rapid current and poor visibility, reached the sunken rear half of the ship 132 feet down on Monday, but received no response after rapping it with hammers, said Lee Ki-shik, a navy brigadier general. Fifty-eight sailors were rescued in the hours after the explosion, but none have been found since, alive or dead. Any navy crewmen who initially survived and managed to seal themselves inside watertight cabins would most likely have run out of air by Monday night. Military officials estimated that the supply of oxygen in the cabins would last only up to 69 hours. South Korea’s military has often been accused of whitewashing investigations into soldiers’ deaths, adding complexity to the Cheonan mystery. The sinking is South Korea’s worst peacetime naval disaster since a navy landing ship capsized off the south coast in stormy weather in 1974, killing 159 sailors and coast guard personnel. It is also the largest disaster to hit South Korea since President Lee took office. His ruling party will face crucial mayoral and gubernatorial elections in June.

A public health project is said to represent “an unprecedented level of cooperation” between doctors from the United States and North Korea.
==::==
2010-03-02T00:00:00Z
==::==
With help from scientists fromStanford University’s medical school,North Koreahas developed its first laboratory capable of detecting drug-resistant tuberculosis, scientists involved in the project said last week. Tuberculosis surged in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea during the famines of the 1990s. (Starvation suppresses the immune system, allowing latent infections to grow.) But the country cannot tell which cases are susceptible to whichantibiotics, meaning more dangerous strains could push out strains that are easier to kill, as has happened in Russia and Peru. The project began after John W. Lewis, an expert on Chinese politics at Stanford participating in informal diplomatic talks over North Korea’s nuclear threat, realized how serious aTBproblem the country had. In 2008, doctors from North Korea’s health ministry visited experts in the San Francisco Bay area. Last month, a Stanford team began installing the new diagnostics lab at a hospital in the capital, Pyongyang. The project “represents an unprecedented level of cooperation” between North Korean and American doctors, Professor Lewis said. It is  supported by theNuclear Threat Initiative, a nonprofit global security group led by former Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, and byChristian Friends of Korea, a humanitarian group. Although it will soon be able to grow and test TB strains, North Korea right now has none of the more expensive    antibiotics that attack drug-resistant TB, said Sharon Perry, the epidemiologist leading the Stanford team. Without outside help it will also run out of routine first-line antibiotics by July, she said.

More news outlets have emerged in recent years specializing in collecting information from the North.

SEOUL — For a journalist who helped break one of the biggest stories out of North Korea in the past year, Mun Seong-hwi keeps an extremely low profile. The name he offers is an alias. He does not reveal what he did in North Korea before his defection in 2006, aside from mention of a “desk job,” in order to protect relatives left behind. He also maintains a wall of secrecy around his three “underground stringers” in North Korea, who he says do not know he works for Daily NK, an Internet news service based in Seoul and reviled by Pyongyang. On Nov. 30, quoting Mr. Mun’s and other anonymous “sources inside North Korea,” Daily NK reported that, starting that day, the North Korean government would radically devalue its currency, requiring people to exchange their old bank notes for new at a rate of 100 to 1. Furthermore, there would be limit on how much of this old money people could turn in for new. The report, which made headlines around the world and was later confirmed by South Korean officials, had far-reaching implications. It meant, among other things, that the North Korean government was cracking down on the country’s nascent free markets, wiping out much of the wealth private entrepreneurs had accumulated by trading goods at a time when the Communist government’s ration system was failing to meet its people’s basic needs. “I take pride in my work,” Mr. Mun, a man in his early 40s with brooding eyes and a receding hairline, said in an interview. “I help the outside world see North Korea as it is.” Daily NK is one of six news outlets that have emerged in recent years specializing in collecting information from North Korea. These Web sites or newsletters hire North Korean defectors and cultivate sources inside a country shrouded in a near-total news blackout. While North Korea shutters itself from the outside — it blocks the Internet, jams foreign radio broadcasts and monitors international calls — it releases propaganda-filled dispatches through the government’s mouthpiece, the Korean Central News Agency. But, thanks to Daily NK and the other services, it is also possible now for outsiders to read a dizzying array of “heard-in-North Korea” reports, many on topics off limits for public discussion in the North, like the health of the country’s leader, Kim Jong-il. The reports are sketchy at best, covering small pockets of North Korea society. Many prove wrong, contradict each other or remain unconfirmed. But they have also produced important scoops, like the currency devaluation and a recent outbreak of swine flu in North Korea. The mainstream media in South Korea now regularly quote these cottage-industry news services. “Technology made this possible,” said Sohn Kwang-joo, the chief editor of Daily NK. “We infiltrate the wall of North Korea with cellphones.” Over the past decade, the North’s border with China has grown more porous as famine drove many North Koreans out in search of food and an increasing traffic in goods — and information — developed. A new tribe of North Korean merchants negotiates smuggling deals with Chinese partners, using Chinese cellphones that pick up signals inside the North Korean border. These phones have become a main tool of communication for many of the 17,000 North Korean defectors living in the South trying to re-establish contact with their families and friends in the North. Mr. Sohn, a former reporter with the mainstream daily newspaper Dong-A in Seoul, has South Korean “correspondents” near the China-North Korea border. These volunteers, many of them pro-democracy advocates during their student years, secretly meet North Koreans traveling across the border and recruit underground stringers. The volunteers use business visas, or sometimes pretend to be students or tourists. “It’s dangerous work, and it takes one or two years to recruit one,” Mr. Sohn said. In the past year, the quality of the information these news services provide has improved as they have hired more North Korean intellectuals and former officials who defected to the South and still have friends in elite circles in the North, said Ha Tae-keung, a former student activist who runs Open Radio for North Korea and a Web site. “These officials provide news because they feel uncertain about the future of their regime and want to have a link with the outside world, or because of their friendship with the defectors working for us, or because of money,” said Mr. Ha, who also goes by his English name, Young Howard. All these news outlets pay their informants. Mr. Ha pays a bonus for significant scoops. Daily NK and Open Radio each have 15 staff members, some of them defectors, and receive U.S. congressional funding through the National Endowment for Democracy, as well as support from other public and private sources. Recently, they have been receiving tips from North Koreans about corrupt officials. “The fact that news comes out through civic groups like ours means that North Korean society is changing fast,” said Pomnyun Sumin, a Buddhist monk and chairman of Good Friends, a relief group based in Seoul whose newsletter broke the swine flu story last month. Some informants have become so  adept with technology that they send text-messages, audio files and photos to Seoul by cell phone, said Kim Heung-gwang, a former North Korean computer scientist who heads North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity, a group of defectors that runs a news Web site. Bringing news out of North Korea is risky. Mr. Kim said that one of his informants was stopped last May while trying to smuggle out a video in a small camera hidden in a cosmetics bottle. She is believed to have killed herself in police detention, he said. “You wonder whether they should let their sources take such risks,” Chang Yong-hoon, who covers North Korea for the mainstream news agency Yonhap, said at a recent forum on the news services. “They’ve produced as many erroneous reports as they have real scoops.” Kang Chol-hwan, a former North Korean prison camp inmate who now writes for the mainstream daily Chosun, said there are “information brokers” in North Korea who sell exaggerated and fake news to outside media. Lee Chan-ho, a chief analyst at the South Korean government’s Unification Ministry, warned that the “flood of raw, unconfirmed reports” complicates the effort to understand the North. Mr. Ha, of Open Radio for North Korea, conceded that point: “Because our sources have never been trained in journalism, exaggeration is a problem for us. Some demand more money for information. We try to cross-check our reports as much as possible.” Mr. Mun of Daily NK sends his stringers 1,000 Chinese renminbi, or about $150, every two or three months. They call him once a week at a designated time. They find a place where they feel safe from the North Korean police patrolling with equipment that detects cell phone users, and dial. In Seoul, Mr. Mun hears the ring tone, then calls back and talks for about half an hour. After the call, his stringers hang up and hide their phones until the next call. Recently, with so many developments in the North, they have been calling him at unscheduled times, for instance, when he was in the subway. “I have to rush off and call back quickly,” Mr. Mun said. “If I don’t within five minutes, he’ll turn off and I’ll lose him.” There is another strict rule. “We don’t know, and never ask, each other’s real name,” Mr. Mun said. “That’s safer for them. Their safety is my biggest concern.”

In August,my mother and I found ourselves in North Korea, where she and my father were born. My father had flown all the way to China in two failed attempts to see it again before he died. So when students at my university were able to procure the ever-elusive visas and take a group there, despite the news about nuclear testing and American journalists disappearing into the “most dangerous place on earth,” we felt we had to go. From the roof of the Pyongyang airport a smiling portrait of Kim Il-sung, beloved “Eternal President” (dead since 1994), greeted us. But as we set foot on the tarmac, shimmering in the insane Asian heat, our group was on high alert. We were aware that no U.S. embassy or consulate could help us out if we ran into trouble. We knew what we couldn’t bring (cellphones, religious items, books about North Korea, notebooks), and we knew that the secret police might be bugging our rooms. We cracked weak jokes, wondering if Bill Clinton, who just days before came to secure the release of the two journalists, would need to be called back. We sweltered through customs at the hands of men in gray Mao suits and women in neutral “Mad-Men”-era outfits, every heart topped by a pin of Kim Il-sung. Then over the next few days we were shown carefully presented slices of Pyongyang: the subway, for example, which we rode for a single stop, where elaborate murals of a workers’ paradise were lighted by chandeliers. We went to endless museums and parks but were sternly instructed not to speak to any locals. We took meals at restaurants where we were the only customers, and the food seemed to come from the same Western-facsimile kitchen: bread with swirls, bland fried flounder, mayonnaise-based salad served in a martini glass. Finally my mother, weary of the utter weirdness of the place, told our tour guide in Korean that we needed to try some real North Korean food. It was indeed announced one day that for lunch we would have a traditional clam bulgogi, clam barbecue. The bus took us to a gorgeous area in the mountains, complete with a waterfall and a tranquil pool. People were already there having their own picnic on the sandy beach. Our picnic was set up on a rocky ledge on the other side, but the water was irresistible in the heat, and some of us gravitated there. Oddly, our handlers said nothing, even though normally they were alert as sheepdogs to anyone wandering off and earlier in the day an unauthorized photo incident caused upset all around. To get to the beach, you walked a path where a young boy sat painting a picture of the waterfall — it was almost too picturesque. The locals had spread out a feast of kimchi, bulgogi, mounds of fat purple grapes, cold bottles of beer. Soon some of the picnickers were cheerily exhorting us to join them, even picking up food with chopsticks and depositing it straightaway in people’s mouths. Beer was poured; songs were sung. It was the first time I’d seen North Koreans smile wide, toothy grins. After a while the tour guide sauntered over and reminded us that we weren’t supposed to talk to locals. She didn’t sound convinced of her own words. I suddenly started to see everything anew. Why were the picnickers here in the middle of the workday? Why was their food, those perfect pyramids of fruit, untouched before they pulled us over? Even the boy; I peered at his easel as I walked back and saw he was using a kind of paint-by-numbers kit. While we ate our clam bulgogi, burning our fingers on the shells, the picnickers below continued to have the time of their lives, laughing and swimming. Some in our group shared my suspicions: this was a “propaganda picnic” for our benefit, but others insisted these North Koreans just wanted to show their good will. Later, when we were back on the bus, about to leave, Kelly, one of the students, leapt up and exclaimed she’d left her purse at the picnic site. One of our minders, Mr. Lee, walked back with her. No one panicked; we understood that in a collectivist society, people didn’t steal. When they returned, she had her bag, and so we clapped. Then she announced, “My wallet’s gone.” From the bus window I saw Mr. Lee squatting on the ground with his head in his hands, obviously having a very bad day. Later I asked Kelly if our friendly picnickers had still been there, but she said no — in fact they evaporated along with her wallet. We tallied that piece of evidence onto the “propaganda picnic” side, while the others chided us for being so cynical. Either way, it felt as if we’d finally seen a little of the real North Korea.

North Korea’s statement would appear to end a debate within American intelligence agencies about whether the country was working on a second pathway to building nuclear weapons.

WASHINGTON —North Koreadeclared Friday that it was in the “concluding stage” of tests to enrich uranium. Its statement would appear to end a decade-long debate within American intelligence agencies about whether the country was working on a second pathway to buildingnuclear weapons. The statement came in a brief announcement by the official North Korean news agency, quoting what it said was a letter from the North Korean government to the United Nations. No details were offered, and the use of the word “tests” suggests that the country may only be experimenting and has not yet undertaken the huge expense required to install the thousands of centrifuges necessary to produce enough uranium for a nuclear weapon. For the North, the new nuclear program would amount to an insurance policy. For decades it pursued another pathway to a bomb, taking the spent fuel from one of its nuclear reactors and producing plutonium. To prove its capacity, the North has conducted two nuclear tests, one that fizzled in 2006 anda more successful detonation in May. In February 2007, the North agreed todismantle its reactorsand stop producing bomb fuel. But it reversed that commitment this year, and on Friday it said it had harvested the remaining spent fuel, which could provide it with enough plutonium for one or two additional weapons. North Korea was believed to already have enough plutonium for about six to eight nuclear weapons. But the existence of a second program to build bomb fuel would give the country something else to negotiate over with the West, and it would create the possibility that the government of Kim Jong-il could try to sell the technology, just as it has sold some of its reactor technology. North Korean officials announced in April that they intended tostart a uranium enrichment program. In its brief statement on Friday, the country also hinted at resuming negotiations, saying, “We are prepared for both sanctions and dialogue.” In Beijing on Friday, the United States’ special envoy for North Korea, Stephen Bosworth, commented on the North’s claim, Reuters reported. Speaking to reporters, he said: “Obviously, anything that the North is doing in the area of nuclear development is of concern to us.” In the fall of 2002, aides to President George W. Bush accused the North of seeking to enrich uranium. North Korean officials first seemed to admit proudly to a covert enrichment program, but they later denied it. Mr. Bush used the episode to refuse to negotiate with North Korea and terminated a 1994 agreement on freezing nuclear operations. But in the aftermath of the failure to find unconventional weapons in Iraq, American intelligence agencies began to lose confidence in their assessment of North Korea’s nuclear capacity. During a Congressional hearing in 2007, Joseph DeTrani, one of the government’s senior North Korea intelligence experts, said thatthe intelligence community was assured only at “midconfidence level”that the North Koreans were involved in a uranium enrichment program. If the North Koreans have only recently conducted tests in uranium enrichment, as their letter stated, it may suggest that the program has been in abeyance and has been resumed for negotiating purposes. The North may also now see enrichment as a cheaper alternative to restarting decrepit nuclear reactors to produce plutonium.

Bill Clinton’s visit gave the Obama administration its first detailed look into a regime that looms as a major threat.
==::==
2009-08-19T00:00:00Z
==::==
WASHINGTON — The visit was arranged under a veil of secrecy with the help of an unlikely broker: a high-level American intelligence officer who spent much of his career trying to unlock the mysteries ofNorth Korea. When former PresidentBill Clintonlanded in Pyongyang on Aug. 4 to win the release of two imprisoned American journalists, senior officials said he met an unexpectedly spry North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, who welcomed him with a long dinner that night, even proposing to stay up afterward. Mr. Kim was flanked by two longtime aides, and he gave no hint that North Korea was in the throes of a succession struggle, despite the widespread questions over how long he might live. Mr. Clinton and the Obama administration were determined not to extend a public-relations coup to Mr. Kim, who expressed a desire for better relations with the United States. But the visit is already setting off ripples that could change the tenor of the relationship between the United States and North Korea. On Wednesday, diplomats from North Korea plan to visit Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico with an undisclosed agenda, a senior administration official said Tuesday. Like Mr. Clinton, Mr. Richardson has traveled to Pyongyang to negotiate the release of Americans held there, in his case in the mid-1990s. The White House approved the visit, which the official said did not signal any movement toward the resumption of official talks with North Korea and the United States. But the meeting, which he said the North Koreans requested, comes on the heels of conciliatory gestures toward South Korea, and suggests a concerted effort on the part of the North. Mr. Clinton steered clear of broader issues during his humanitarian mission, officials said. Indeed, he did not even ask to see Mr. Kim, requesting instead a meeting with “an appropriate official.” To help the former president in case something went awry, the White House recommended John Podesta, an adviser to both Mr. Clinton and President Obama, join his delegation. And to ensure he would not leave empty-handed, Mr. Clinton asked that a member of his entourage meet with the journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, shortly after he landed to make sure they were safe, said a senior administration official, who had been briefed on the visit. For all the billions of dollars a year that the United States spends on intelligence gathering about mysterious and unpredictable countries like North Korea, it took just 20 hours on the ground in Pyongyang by a former president to give the Obama administration its first detailed look into a nuclear-armed nation that looms as one of its greatest foreign threats. The details about Mr. Clinton’s visit came from interviews with multiple government officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. On Tuesday, Mr. Clinton went to the White House to brief Mr. Obama and his top aides about the trip. Even before the 40-minute session in the Situation Room, Mr. Clinton had spoken to the president by phone and briefed his national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones. But the meeting was rich in symbolism, and the president invited Mr. Clinton to the Oval Office to talk further. The White House said little about what the men discussed, beyond noting that Mr. Obama had wanted to thank Mr. Clinton for winning the release of Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee. The role of the intelligence officer, Joseph R. DeTrani, in arranging the visit, has not previously been reported. Mr. DeTrani is the government’s senior officer responsible for collecting and analyzing intelligence on North Korea. His efforts to pave the way for Mr. Clinton’s visit offer a glimpse into how the administration has been forced to use unorthodox methods to overcome the lack of formal communications. During the Bush administration, when the United States was in still in talks with North Korea, the White House did not use intelligence officers for these purposes, an official familiar with the talks said. Indeed, before taking the job of North Korea mission manager in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in 2006, Mr. DeTrani served as the special envoy to the six-party talks with North Korea. More than anything else, senior officials said, Mr. Clinton’s visit served to clear up some of the shadows surrounding Kim Jong-il’s health. After suffering a stroke last year, he looked frail in photos, spurring questions about who might replace him. Those questions have not gone away, officials said, but they may recede a bit after Mr. Clinton’s visit. So, too, may the speculation about internal battles, given the apparent good standing of Kim Kye-gwan, the chief nuclear negotiator, and another foreign policy official, Kang Sok-ju, who also took part in the meetings. The former president did not engage in a substantive discussion aboutNorth Korea’s nuclear program. Nor did the North Korean leader give Mr. Clinton any indication that his nation would relinquish its nuclear ambitions — a condition the United States has set for resuming negotiations, officials said. During his one-hour meeting, officials said, Mr. Clinton advised the North Korean that he could win favor with South Korea and Japan by resolving cases of their citizens who had been abducted by North Korea. The dinner, which lasted over two hours, was “chitchat,” the official said. “It was not substantive.” North Korea has sent other conciliatory signals. Kim Jong-il met last week with the head of a South Korean conglomerate and agreed to restart several tourism ventures, which allow people from the South to visit the North. North Korea said it would also allow reunions of Korean families divided by the border. Also, Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, said Wednesday the North would send a delegation to the funeral of Kim Dae-jung, a former president of the South. It is not clear whether the overtures represent a change of heart or a growing desperation for money, as the North comes under increasingly strict United Nations sanctions. The White House says it is determined not to ease the pressure. In a deliberate bit of timing, it dispatched a senior diplomat, Philip S. Goldberg, to Asia on Tuesday to discuss ways to enforce the sanctions. Still, officials and analysts said, Mr. Clinton’s visit was valuable, largely because North Korea is so opaque. Victor Cha, a top North Korea adviser in the Bush administration, said, “The Clinton trip has got a lot of people rethinking and reassessing.”

Two American journalists who have been held in North Korea on charges of illegal entry and “hostile” acts were scheduled to go on trial on Thursday.

SEOUL — Two American journalists were scheduled to go on trial on Thursday in a case that is widely seen as a test of how far the isolated Communist state was willing to take its confrontational stance toward the United States. The two Americans, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, have been held inNorth Koreafor two and one-half months on charges of illegal entry and “hostile” acts. If they are convicted on such charges under the Communist state’s criminal code, the two journalists could be sentenced to  five years of hard labor or more at the country’s infamous prison camps. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has called the charges “baseless.” Washington reiterated on Wednesday that the North should forgo the legal proceedings and release the two women. In a brief dispatch early Thursday, the North’s official news organ, the Korean Central News Agency,  said that the trial would begin at 3 p.m. (2 a.m. Eastern time on Thursday) in Pyongyang Central Court, the highest court of North Korea. But by Thursday evening, there was no word on whether the trial had begun. Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee were on a reporting assignment from Current TV, a San Francisco-based media company co-founded by Al Gore, the former vice president, when they were detained by North Korean soldiers on the border between North Korea and China on March 17. The reporters were working on a report about North Korean refugees — women and children — who had fled their impoverished country in hopes of finding food in China. The circumstances surrounding the detention of the two journalists remain unclear. Analysts said they became a pawn in a rapidly deteriorating confrontation between the United States and North Korea —  a potential bargaining chip for the Pyongyang regime and a handicap for Washington in its efforts to pressure the regime over its recent missile and nuclear tests. The reporters’ families pleaded for clemency. “All we can do is hope the North Korean government will show leniency,” Lisa Ling, Ms. Ling’s older sister who is herself a television journalist, in an emotional plea at a California vigil Wednesday night, The Associated Press reported. “If at any point they committed a transgression, then our families are deeply, deeply sorry. We know the girls are sorry as well.” Lisa Ling said that North Korean officials permitted her sister to call her last Tuesday night, roughly two days after its nuclear test. “She said that the only way she may be able to get released is if our two countries communicate,” Lisa Ling told Larry King of CNN on Monday, describing the four-minute telephone conversation she had with her sister. “She sounds absolutely terrified.” Defying not only its traditional foes — the United States, Japan and South Korea — but also its longtime ideological allies, China and Russia, North Korea launched an intermediate-range rocket on April 5 and conducted an underground nuclear test on May 25. Washington is leading an effort at the United Nations Security Council to impose tough sanctions on the North, which the Pyongyang government said it would consider an act of war.

Kim Jong-un, considered a likely successor to his father, the ailing leader Kim Jong-il, was given a low-ranking job at the National Defense Commission, a South Korean news report said.

==::==
SEOUL — The youngest son of the ailing North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, has begun an apprenticeship in the country’s most powerful governing agency, a South Korean news report said. Kim Jong-un, in his mid-20s and lately considered by many analysts in Seoul as a likely successor to his father, was recently given a low-ranking job at the National Defense Commission, according to Yonhap, a South Korean news agency, quoting anonymous sources in its report. Yonhap saw the move as an indication that an active grooming of the son as the next leader has begun. His father was similarly prepared decades ago by assuming low-level jobs with the ruling Workers Party of Korea. Mr. Kim took over the North Korean helm when his father, President Kim Il-sung, died in 1994. Like most news  about the inner workings of the Kim family, the latest report could not be independently confirmed. South Korean media often carry conflicting reports about the Kim family. Yonhap had earlier reported that Kim Jong-un would be elected to the rubber-stamp Parliament in March as a way to speed up his apprenticeship. That didn’t happen. Media reports about Mr. Kim’s three known sons, especially about Jung-un, have spiked in recent weeks. Mr. Kim, who reportedly suffered a stroke in August, is said to be focusing now on securing a   succession of power for one of his sons. Earlier this month, the  Parliament re-elected Mr. Kim as chairman of the powerful National Defense Commission. Two of his most trusted aides — Oh Geung-nyeol, a general, and Jang Seong-taek, Mr. Kim’s brother-in-law — also were elected to the commission. The appointments of Mr. Oh and Mr. Jang have led to reports about their possible roles in choosing Mr. Kim’s successor, or in one of them becoming the leader himself in the post-Kim era. But those reports, too, were based mostly on conjecture by outside analysts. Experts often vary widely in their theories about Mr. Kim’s motives. Only a few years ago, many analysts, as well as news outlets in South Korea, had dismissed Mr. Jang, believing him to be persona non grata in the regime because he had suddenly disappeared from the public scene. But about a year ago, he returned to politics. Meanwhile, little is known about Mr. Kim’s youngest son. Officials and analysts believe he was born in late 1983 or early 1984. He reportedly liked basketball and looked and acted like his father. As a teenager, he studied at the International School of Berne in Switzerland. Mr. Kim has three known sons by two women. The oldest, Kim Jong-nam, 37, was once considered the undisputed successor. But he reportedly fell out of his father’s favor when he was caught sneaking into Japan on a fake Dominican Republic passport in 2001. He told Japanese authorities that he had planned to visit Tokyo’s Disney resort. After Kim Jung-nam’s apparent disgrace, the middle son, Kim Jong-chol, 27, was cited as a favorite candidate for several years. Mr. Kim’s former Japanese sushi chef, Kenji Fujimoto, said in his memoir that the leader considers his second son “girlish.” And recent South Korean and Japanese news reports have said that he is chronically ill.

TheUnited Nations Security Councildecided unanimously on Monday to tighten sanctions againstNorth Koreaa notch in response to its rocket launching on April 5. The Council  condemned North Korea for violating a 2006 resolution banning it from developing ballistic missiles, and demanded that it cease any further launchings. North Korea responded Tuesday that it would now restore the nuclear facilities it had been disabling and would boycott the stalled six-nation talks aimed at dismantling itsnuclear weaponsprogram “We have no choice but to further strengthen our nuclear deterrent to cope with additional military threats by hostile forces,” the North Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement, according to The Associated Press. The existing sanctions, approved three years ago, had been shelved in favor of  talks to dismantle the country’s nuclear program. The new Security Council statement endorsed those talks, but diplomats said sanctions against  government entities involved in the missile or nuclear program would be enforced and a list of banned goods updated by the end of April.

Escalating its anti-foreign vitriol, North Korea threatened to shoot down U.S. military planes it said were spying on the site of its impending rocket launch.

SEOUL, South Korea — Escalating its anti-foreign vitriol,North Koreathreatened on Wednesday to shoot down American military planes it said were spying on the site of its impending rocket launching. In mid-March, North Korea’s regime announced that it would launch a satellite into orbit between Saturday and next Wednesday. Since then, it has warned that any attempt to interrupt the launching will be considered an act of war. “If the brigandish U.S. imperialists dare to infiltrate spy planes into our airspace to interfere with our peaceful satellite launch preparations, our revolutionary armed forces will mercilessly shoot them down,” the North’s state-run Korea Central Radio said. The broadcast accused the United States of deploying RC-135 surveillance aircraft to spy on theMusudan-ri launch sitenear the North’s northeast coast. North Korea regularly accuses American surveillance aircraft of intruding into its airspace, a claim the United States military dismisses as propaganda. Its threats to shoot them down reflects the overall tension between the United States and North Korea over the planned rocket launching. The United States, South Korea and Japan say that North Korea is using the launching to test its long-range missile technology, a violation of a 2006United Nationsresolution banning the country from all ballistic missile tests. They warned that if North Korea presses ahead with it, they will seek punishment for the North at the Security Council. As the launching date approached, a growing number of analysts in Seoul who have studied the latest satellite images of the North Korean rocket appeared to believe that the rocket may have been configured to put a satellite into orbit. The rocket appears to have a bulb-shaped tip that gives credence to the North’s claim it will carry a satellite, they said. Whether it is a satellite or missile launching, it violates the United Nations resolution because it uses the same technology, South Korean officials said.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreahas placed a long-range missile on a launching pad before a test that the United States, Japan and South Korea said would violate a United Nations Security Council resolution, a news report said Thursday. Spy satellites detected what looked to be a Taepodong-2 missile in place Tuesday at the Musudan-ri launching site near North Korea’s northeastern coast, saidChosun Ilbo, South Korea’s leading daily newspaper, quoting an unidentified diplomatic source. Once the rocket is installed on the pad, missile experts said, the North Koreans can technically launch it within three or four days — the time needed for the fueling of a three-stage rocket. North Korea has said it would launch a rocket over Japan and the Pacific between April 4 and 8 to deliver an experimental communications satellite into orbit. But Washington, Tokyo and Seoul have said the launching is a cover for testing its Taepodong-2 ballistic missile. Both missions — the satellite and the ballistic missile — use the same rocket technology. Washington has warned that it would seek punishment at the Security Council — probably more sanctions on the already isolated country — if North Korea goes ahead with the launching. And Japan has vowed to press for new sanctions if the rocket is tested. The Security Council adopted a resolution banning it from further nuclear and missile tests after North Korea detonated its first nuclear device in 2006. The North’s defiance is the first major test for President Obama in dealing with Pyongyang. “We intend to raise this violation of the Security Council resolution, if it goes forward, in the U.N.,” said Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday. “This provocative action in violation of the U.N. mandate will not go unnoticed, and there will be consequences.” North Korea countered Thursday that further sanctions would cause it to quit the so-called six-party talks, which have been deadlocked since late last year after North Korea expelled international monitors from Yongbyon, its main plutonium-producing nuclear facility. The United States, South Korea, Japan, China and Russia have been trying for years to persuade North Korea to dismantle itsnuclear weaponsprograms in return for economic aid. Comments from the North’s Foreign Ministry spokesman carried by the official KCNA news agency on Thursday also appeared to indicate that the North was threatening to restart Yongbyon if further sanctions were imposed. “The six-party talks will come to an end,” the comments said, and “all the processes for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” would be “brought back to what used to be before their start and necessary strong measures will be taken.” The nuclear complex in Yongbyon, 62 miles north of Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, is the North’s only known source of weapons-grade plutonium. If North Korea restarts it, it means the end of the most visible achievement the Bush administration had made in dealing with North Korea. Under an agreement with the United States, North Korea blew up the cooling tower of Yonbyon’s nuclear reactor last June and has disabled other parts of the facility, which American officials say has produced enough plutonium for several nuclear bombs. But some key components, including the reactor core, remain intact, and North Korea can also extract more plutonium from thousands of spent nuclear fuel rods it has unloaded from the reactor. If North Korea successfully launches its rocket, it would demonstrate that the North has the technological skills to send up a missile that could travel as far as the western United States. Washington and its allies also consider North Korea’s missile program an additional threat because the North has sold missile technology to the Middle East and is developing nuclear weapons that could potentially be loaded on its missiles. After North Korea detonated its first nuclear device in 2006, the Security Council adopted a resolution banning North Korea from further nuclear and missile tests. Won Tae-je, a spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry, declined to confirm Thursday’s news report, but said a missile test would be “a serious challenge and provocation against the security on the Korean Peninsula and regional stability in Northeast Asia.” A successful launching in the first week of April would also give a timely boost to the domestic reputation of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il. The country’s Parliament is scheduled to convene April 9 to re-elect him. Mr. Kim, 67, was reported to have suffered a stroke last August. His declining heath has raised questions about his grip on power and the future of his regime, within which no clear successor has emerged. Some American officials, including Adm. Timothy Keating, the head of the United States Pacific Command, have said that the United States has the capability to shoot down any North Korean missile heading for American territory. But such an intercept is highly unlikely, according to experts in Seoul, in part because Washington is trying to win the release oftwo Americantelevision journalists recently detained by North Korea. The North has charged them with illegally crossing the Chinese-North Korean border.

President Bush’s prescription for the off-again-on-again North Korea nuclear deal was good; the administration still isn’t following it.
==::==
2008-12-29T00:00:00Z
==::==
President Bush has offered good advice about the off-again-on-again North Korea nuclear deal. The United States, he said recently, must remain “firm and patient” as President-elect Barack Obama assumes the challenge of separating North Korea from its nuclear program. We won’t dwell on the fact that if Mr. Bush had followed that course from the start of his administration, North Korea might not be sitting on enough plutonium for six or more nuclear weapons. His prescription was good; the administration still isn’t following it. Before Mr. Bush spoke, the State Department announced that the United States and its partners would halt deliveries of heavy fuel oil because Pyongyang refused to agree, in writing, on a plan for verifying its nuclear stockpile and facilities. China and Russia insisted that they had not agreed to any such decision. South Korea said it would delay shipping steel plates for North Korean power stations. Japan was already reneging on its commitment to supply fuel aid, and Australia, which had stepped into the breach, announced that it would withhold its contribution. If the shipments stop, North Korea would be within its rights to stop disabling its nuclear facilities at Yongbyon and resume producing plutonium for weapons. That would present Mr. Obama with an immediate crisis. North Korea has a long history of cheating, and robust verification is essential. That includes getting it to commit in writing to allow inspections of key facilities, interviews with scientists and environmental sampling. But under the deal, a verification plan was supposed to come later. The timing was pushed forward as a condition for taking North Korea off the terrorism list by hard-liners seemingly bent on sabotaging the agreement. The deal is premised on action-for-action, including that Washington and its allies provide one million tons of heavy fuel oil in return for North Korea’s disabling the reactor and fuel production facilities at Yongbyon. By one estimate, Pyongyang has completed 85 percent of the disablement while the United States and its partners have delivered no more than 60 percent of the fuel oil. The North Koreans are frustrating, erratic and likely trying to hide nefarious activities. That has always been the challenge. There is much less chance of prying away their nuclear program if this deal falls apart. North Korea missed an opportunity to set a positive tone with the new Obama administration by not signing a formal verification plan now. Its leaders may want to deprive Mr. Bush of a last-minute foreign policy success or may be hoping to force his successor to offer more fuel or other benefits. They shouldn’t count on it. As Mr. Bush suggested, Mr. Obama must be firm and patient as he takes on the challenge of persuading Pyongyang to give up its weapons and stop selling nuclear technology and know-how. He should signal early on that he is sincerely committed to full relations with a nuclear-free Pyongyang and include a North Korean official in a Washington event soon after his inauguration. Mr. Obama also must leave no doubt that he will push the Security Council to impose dormant sanctions — approved after Pyongyang’s 2006 nuclear weapons test — if North Korea walks away from the deal.

PARIS — The North Korean leaderKim Jong-ilhad a stroke in August but appears to be better, according to a French doctor who has treated him. The doctor, François-Xavier Roux,told Le Figaro, the French daily: “Kim Jong-il suffered a stroke but did not undergo an operation. He is now better.” Dr. Roux, a Paris-based neurosurgeon, added: “The photos that have just been published seem recent and authentic to me. I have the impression that he is in charge inNorth Korea. I can’t say more because of medical confidentiality and state secrecy.” United States and South Korean officials have said that Mr. Kim, 66, suffered a stroke in August, raising questions about a possible succession and about who was making decisions onNorth Korea’s nuclear weaponsprogram. The North  has said nothing negative about Mr. Kim’s health and called  reports of his stroke a Western conspiracy to sabotage the government. State media have shown pictures of him at public events, including at a soccer match, looking healthy and smiling. Speculation intensified when Mr. Kim missed a parade on Sept. 9 celebrating the 60th anniversary of the North Korean government. Dr. Roux last treated Mr. Kim in late October, he said. According to Le Figaro, two French doctors, an anesthetist and a surgeon, went to the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, in 1991 and implanted a pacemaker in Mr. Kim.

The U.S. negotiator, Christopher R. Hill, was seeking to keep the North from reactivating its nuclear weapons program.

SEOUL, South Korea —  The chief American negotiator forNorth Koreaarrived in Pyongyang on Wednesday to try to keep the North from reactivating its nuclear weapons program, while a news report said the government may have been restoring a test site. The negotiator, Christopher R. Hill, the United States assistant secretary of state, arrived in the North Korean capital after traveling from Seoul and passing through the heavily fortified border between South and North. His trip is seen as the Bush administration’s last attempt to salvage a nuclear disarmament deal it had struck with the North after years of difficult negotiations. In mid-August, North Korea stopped disabling its main nuclear complex in Yongbyon, 60 miles north of Pyongyang, and began reassembling it. It had warned  the International Atomic Energy Agency that if no further agreement was reached by  Wednesday, it would move “nuclear material” into a plant that can make weapons-grade plutonium out of spent nuclear fuel. Also Wednesday, South Korea’s Defense Ministry announced that the two Koreas would hold military talks at a border village on Thursday. The talks were proposed by North Korea, which has until now shunned official dialogue with the conservative government of President Lee Myung-bak, who took office in February. There also was disturbing yet unconfirmed news Wednesday as the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that smoke had been seen rising recently around the underground nuclear test site at Punggye, in northeast North Korea. North Korea was believed to be incinerating clothing and equipment used to restore the test site, Yonhap reported, quoting an unidentified government source. North Korea detonated a nuclear device in a tunnel there in October 2006. The South Korean government said it could not confirm the report. Aware that its nuclear and missile sites are closely monitored by American spy satellites, North Korea often stages activities there to boost leverage in negotiations, analysts in South Korea said. Although it is renewing activities at the  nuclear complex and banning I.A.E.A. and American nuclear experts from the plutonium-making plant, North Korea still allows them to stay in Yongbyon, where they can observe what it is doing there. That situation — and the fact that North Korea invited Mr. Hill to visit Pyongyang — raised cautious optimism that it was ready for a compromise. But analysts said it was also likely that the North could merely be taking advantage of the American election season while preferring to wait to deal with the new administration in Washington. North Korea reversed its February 2007 agreement to disable Yongbyon after Washington insisted upon a robust nuclear verification mechanism, including visits to undeclared sites and the taking of soil samples, to check whether it was hiding activities — in particular, a suspected uranium enrichment program. North Korea said that such inspections were never part of the disablement deal, in which it said Washington promised to remove it from the list of state sponsors of terrorism once it made a declaration of its nuclear assets. Last June, the North submitted the declaration, but American officials said it left too many questions unanswered. Mr. Hill reportedly carried with him a new proposal in which Washington would remove the North from the terrorism list once it submitted a verification regime not to Washington but to China, which chairs the six-nation disarmament talks. That would save the face for the North. But officials and analysts in Seoul said they were unsure whether it would work. Washington and Pyongyang remained divided over the visits to undeclared nuclear sites and the taking of samples. The reported ill health of Kim Jong-il, the North’s leader, also added uncertainty to Mr. Hill’s efforts to rescue one of President Bush’s legacy issues. On Tuesday, Mr. Hill emphasized that an agreement on verification doesn’t mean that the North would be subject to immediate inspections. “It is not to say that we are going to have anything verified,” he said. “The verification will actually take place later on,  but we need to know what the rules of the road are for verification.” Mr. Hill was expected to return to Seoul as early as Thursday.

For a while, the drumbeat in Washington has been that the North Korean nuclear program is well on its way to being contained. If only that were true.

Vienna, Va. CHINA’S announcement on Saturday that negotiators have agreed on a blueprint for verifying North Korea’s nuclear disarmament is being seen as the latest in a string of hopeful signs. For a while, the drumbeat in Washington has been that the so-called six-party talks are going well and the North Korean nuclear program is well on its way to being contained. If only that were true. In fact, the Kim Jong-il regime is getting exactly what it wants and using American hunger for diplomatic success to split us from our most important regional allies in the process. If this were high-stakes poker, the North Koreans would be biting their lips to hide their smiles at the cards in their hands. As it stands now, we have agreed to ship North Korea a million new tons of fuel oil, released Mr. Kim from the handcuffs of our Trading With the Enemy Act, and — within the legally mandated 45 days — will throw in other goodies that come with removing North Korea from the State Department’s state-sponsor-of-terrorism list. This comes on top of the American decision last year to allow the North Koreans to transfer their tainted money out of a bank in Macao. But the topper is that Kim Jong-il knows he still gets to keep his stockpile of plutonium and even hang on to his existing rack of nuclear weapons (minus the one he tested in October 2006 to set the tone of the game). Nor are the North Koreans going to be required to fess up to the uranium-enrichment program they picked up from Pakistan earlier in the decade. Nor must they explain their role at the suspected nuclear reactor in the Syrian desert that Israeli jets were reported to have destroyed in 2007. And while the North Koreans insist they have changed their ways, The Washington Post reported last month that traces of uranium were found on the very 18,000 pages of documents that North Korea submitted to the Washington in an effort to “come clean” on its programs. Basically, all the North Koreans had to do for these latest concessions was to blow up the cooling tower at the Yongbyon nuclear plant, a publicity stunt for which they billed the United States $2.5 million. Kim Jong-il’s plus-minus sheet looks decidedly better than ours. The ugly truth is that North Korea no longer needed the creaking plutonium apparatus at Yongbyon — it was a liability to them, being visible to American bombers. Knocking down the cooling tower for the news cameras simply took away Washington’s ability to do the same in the dark of night. Far better to have a clandestine uranium enrichment program tucked away, safely underground. Not only will our taking North Korea off the state-sponsored terrorist list strengthen the regime and reward those minimal responses, it is a direct blow to our strongest ally in the region, Japan, which believes it had at least 13 (and possibly dozens more) citizens kidnapped by North Korea in the 1970s and ’80s. Resolving this abductee issue goes to the fundamental integrity of the Japanese government. If the situation were reversed, and Americans were grabbed off a dark Florida beach by a Cuban patrol boat, we would go to war to bring them home. But America has pledged to protect Japan in return for the Japanese forgoing offensive arms. Taking the Japanese abductees off the negotiating table while leaving North Korea with its existing weapons may cause Tokyo to question the utility of that pledge. North Korea’s missiles can’t hit us, but Japan is well within the kill zone. No one should imply that North Korea is an easy nut to crack. Smart folks on both sides of the domestic political aisle have struggled with this challenge. North Korea has shown no intention of giving up its nuclear weapons, and we are unfortunately not in a position to either force or entice it to do so. Despite all the spin out of the talks among the six concerned parties — China, Japan, North Korea, Russia, South Korea and the United States — there is no reason to honestly assume North Korea will ever give up its nuclear capability. But things are not made any better by pretending that we are making progress, as Washington seems to have decided to do, or by ignoring the real concerns of our allies. Our approach to North Korea calls for a lot more honesty and, in the eyes of those with more at risk, a greater dose of sincerity. There is more at stake here than just North Korean bombs.

North Koreasaid it would take no additional steps to dismantle its nuclear program until the United States and other negotiating partners provided all the oil and political benefits promised under an aid-for-disarmament agreement. The North Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it had disabled 80 percent of its main nuclear complex, but that the six countries involved in disarmament talks had made only 40 percent of the energy shipments they had promised. North Korea said it would move to the next phase of the denuclearization process, abandoning and dismantling its nuclear weapons programs, only when it has been awarded all the energy and political benefits it had been promised.

North Korea’s declaration of its nuclear activities is a triumph of the sort of diplomacy that President Bush and his aides once eschewed as American weakness.

WASHINGTON —North Korea’s declaration of its nuclear activities is a triumph of the sort of diplomacy — complicated, plodding, often frustrating — that President Bush and his aides once eschewed as American weakness. In more than two years of negotiations, the man who once declared North Korea part of an “axis of evil” with Iran and Iraq, angrily vowing to confront, not negotiate with, its despotic leader, in fact demonstrated a flexibility that his critics at home and abroad once considered impossible. That is why Mr. Bush is likely to receive only grudging credit, if any, for the accomplishment, which could turn out to be the last significant diplomatic breakthrough of his presidency. North Korea’s declaration — and the administration’s quid pro quo lifting of some sanctions — faced criticism from conservatives who attacked it as too little and from liberals who said it came too late. “The regime’s nuclear declaration is the latest reminder that, despite Mr. Bush’s once bellicose rhetoric, engaging our enemies can pay dividends,” Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, whom Mr. Bush defeated in the 2004 presidential election, said in a statement after the declaration on Thursday. “Historians will long wonder,” he continued, “why this administration did not directly engage North Korea before Pyongyang gathered enough material for several nuclear weapons, tested a nuclear device and the missiles to deliver them.” History will not judge Mr. Bush as a dove, even if North Korea steps back from the nuclear threshold. The war in Iraq and his sanction of aggressive tactics in the war on Al Qaeda and other terrorists will shape his legacy more than anything he accomplishes diplomatically. But his second term has featured far more pragmatism and far less confrontation in matters of national security than his first, reflecting the ascendancy of aides like Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and, most significantly in the talks with the North Koreans, Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific affairs. The White House is now pursuing a similarly painstaking multilateral strategy for resolving the international confrontation over Iran’s nuclear activities. Mr. Bush has invested his personal prestige in a peace treaty between the Israelis and Palestinians after years of unambiguous support for Israel’s toughest actions. And after years of international isolation on the issue ofglobal warming, his administration is now offering to negotiate an agreement on cutting emissions with the world’s major developed and developing nations, a plan that received a surprisingly warm response during his visit to Europe this month. “I think one of the things we did in this process, to be honest, is I think we learned a bit,” Mr. Bush’s national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, said at the White House on Thursday. Though speaking of the administration’s willingness to display patience with the North Koreans, even though its declaration came nearly six months after it was promised, his remarks reflected a striking change in the administration’s strategy. Offering and accepting compromise is, of course, part of diplomacy, and it can often be unsatisfactory. The sharpest criticism came from those conservatives who accused Mr. Bush of abandoning his unwillingness, justified in their view, to deal with a government that flagrantly has broken previous commitments and continues to suppress the most basic rights of its people. “Many people understood a lot of things the Bush administration did,” said Danielle Pletka, vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. “While they were not sold very well, they were based on very sound principles, which are core Republican Party principles. What happened to those?” Mr. Bush himself went to great lengths to emphasize that the declaration was only a step, and one that required verification, before any further concessions could be considered. The problem for Mr. Bush is that time is running out. As each day passes, it becomes increasingly likely that little of his ambitious foreign-policy agenda will come to fruition during his presidency. Prospects for achieving an Israeli-Palestinian peace accord this year already appear to have diminished, hobbled by internal Israeli politics. Iran, despite new sanctions by the European Union, appears to be stalling for time — and a new administration. “The last six months in the administration is the wrong time to present these ideas,” said Jon Wolfsthal, a proliferation expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, who credited the president for his evolution on North Korea and other issues. “The Bush administration, to put it mildly, is digging itself out of holes in a number of areas: North Korea, Iran, Iraq, the Middle East. We’ll be lucky to get back to par.” A European diplomat this week lamented Mr. Bush’s tardiness in considering binding limits on emissions, even though Mr.  Bush’s proposal to address global warming will be debated at a gathering of major nations that will take place in conjunction with next month’s meeting of the Group of 8. It was, the diplomat said, a missed opportunity, because most nations are already crafting strategies to deal with the new administration. “If they had been more flexible and been willing to concede some things,” the diplomat said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of protocol, “we could have done something bold.” Even given Thursday’s diplomatic success, Mr. Hadley acknowledged that the final test of the deal — a verifiable denuclearization of North Korea— would come on another president’s watch. “We think we have constructed a better framework that has been more effective,” Mr. Hadley said, “and that is what we will hand over to the next administration, and hopefully they will be in a position to continue this.”

The exploratory trip comes at a time of what appears to be a softening in relations between the United States and North Korea.

With the encouragement of the State Department, officials of theNew York Philharmonicwere en route to North Korea yesterday to discuss a possible concert in Pyongyang in February. The idea of a visit to North Korea, where the totalitarian government keeps a tight rein on the people and sharply restricts access to the outside world, began with a somewhat vague invitation in August but has taken shape in recent weeks. Zarin Mehta, the orchestra’s president, and Eric Latzky, its public relations director, were in Beijing yesterday and are due in North Korea tomorrow. In telephone interviews they said they would examine possible halls, hotels and travel arrangements. “It would be kind of extraordinary for us to play there,” Mr. Mehta said. “If this venture helps in furthering what’s been going on in the last couple of weeks in terms of the normalizing of relationships,” he said,  “that would become a wonderful thing for the world.” The trip by Philharmonic officials coincided with what appeared to be progress in diplomatic efforts to limit North Korea’s nuclear program. An agreement announced on Wednesday sets out a plan for the country to disable its nuclear facilities in exchange for fuel oil or economic aid. The United States is a party to these negotiations, and the Bush administration has praised the deal. The chief United States negotiator, Christopher R. Hill, played a role in brokering a possible Philharmonic visit, meeting with orchestra officials last month at the State Department’s suggestion, Mr. Latzky said. “Ambassador Hill was very encouraging,” he said. “He felt that this would be a positive endeavor.” Mr. Hill was  ambassador to South Korea when the Philharmonic toured there in 2004. He attended a concert and spoke warmly at a reception for the orchestra, Mr. Latzky said. The exploratory trip also comes at a time of what appears to be a softening in relations between the United States and North Korea. Members of North Korea’s United Nations mission, usually required to remain within a small  radius of New York City, were recently granted permission to make a short tourist visit with family members to Washington. University and sports contacts have also increased between the two countries. The visit would probably come at the end of the orchestra’s planned tour in China, from Feb. 7 to 25. Given North Korea’s deep isolation for so many years, it is unclear what conditions would be like for a major Western symphony orchestra. “It’s obviously not routine,” Mr. Mehta said. “It’s a country that none of us have ever dreamed of going to. The next three or four days are going to be very eye-opening for us.” He said the Philharmonic would not consider going to North Korea without American government support. “We didn’t even start to think about going until we had positive signals from the State Department that it was a good thing,” he said. Philharmonic officials point out that a visit with political implications would not be a first for the orchestra. Leonard Bernstein took the orchestra to the Soviet Union in the late 1950s, Mr. Latzky said. Word of the invitation first came in mid-August, Mr. Latzky said, transmitted by a Korean cultural agent in California. A North Korean diplomat from the country’s United Nations mission visited orchestra officials a month later. A formal letter from the Ministry of Culture followed. “As various questions began to be answered, we realized that the next step would be an advance visit,” Mr. Latzky said. North Korea provides some education in Western classical music, Mr. Latzky said. It has at least one important orchestra, the State Symphony Orchestra of the People’s Democratic Republic of Korea, which has made at least one recording and visited South Korea. State media has reported several times that North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-il, has attended performances.

Axis of Evil travelers take note, a British company, Steppes Travel (www.steppestravel.co.uk) is offering to take Americans to North Korea this summer and even secure them hard-to-obtain visas. The group tours, which last four days and three nights, include round-trip flights from Beijing to Pyongyang (you must get to China and back on your own), as well as tours of Mangyongdae (the birthplace of Kim Il Sung), the U.S.S. Pueblo (a captured spy ship) and the Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum (the Korean War Museum). Visitors, who will stay in Pyongyang, will also attend a youth fair, go shopping in Kim Il Sung Square and attend “Mass Games”— a 90-minute performance described by state organizers as a combination of “gymnastic formations, backdrops involving tens of thousands of people and music” that “trains not only the people’s physiques but also their spiritual power.” The price of the trip (not including “Mass Games” and the cost of the visa)  is 1,590 euros per person, or about $2,100 at $1.32 to the euro, with a maximum number of 20 in a group.

BEIJING, Feb. 10 — Negotiations overNorth Korea’s nuclear weapons program stalled on Saturday as disagreements arose about the size and timing of the aid package that would be provided to North Korea in exchange for shutting down the country’s nuclear weapons facilities. “The differences on the issue still remain large,” said Qin Gang, spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry. The impasse occurred amid rising  expectations for an agreement  in Beijing, where the diplomatic talks were under way, and in Washington, where Bush administration officials had predicted a major announcement this weekend. Instead, negotiators from North Korea, China, the United States, South Korea and Japan will meet again on Sunday for a fourth day of talks. Christopher R. Hill, the chief American envoy, would not discuss any specifics about the dispute but said negotiations had largely boiled down to one issue. “Frankly, I had hoped we could get it done on Saturday,” Mr. Hill said. “But I think it’s going to take another day or two.” The diplomatic effort to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue has gone nowhere since the six participating nations signed a broad accord in September 2005 in which North Korea agreed to end its weapons program in exchange for economic and energy benefits, as well as security guarantees. Negotiations almost fell apart last October after North Korea tested a nuclear device. This week’s focus has been on establishing a schedule for shutting down North Korea’s nuclear program, as well as the timing and amount of assistance the North gets in return. Bush administration officials say that the current draft calls for North Korea to shut down and seal its main nuclear facilities within two months in exchange for shipments of fuel oil from South Korea and the opening of talks with Washington over diplomatic recognition. But the process now seems stuck on the fine print of exactly how much help North Korea is demanding. Aleksandr Losyukov, the top Russian negotiator, said the parties had not  decided on final figures for assistance, and he declined to detail the amounts requested by North Korea. “The biggest obstacle to reaching a joint statement remains on the issue of economic aid,” said Mr. Losyukov, according to Xinhua, China’s official news agency. However, at least one diplomat suggested that  the process faced more than one problem. “The situation continues to be severe,” Kenichiro Sasae, the Japanese envoy, told reporters. “We are boiling down our problems, but there is no conclusion in sight for several issues.” Kyodo, the Japanese news agency, quoted an unidentified diplomatic source as saying that North Korea had demanded the equivalent of  about two million tons of fuel oil annually, a figure that stunned other participants. Mr. Hill, speaking to reporters late Saturday night, said North Korea wanted “a very precise measurement with how we are going to get through this.” He predicted that the problem could be solved. “We are kind of reaching a point where we have got to solve this,” he said.

The North Korean military, the world’s fourth largest, has bolstered its special forces units since 2008 and has deployed a new battle tank, called the Storm, the South Korean Defense Ministry said Thursday in a policy report. The report, based on a review conducted every two years, said the North’s overall troop strength remained the same, at an estimated 1.1 million. Only China, the United States and India have larger militaries. The South Korean military has 688,000 troops, making it the sixth largest, according toGlobalSecurity.org, a public policy organization. About 28,500 American troops are based in South Korea. Defense officials in Seoul said Thursday that the North had steadily upgraded its capacity and was better able to strike the South in unconventional and unpredictable ways.

President Obama said countries were ready to offer aid if North Korea gives up its nuclear weapons.

SEOUL, South Korea —President Obamasaid Thursday that the United States would be willing to restart stalled disarmament talks withNorth Koreaif that country showed a “seriousness of purpose,” in what analysts called a slight softening of the stance by Washington and its allies. Speaking after a meeting with President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit meeting in Seoul, Mr. Obama said the North would have to show that it was serious about ending itsnuclear weaponsprogram before the talks — involving the two Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the United States — could resume. He said, however, that the United States, South Korea and other nations were ready to offer hefty economic aid if the North Koreans gave up their weapons once and for all. “They have a choice available to them,”Mr. Obama said.“At the point where it appears that they are in fact prepared to move forward on the kind of path that all of us want to see, then we’re going to be there ready to negotiate with them.” Starting in 2003, the six-nation talks were focused on persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions. But the talks were fitful, and North Korea pulled out last year after international condemnation of its test of a long-range missile. Washington has made offers before to try to restart the negotiations, but political analysts in Seoul said there was now a less strident tone coming from the United States and particularly South Korea. They said the moves might reflect a desire to reduce tensions and bring North Korea back to the negotiating table now that the ailing North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, has positioned his youngest son as his successor. “Now that the succession is almost completed, there is a definite mood shift toward resuming the six-party talks,” said Kim Hyun-wook, a professor at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security, a government-run research institute in Seoul. The shift began a few days ago, when the South Korean president, a conservative who had taken a hawkish stance toward the North, backed away from his insistence that the talks could not resume unless the North apologized for the March sinking of a South Korean warship, theCheonan, which killed 46 sailors. South Korea said it was sunk by a North Korean torpedo; the North has denied involvement. On Thursday, Mr. Lee specified his more modest requirements, saying, “North Korea should and must show sincerity toward the Republic of Korea and to assume responsibility for what they did to the Cheonan.” Analysts said there had also been recent signals by China and Russia, both longtime allies of North Korea, that they desired a reduction of tensions in the region. On Thursday, Mr. Lee and the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, who was also attending the Group of 20 summit meeting, agreed to cooperate in seeking North Korea’s nuclear disarmament. North Korea has signaled its willingness to return to the talks. It blames hostility from the United States and South Korea for the current impasse; the two countries were among its foes during the 1950-53 Korean War and held drills in waters near North Korea after the Cheonan’s sinking. Earlier Thursday, Mr. Obama said in aVeterans Dayspeech at an American Army base in Seoul that the United States remained committed to defending South Korea, and he warned North Korea that it faced continued isolation unless it fulfilled its commitments to give up nuclear weapons. In a strongly worded statement made before thousands of soldiers and Marines gathered on a chilly morning, Mr. Obama called North Korea a starving nation whose economic failures were visible even from space, where at night “the brilliant lights of Seoul” can be seen giving way “to the utter darkness of the North.” During the speech, Mr. Obama also honored the 37,000 Americans and the far larger number of South Koreans who died in the Korean War. He  led the audience in a standing ovation for 62 veterans of that war who attended the speech at the Yongsan base, in the center of this city of gleaming skyscrapers and modern highways. “Gentlemen, we are honored by your presence,” Mr. Obama said. “We are grateful for your service. And the world is better off because of what you did here.”

The Obama administration is discussing whether pressure tactics alone would sway the country’s reclusive dictator.
==::==
2010-08-28T00:00:00Z
==::==
WASHINGTON —The last time a former American president traveled to North Koreaon a rescue mission — Bill Clinton, a year ago — he was feted by its leader,Kim Jong-il, who seized on the visit to reach out to the Obama administration. This week,Mr. Kim chose to go to Chinaduring a visit by former President Jimmy Carter to free another jailed American. Whatever the motivation for Mr. Kim’s snub, analysts said it underscored the deep freeze betweenNorth Koreaand the United States. The State Department greeted the news on Friday that Mr. Carterhad secured the release of Aijalon Mahli Gomesby warning other Americans not to go to North Korea, saying they risked “heavy fines and long prison sentences with hard labor.” Even as it keeps up its tough tone, however, the United States has begun weighing a fresh effort at engagement with Mr. Kim’s government, officials and analysts briefed on the deliberations say. Such an overture would come “several moves down the chessboard,” a senior official said, and would be preceded by additional pressure tactics. But it suggests that the administration has concluded that pressure alone will not be enough to move North Korea’s ailing, reclusive dictator. At a high-level meeting last week on North Korea, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton solicited ideas from outside experts and former officials about the next steps in policy toward the North. The consensus, even among the hawks, was that the United States needed to resume some form of contact with Mr. Kim, according to several people who took part. Mrs. Clinton, these people said, expressed impatience with the current policy, which is based on ever more stringent economic sanctions and joint American-South Korean naval exercises — both in response to the sinking in March of a South Korean warship, for which South Korea blamed the North. Among those advocating a fresh overture is Stephen W. Bosworth, the special envoy for North Korea. He visited Pyongyang, the North’s capital, in December to explore the prospect of talks, but the administration could not decide whether to schedule a follow-up meeting, and then the warship was torpedoed. “The question is, what are we going to do now?” said Joel S. Wit, a former State Department negotiator with North Korea who founded a Web site,38 North, which follows North Korean politics. “The answer is re-engagement. There aren’t any other tools in the toolbox.” Far from abandoning pressure tactics, officials said, the United States is likely to increase them. In July, it announced new measures aimed at choking off sources of hard currency for the government and its allies. Mrs. Clinton sent a senior adviser, Robert J. Einhorn, to Asia to drum up support for the sanctions. The military, defying threats from North Korea and anger from China, has held several days of joint drills with South Korea in the Yellow Sea. “We don’t want to go down the old road and repeat the experiences of the past,” said Jeffrey A. Bader, senior director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council. “We are looking for behavior change by the North Koreans.” Still, there is growing concern, even among hawkish analysts, that pressure, without any dialogue, raises the risk of war. Some critics also contend that there is little evidence the sanctions have forced the North to retreat from its nuclear program or its belligerence toward South Korea. Mr. Kim’s deteriorating health, and the succession struggle it has set off, have increased the pressure on the administration to reach out, in the view of some analysts. While some officials argue that the United States can wait out the political transition, others fear that heightening the confrontation with North Korea could foreclose future opportunities for contact. As Victor Cha, a former Bush administration official who was responsible for North Korea, put it, “If they look like they’re preparing for war, there’s no opportunity to talk to the new leadership.” The administration, analysts said, is also losing confidence in China’s willingness to press the North. During a visit to Beijing in May, Mrs. Clinton invested a lot of energy in trying to persuade Chinese officials to accept the South Korean government’s finding that the North had sunk its ship. Her efforts were futile: Beijing never accepted the North’s culpability and it blunted Seoul’s drive for a United Nations statement condemning the attack. Symbolically, analysts said, Mr. Kim’s choice of a trip to China over a meeting with Mr. Carter highlighted North Korea’s economic and political dependence on Beijing. China has long pushed for the United States to talk to the North, and reopening a dialogue could help ease the tension between Beijing and Washington. One problem for the administration is the form and content of talks. Few analysts have much enthusiasm for the six-party format, under which North Korea has negotiated over its nuclear program with the United States, South Korea, China, Japan and Russia. But the talks are probably necessary to retain  support of allies like South Korea and Japan. Another problem is that the administration has been uncompromising in its demands. Officials have repeatedly said that the United States will not negotiate until North Korea agrees to dismantle itsnuclear weapons. Their fear is that the North will extract concessions, as it did during the Bush and Clinton administrations, only to test another nuclear bomb. An option, experts said, would be to engage North Korea on issues other than the nuclear program. But others said the  issue was unavoidable. For now, the administration offers a more pragmatic strategy. “Americans should heed our travel warning and avoid North Korea,” said the State Department’s spokesman, Philip J. Crowley. “We only have a handful of former presidents.”

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreahas taken its propaganda war against South Korea and the United States to a new frontier: YouTube andTwitter. In the last month, North Korea has posteda series of video clipson YouTube brimming with satire and vitriol against leaders in South Korea and the United States. In one clip, it called Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton a “minister in a skirt” and Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates a “war maniac,” while depicting the South Korean defense minister, Kim Tae-young, as a “servile dog” that likes to be patted by “its American master.” Such language used to be standard in North Korea’s cold-war-era propaganda. Its revival is testimony to the increased chill in relations between the Koreas in recent months. In the past week, North Korea also began operating a Twitter account under the nameuriminzok, or “our nation.” Both the Twitter and YouTube accounts are owned by a user  named “uriminzokkiri.” The Web sitewww.uriminzokkiri.comis run by the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea, a propaganda agency in Pyongyang. Lee Jong-joo, a spokeswoman for the Unification Ministry in Seoul, said, “It is clear that these accounts carry the same propaganda as the North’s official news media, but we have not been able to find out who operates them.” The two Koreas agreed to stop their psychological war after their first summit meeting in 2000. But South Korea resumed propaganda radio broadcasts in May, when it accused the North of torpedoing one of its warships, killing 46 sailors. North Korea, which denies involvement, has vowed to retaliate. It appears to have found a way with Twitter and YouTube, with their intended audience clearly South Koreans. (North Korea keeps its people isolated from the outside world.) “YouTube and Twitter gave North  Korea a high-tech detour for its propaganda,” said Paik Hak-soon, an analyst at Sjong Institute. “But fundamentally, it’s not new technology but rather political tension that drives the North to lash out desperately in the face of mounting international pressure.” During the cold war era, South Korea punished people caught listening to North Korean broadcasts. Several years ago, during the brief era of its “sunshine policy” of engaging the North, the South allowed its people access to North Korean Web sites. But today, when a computer user in South Korea clicks on an item on the North Korean Twitter account, a government warning against “illegal content” pops up. These blocks have triggered criticism here that the Seoul government does not trust its people to form their own opinions about the totalitarian North. But the government says the North is using the Internet to spread conspiracy theories about who was behind the sinking of the South Korean warship, including one claim that an American submarine did so to foster a militant mood in the South. The Twitter account, which provides links to the North Korean Web site, had 928 followers as of Monday. But a few YouTube video clips uploaded by the North commanded thousands of views. In one such clip, North Korea attacked Yu Myung-hwan, the South Korean foreign minister, who recently criticized “pro-North Korean youths” who voted for the opposition in the June local elections, saying, “If they like the North so much, they should go and live under Kim Jong-il.” The clip’s narrator calls Mr. Yu a “pro-American flunky” and  advised Mr. Yu to earn a living “mopping the floor of the Pentagon.” Another clip claimed that North Korea would prevail in a war with the “American imperialists” because it was armed with nuclear-fusion technology; because of its juche, or ideology of “self-reliance”; and because of a philosophical treatise written by Kim Il-sung, the North’s founding president and the father of Kim Jong-il, who died in 1994. “I don’t think this propaganda from the North will have any significant impact among South Koreans,” said Yoo Ho-yeol, an expert on North Korea at Korea University here.  “People watch this for fun, not to be influenced.”

SEOUL, South Korea — The North Korean government has made a rare apology for a policy blunder and lifted a ban on using foreign currency, South Korean news organizations said Thursday. Recent changes to the North Korean monetary system had set offan unusually public outcryagainst the North Korean government. If confirmed, the apology and the policy reversal are further signals that the North is retreating from its campaign against the free markets that have proliferated in the impoverished country. After years of struggling to contain the markets, which are technically forbidden,North Koreatook its boldest step yet byabolishing its old bank notesin late November. The government allowed people to exchange only a limited amount of old money for the new currency, at a rate of 100 to 1, a measure that effectively wiped out much of the private wealth that had been accumulated by entrepreneurs who profited from the markets. The government also banned the holding or use of foreign currency, widely used to smuggle in basic goods from China. The policy backfired. Prices skyrocketed as market activities ground to a near halt, while state-run stores failed to meet the demand for goods. In recent weeks, Web sites based in Seoul that collect news from sources inside North Korea have reported instances of starvation in some towns in the North, a protest rally by elderly military veterans and arguments between women and the soldiers trying to shut down markets. The reported apology, from the North Korean prime minister, Kim Yong-il, came just days after South Korean news outlets reported that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, fired the senior official who had spearheaded the currency changes. The apology came at a meeting in the North’s capital, Pyongyang, last Friday, according to theChosun Ilbo, a newspaper in Seoul. Its report, published Thursday, quoted Prime Minister Kim as saying, “I offer a sincere apology about the currency reform, as we pushed ahead with it without sufficient preparation and it caused a great pain to the people.” Thepaper’s account, published Thursday, quoted an unidentified source inside the North. “We will do our best to stabilize people’s lives,” the prime minister said, according to the newspaper. The South Korean national news agency Yonhap carried the same report on Thursday. AndGood Friends, a relief agency based in Seoul that has informants inside the North, carried a similar report on its Web site earlier this week. Government officials in Seoul were unable to confirm the new reports, although they privately acknowledged that the North’s currency changes had spawned unrest in some parts of the country. There were no reports of the apology in the North’s state-run media. The meeting in which the apology was offered brought together thousands of chiefs of inminban, or “people’s squads,” the news reports said. The inminban is the most basic administrative unit in the North, typically composed of 20 to 40 households. The chiefs are the government’s grass-roots messengers and supervisors. An apology at such a meeting would be the closest thing to a mass public apology in the North. This week, the Unification Ministry of South Korea estimated that the North’s production of grains for 2009 dropped 5 percent, to 4.1 million tons. The North needs an estimated 5.1 million tons to feed its people, United Nations relief agencies say. Poor weather, inept economic management and the loss of aid and trade after the collapse of the Soviet bloc led to a famine that killed many North Koreans in the mid-1990s. Since then, illegal markets have sprouted to supplement, or sometimes replace, the state’s failed ration system. Nuclear Envoy to Visit U.S. SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A senior North Korean nuclear envoy will visit the United States next month for rare bilateral talks, a news agency reported Friday as diplomats pushed to revive negotiations on endingNorth Korea’s nuclear program. Plans call for the envoy, Kim Kye-gwan to meet with American officials in Washington, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency reported from Beijing, citing an unidentified source. A meeting between the North Korean envoy and United States officials would be a strong sign that the push to get disarmament talks back on track was gaining momentum.

North Korea is reported to have dismissed the official who oversaw a sweeping monetary conversion last year that led to price increases and social unrest.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Korea’s sweeping attempts to revive socialist central economic planning and crack down on private markets appear to have set off runaway inflation and perhaps caused the country’s reclusive leaders to reconsider  some of their own measures, according to South Korean news reports and intelligence officials. As one indicator of a possible shift in the leadership’s approach, North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-il, is reported to have dismissed the official who oversaw a sweeping monetary conversion late last year that led to severe price increases and social unrest, which is unusual in North Korea, a tightly policed nation. The official, Pak Nam-gi, chief of the finance and planning department of the ruling Workers’ Party of North Korea, was blamed for skyrocketingfood pricesthat had severely curtailed the country’s already meager food supplies, according to the Chosun Ilbo, a mass-circulation daily newspaper in Seoul. TheChosun Ilbo article, which was published Wednesday, cited unidentified diplomatic sources in China. The South Korean government could not confirm the report. Mr. Kim moves top party officials so secretively that some of those reported to have been banished have often later resurfaced with senior posts. But analyses by South Korean experts who monitor the situation across the border suggest that a series of steps by Mr. Kim’s government to close private markets, radically revalue the currency and restrict the importing of consumers goods from China have created a new crisis for the country’s perennially ailing economy. Prices of basic goods have sharply risen since the government replaced the old bank notes in late November, exchanging them for new bills at a rate of 100 to 1, according to officials here and reports on Seoul-based Web sites that glean information from sources inside the North. North Korea placed a cap on how much old money a citizen could exchange for the new currency, effectively confiscating private stores of wealth. Reports said it also outlawed foreign currency holdings and punished private traders who smuggled goods from China. But in an effort to reward people who depend on state salaries, like factory workers and members of the military, the government paid the same nominal wages in new currency, theoretically increasing their purchasing power a hundredfold. The underlying idea was to suppress the country’s black markets and reassert the economic model of central planning. “The problem with the currency reform was that it hurt imports through unofficial channels while state-run stores failed to stock their shelves with goods,” said Dong Yong-sueng, an expert on the North Korean economy at the Samsung Economic Research Institute in Seoul. “The factory workers, with their boosted purchasing power, turned to the unofficial markets, driving up the prices. “Whether this is a temporary problem or the regime will eventually take control of the situation — we won’t find out until one or two months from now.” The South Korean unification minister, Hyun In-taek, also said it was too early to measure the impact of the currency changes in the North. Illegal markets had been mushrooming in North Korea since the government’s ration system failed to supply enough food, leading to a devastating famine in the mid-1990s. A new class of traders emerged, operating outside the official system and establishing corrupt ties with party officials, according to analysts in Seoul. The emergence of a merchant class and repeated visits by Mr. Kim to different cities in China were taken as signs that the North was cautiously embracing elements of a market economy. But the steps taken in the past few years suggest a sharp shift in the other direction. Mr. Pak, the official said to have been dismissed, took the top financial job in 2005 as North Korea began introducing a series of measures aimed at suppressing the black markets. He led the currency reform, which North Korea hoped would arrest inflation by eliminating profiteering in private markets. That was viewed as an important task to be carried out before the youngest of Mr. Kim’s three sons, Kim Jong-un, was to be officially anointed as the leader’s successor, around 2012, the Chosun Ilbo said. But the currency revaluation instead fueled much higher inflation and uncertainty, bringing market activities nearly to a halt and driving people to panic, South Korean reports and analysts said. Mr. Pak disappeared from reports in North Korea’s state-run media in early January. A group of veterans from the 1950-53 Korean War staged a protest last month, sitting in front of a party office in Danchon, a town on North Korea’s eastern coast,according to Good Friends, a relief group based in Seoul. The unusual show of public discontent in North Korea took place after some people in Danchon died of hunger, the group said. The government quickly released emergency food in late January to quell the unrest, it added. “As the food situation worsened in the North,” Good Friends said, “there is talk there that if the government did not come out with drastic measures to improve the situation by the end of February, it could trigger an uprising.” Good Friends runs one ofseveral Web sitesthat provide news on North Korea, using sources inside the North. Its reports often describe small sectors of North Korean society. In some parts of North Korea, food prices have more than tripled in the past three weeks, according to Daily NK, another Web site that specializes in North Korean news. The value of dollars on the black market, it said, was soaring as well. The inflationary surge appears to have two related causes. One is that private sales of goods have become far riskier, pushing up the price of any goods available outside the state distribution system. The other is that the currency move at least temporarily rewarded the elite and the loyal class of state workers, who received sharp salary increases they could spend at state stores. But the North’s centrally planned economy has long lacked the ability to produce enough food and consumer goods at state-set prices, meaning demand outstripped supply even more than it usually does.

To the Editor: Re “Clinton Secures Two Pardons; All 3 Leave North Korea” (front page, Aug. 5): With shock and awe I learned that former President Bill Clinton was successful in securing pardons for two jailed journalists, Euna Lee and Laura Ling, from North Korean officials. Freedom, it would seem, can be won through diplomacy. We should write this down somewhere. Emlyn AddisonProvidence, R.I., Aug. 5, 2009  To the Editor: As Bill Clinton has said, “Character is a journey, not a destination.” Over the years, time has graced him with quiet elegance, softening his demeanor. It has unlocked his insatiable need to listen, learn, give and build bridges between communities. We could not have sent a more persuasive envoy to communicate with Kim Jong-il and negotiate the release of the American journalists. The timing was brilliant, and the mission could not have been successful without the trust and confidence of President Obama. Colette JenkinsPhoenix, Aug. 5, 2009  To the Editor: Former President Bill Clinton’s mission to bring back two imprisoned journalists from North Korea demonstrates the success of statesmanship and diplomacy. But we do not know what understandings, agreements or promises Mr. Clinton may have made on behalf of the United States to secure the release of the women. We do not know the price for this success. It may open further dialogue and lead the way to mutual benefit between Korea and the United States, or it may only enhance the credibility of a repressive and dangerous nuclear-armed regime. While a free press is vital to democracy and the women may be seen as brave journalists who were attempting to investigate and report on that regime, they caused an international crisis. The cost of this crisis, whether it is limited to the expenses of Mr. Clinton’s diplomatic mission or an incalculable amount depending on whether something was promised, will not be paid by the journalists or the news media that sent them to Korea. Michael E. MahlerLos Angeles, Aug. 5, 2009  To the Editor: Who knew that a simple condolence note from then-President Bill Clinton to Kim Jong-il regarding his father’s death in 1994 would be a major catalyst in freeing two journalists? You quote a former official as saying that freeing the women was a “reciprocal humanitarian gesture.” Politesse trumps politics. Darcy Heller SternbergNew York, Aug. 5, 2009  To the Editor: I’m no fan of Bill Clinton, but kudos to him and the Obama administration for going to North Korea and engaging in détente instead of saber-rattling to secure the release of the two imprisoned female journalists. This tactic is the antithesis of the Bush-Cheney taciturn approach to world politics. Who knows now what the United States might accomplish by talking with North Korea?
