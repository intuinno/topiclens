SEOUL — The current crisis over North Korea’s pursuit of nuclear weapons has unmistakable parallels with the events of spring 1994. Then, as now, North Korea was plunging ahead to make bomb-grade plutonium at its nuclear complex in Yongbyon. Then as now, the United States was rallying international support for sanctions against the North. Tensions spiked as North Korea warned it would consider any sanctions an “act of war.” There is, however, one key difference. In 1994, the United States was prepared to attack the North Korean nuclear complex, says Kim Young-sam, who was South Korea’s president at the time. That prospect prompted South Korea to reject any moves against the North. How Seoul responded to Washington’s handling of the crisis in 1994, as Mr. Kim described it in a recent interview, illuminates South Koreans’ continuing quandary in the long-running nuclear standoff: They may loathe North Korea for having invaded the South in 1950,  for starving its people, for building nuclear weapons. But, with the carnage of the Korean War still fresh in their collective memory,  they also recoil whenever they sense the United States is pushing North Korea too hard, fearful this might provoke Pyongyang to lash out in a suicidal attack. In 1994, Mr. Kim said, “the Americans were quite adamant about attacking Yongbyon. They had 33 warships positioned off the east coast.” He envisioned an apocalyptic scene in Seoul,  just 65 kilometers, or 40 miles, from the border, within striking distance of North Korean artillery and rockets. “I said absolutely no to the United States unilaterally bombing Yongbyon,” Mr. Kim said. “The North Korean artillery would have been rolling out within three minutes, and Seoul would have turned into a sea of fire.” Mr. Kim can hardly be accused of spinelessness before an adversary. He had his two military-backed predecessors arrested on corruption and sedition charges, forever shutting the military out of South Korean politics. But his rush to shield North Korea from an American strike speaks volumes about the complicated mix of disdain and fear, kinship and even nationalistic pride South Koreans   —   even many politically conservative, anti-Communist  South Koreans  —  feel about the North. U.S. officials came to appreciate this mentality during the subsequent decade of liberal rule, from 1998 till 2008. As the government engaged North Korea, surveys showed that the South Korean public considered the United States a bigger threat to peace than North Korea. One liberal politician  said that if the United States planned to attack Yongbyon, he would lead thousands of  “peace-loving” South Koreans across the border to form a human shield around the nuclear complex. Such emotionally charged friction between Seoul and Washington has subsided in recent years, as the governments of President Lee Myung-bak in Seoul and President Barack Obama in Washington conclude that they can prevail against the North only if they forge a united approach. Still, the South Korean outlook  —  distrusting the North, but wary of U.S. intervention against the North —  remains fundamentally unchanged. In 1994, as the United States prepared to evacuate American civilians and beefed up forces here, the South Korean stock market plummeted. Citizens stockpiled instant noodles and candles. This spring, when North Korea conducted a nuclear test and launched a long-range rocket, the local markets and the public hardly blinked, confident the United States would not take military action. U.S. officials tend to view the North’s nuclear program within the global framework of combating proliferation. But to ordinary South Koreans, it is just a latest episode in the decades-old hostilities from the Korean War, which halted with a cease-fire in 1953 and has yet to end with a formal peace. Opinions among South Koreans on how to resolve the nuclear crisis depend on how they see the North Korean government. Is it an evil regime bent on keeping its dictatorial grip on a starving people and building nuclear bombs to deter meddling from the outside? Or is it a cornered beast whose threats are a desperate cry for a way out? Whichever side they take, ordinary South Koreans hardly see the nuclear crisis in global terms, but rather within the highly local context of how to end the war and possibly reunify the peninsula. That partly explains why South Korean leaders over the years, both conservative and liberal, were eager for a meeting with their North Korean counterparts. Mr. Kim almost had one. Like most South Koreans of his generation, Mr. Kim, 81, harbors a visceral mistrust of North Korea. His mother was murdered in 1960 by a North Korean agent who attacked his island village. But when former President Jimmy Carter of the United States traveled to Pyongyang to help defuse the nuclear crisis in 1994 and returned with a proposal for an inter-Korean meeting, Mr. Kim readily accepted it. He saw a momentous opportunity as a politician. “Unifying the fatherland” is an idea drilled into the heads of schoolchildren on both sides of the border. Koreans’ greatest historical grievance is the peninsula’s division by the United States and Soviet Union at the end of World War II. Mr. Kim was to meet the North Korean leader, Kim Il-sung, in Pyongyang on July 25, 1994. But two weeks beforehand, on July 8, the 82-year-old Kim Il-sung died of a heart attack. “Fate played a trick on me,” Mr. Kim said with a tone of regret. “If I had met Kim Il-sung, I would have changed the nation’s history.” The achievement that had eluded him  —  becoming the first South Korean leader to hold a summit meeting with North Korea  —  went to Mr. Kim’s rival and successor, Kim Dae-jung. In 2000, Kim Dae-jung flew to Pyongyang and met with Kim Jong-il, Kim Il-sung’s son and successor. That year, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Today, Kim Young-sam remains the outspoken conservative critic of North Korea, while Kim Dae-jung is still the tireless evangelist for engaging it. “Over the years, both the Americans and we have conducted many negotiations with the North Koreans, but all of them failed,” Kim Young-sam said. “We can never trust the North Koreans.” But during the interview at his Seoul residence, decorated with photos of Mr. Kim smiling and posing with American leaders, Mr. Kim said he was proud of having averted war by stopping his U.S. ally from attacking Yongbyon  — even though he concedes that this may have emboldened Pyongyang. “Looking back,” he said, “I think the North Koreans think they can say whatever they want because no matter what they do, the Americans will never attack them.” Such is the South Korean dilemma.

Choi Se-woong defected from North Korea in 1995 and has since built a reputation as one of the most prominent North Korean entrepreneurs in the South.

SEOUL — Choi Se-woong’s day is just like that of many other businessmen here. He wakes up at 5:30 a.m., checks the news headlines with a cup of coffee and then drives to work in the financial district of Yeouido. What makes Mr. Choi different is the unusual path he took in his life. He defected from North Korea in 1995 and has since built a reputation as one of the most prominent North Korean entrepreneurs in the South. “I have Kim Jong-il to thank for finding the job of my life,” said Mr. Choi, 49, referring to the North Korean leader. He spoke between puffs on a cigarette at a coffee shop in a Seoul hotel recently. Growing up, Mr. Choi was one of the privileged few, eventually studying German literature at Kim Il-sung University. His family had connections to the government — his father is Choi Hee-byeok, who was North Korea’s de facto finance minister as director of the finance and accounting department of the Workers’ Party. It was Kim Jong-il who suggested to the elder Mr. Choi that his son should learn finance. Today, Mr. Choi is a managing director of foreign exchange marketing with NH Investment & Futures, a futures brokerage house in Seoul. He lives with his two children and wife, Shin Yeong-hee, who was once a dancer at Mansudae Art Theater, a prestigious art troupe in North Korea. Mr. Choi’s first encounter with capitalism was in 1984, when he went to work in Vienna at the Golden Star Bank, which at that time was the only North Korean bank abroad. (The bank eventually shut down in 2004, long after Mr. Choi’s time there, as international suspicion about illegal activities at the bank rose.) Several years after he arrived in Vienna, Mr. Choi moved on to London and worked at Development Investment Bank, a foreign exchange trading firm that has since closed and was set up by Daesong Bank of North Korea and a British entrepreneur. “The education I got associated capitalism with imperialism and aggression,” he said. “I thought it would be cold, like lacking humanity and loyalty among friends.” While in London, Mr. Choi ended up lending the money he had made to the North Korean Embassy. “The embassy didn’t get much support from the regime in the ’90s,” he said. It was while in London that Mr. Choi decided he would not go back to North Korea. He said that he had become “fed up” with the system and did not want to raise his children there. He declined to be more specific because he feared retaliation against family members still in the North. Before his defection, his father lost his position in a political reshuffle, meaning that Mr. Choi’s life upon return would be less privileged. He arrived in South Korea on Dec. 12, 1995, via a route he declined to disclose to prevent a crackdown on potential defectors. Now, 15 years later, Mr. Choi is still fighting. “It’s a constant battle,” he said. In 2009, 2,927 North Koreans defected to the South, up from 1,000 in 2002. The number is rising each year, and the Unification Ministry predicts that the total number of defectors will soon exceed two million. Getting a job is a big challenge for North Korean defectors, in part, observers say, because of education and in part because of prejudice. A recent survey showed that 13.7 percent of defectors between 15 and 64 years old were jobless as of last November, about four times the unemployment rate for South Koreans. Those who landed jobs earned an average of just 1.27 million won, or about $1,100, a month last year, which is less than half of the average income in Seoul. Mr. Choi has had more luck, thanks to his education and experience. Soon after he arrived in South Korea, he got a job at Korea Financial Telecommunications and Clearings Institute, a company that manages payment systems between banks. At the height of the Asian financial crisis, Mr. Choi tried his luck in the restaurant business. In 1998, he opened a restaurant named Jinadallaegak, specializing in North Korean-style naengmyeon, or cold noodles. The restaurant gave him enough capital by the year 2000 to set up SN Bank, a company providing 24-hour online foreign currency trading for individuals and small businesses. It was believed to be the first such service in South Korea. SN Bank was having financial problems and he sold it in 2006. He held several other finance jobs, increasing his pay all the while. Most recently, he joined NH in October, having been recruited after conducting a training course for employees there. Not all has been smooth. He was once sued by an employee at his restaurant when he refused to give the worker a raise. And when he developed the 24-hour online foreign currency trading service, his business partner tried to take credit for it. There are certain things anybody doing business in Korea should learn, he said: drinking and golf. Kim Jong-il ordered all North Koreans living overseas to stop drinking alcohol. So when he arrived in the South, he flatly refused to drink. Only later did he realize it was considered rude, and he now drinks alcohol. As for golf, Mr. Choi joked that his game had gotten so good that no one could tell anymore that he came from the North. Kim Hyung-eun is a business reporter at Korea JoongAng Daily.

North Korea’s government appears to be trying to build a personality cult around Kim Jong-un, the youngest son of Kim Jong-il.

SUNGNAM, South Korea — The black-and-white photographs that were published last month in a North Korean newspaper appear no different from other propaganda coming fromNorth Korea: they show the supreme leader,Kim Jong-il, touring a steel plant in a fur cap and his trademark sunglasses. It is the pudgy but stern-faced young man next to him, dressed in a snappy Western suit and dutifully scribbling in a notebook, who has spurred intense speculation. Could this unidentified man be just a plant manager? Or could this be the first public appearance ofKim Jong-un, the North Korean leader’s third son and heir apparent? “There, see how his face is in focus and illuminated even more than Kim Jong-il himself?” said Cheong Seong-chang, a specialist on North Korean politics at the Sejong Institute. “There is a high possibility that this is Kim Jong-un.” Little is known about the inner workings of the secretive North Korean government, not even the identity of the heir apparent. But if Mr. Cheong is right, the enigmatic photographs are the latest signs of the desperate push that the North Korean government is making to build a cult of personality around the son, who is believed to be 27, to prepare him to assume control as the current leader’s health declines. The elder Mr. Kim, 68, appeared to suffer a stroke two years ago, and there have been recent reports that he is suffering from kidney disease. Analysts say that if Mr. Kim dies too soon, his son could be pushed aside in a scramble for power among political and military elites that would end the family’s dynastic rule and might even bring about the collapse of the impoverished totalitarian state. While this internal struggle is going on, problems continue to mount. A ham-handed currency revaluation last fall, aimed at reasserting central control over the economy, is reported to have badly backfired, producing unrest and disaffection with the government. At the same time, the spread of cellphones and DVD players has broken the North’s self-imposed isolation, giving many of its citizens a sense for the first time of how poor and backward their country has become. Recently, the government is said to have given mass promotions and luxury cars to officers in the nation’s powerful military, in a bid to cement their loyalty. Indeed, the sinking last month of a South Korean warship, which many South Koreans now suspect was the work of a North Korean torpedo, is widely seen in the South as a show of strength by the North aimed at winning the military’s support for the younger Mr. Kim. Despite the breakdown of communications barriers, reliable information on the political system remains scant. Photographs like those that appeared in last month’s Rodong Sinmun, the ruling party’s newspaper, are among the limited evidence that analysts and intelligence experts must rely on as they try to understand the efforts to shore up the Kim dynasty for a third generation. “This remains Kremlinology,” said Lee Ki-dong, a researcher on North Korea at the Institute for National Strategy, referring to the cold-war-era study of politics in the former Soviet Union. “We have to scrutinize the Rodong Sinmun as if we were looking for nuggets in a gold mine.” Not much is known about the man who could become the next leader of the unpredictable, nuclear-armed country, even including what he looks like. The only firsthand account comes from a Japanese chef who once worked for the Kim family and knew Kim Jong-un only as a personable and precocious boy.  The only known photograph of him was taken when he was 11 years old. It is also unknown whether Kim Jong-un has any rivals. For a time, North Korea watchers regarded the leader’s eldest son, Kim Jong-nam, 39, as the most likely heir — until he was caught by Japanese authorities using a fake passport to visit Tokyo Disneyland. He now lives in Macao, giving occasional paid interviews to Japanese television. Reports out of North Korea indicate that the government is trying to build a cult of personality around Kim Jong-un, just as it did during the last succession, when the current leader replaced his father, the North’s founder, Kim Il-sung. But while Kim Jong-il is believed to have had two decades as heir before assuming power after his father’s death in 1994, his son is being rolled out much faster. Moreover, some experts say, the average North Korean is growing worldly and aware of life outside the country’s borders, making it increasingly unlikely that the government’s often bizarre propaganda efforts will succeed. On Monday, the Daily NK, a Web site that specializes in information on North Korea, said it had obtained aninternal propaganda documentthat called Kim Jong-un the Youth Captain and quoted his father (who has his own title, Dear Leader) praising his loyalty and good works. The documents also extolled the son for such achievements as managing a fireworks display last year in Pyongyang, the capital, and becoming a proficient driver of military vehicles, the Daily NK reported. “He is a genius of geniuses,” the document says. “He has been endowed by nature with special abilities. There is nobody on the planet who can defeat him in terms of faith, will and courage.” Mr. Cheong, the analyst, said that members of local North Korean work units and government employees had been taught a new song titled “Footsteps,” which lauds Kim Jong-un’s fitness to follow his father as leader. Kim Jong-il has been rushing to prepare the ground for his son in other ways, analysts say. They said that wiretaps of North Korean phones by the South’s intelligence agency revealed that the younger Mr. Kim was appointed to a top post in the ruling party’s internal security apparatus last year and that he now worked in the same building as his father. The analysts have offered many predictions about what may happen when the current leader does die. One is that his brother-in-law, Jang Song-taek, 64, widely seen as the second most powerful member of the inner circle, could serve as a regent until the younger Mr. Kim is ready to rule — or simply hold onto power for himself. “The signs are that the elite do not take Kim Jong-un seriously,” said Kim Yeon-su, a professor of North Korean studies at the National Defense University in Seoul. “This is the final stage of the Kim family dictatorship.”

The North Korean military has bolstered its special-forces units during the past two years and has deployed a new battle tank, South Korea said in its biennial white paper.

SEOUL, South Korea — The North Korean military, the world’s fourth-largest, has bolstered its special-forces units during the past two years and has deployed a new battle tank, called the Storm, while expanding its tank brigades, the South Korean Defense Ministry said on Thursday in its biennial white paper. The report said the North’s overall troop strength had remained the same since 2008, when the active-duty force was estimated at 1.1 million. With a population of 24 million,North Koreahas by far the world’s largest military in per capita terms. In actual numbers of troops, only China, the United States and India are larger. The South Korean military has 688,000 troops, making it the sixth-largest over all, according toGlobalSecurity.org, a public policy organization focused on military and security issues. Some 28,500 American troops are also based in South Korea. Defense officials in Seoul said Thursday that the North had steadily upgraded its capabilities in asymmetric warfare and was better able to strike the South in unconventional and unpredictable ways. A rise in special-operations troops, to 200,000 from 180,000, was indicative of that shift in strategy. The white paper said the North’s new battle tank, the Pokpung-ho, was apparently based on former Soviet and Russian models. It was estimated that the North now had 4,100 tanks in service, up from 3,900 in 2008. Defense officials declined to comment on how the ministry had gathered the information on the North’s military. They also would not confirm reports that the North had shifted more troops to the land border with the South. The border zone between the two Koreas is one of the most heavily militarized in the world. North and South Korea are still technically at war: The 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, rather than a full peace treaty. A much-studied facet of each defense white paper is the South’s description of North Korea. “North Korea is our enemy,” a defense official said Thursday, repeating the language of the new report. Enemy is a stronger term than the previous white paper used. In 1994, a North Korean official notoriously vowed to turn Seoul into a “sea of fire,” and the white paper the following year reflected the strained relations, describing the North as the “main enemy” of the South. That description was eventually downgraded to “serious threat” in 2004, under President Roh Moo-hyun. But in 2008, the conservative government of President Lee Myung-bak ratcheted it back up, using the words “direct and serious threat.” Since then, North Korea has conducted a second nuclear test; allegedly torpedoed a South Korean warship, killing 46 sailors; revealed a new and sophisticated uranium-enrichment facility; and struck a South Korean island, killing four persons, during an artillery battle. “Not using the expression ‘main enemy’ does not mean that we have softened our stance,” Deputy Defense Minister Chang Kwang-il told reporters. The conservative daily Chosun Ilbo said in a commentary on Thursday: “There is no way to avoid calling such a country an enemy. “The main opposition Democratic Party said labeling North Korea as an enemy would ‘drive a wedge’ into inter-Korean relations. Surely it must realize that North Korea is the one driving a wedge between the two sides by threatening the South with a nuclear attack.” On Thursday, Russia urged both Koreas to return to six-nation talks in order to reduce tension on the Korean Peninsula. “It is imperative to stop military activity,” Deputy Foreign Minister Alexei Borodavkin said, according to the Reuters news service, “and move from muscle flexing to dialogue between the North and South.” Mr. Borodavkin’s comments appeared to reinforceChina’s call for a return to talksafter the Nov. 23 barrage on Yeonpyeong Island. It also followed Mr. Lee’sstatements on Wednesdaythat he would be willing to endorse restarting the multiparty talks.

South Korea has not responded to the disclosure on Sunday of a new nuclear enrichment plant.

SEOUL, South Korea — Revelations of a uranium enrichment facility inNorth Koreafound the South Korean government and nuclear experts grappling for a response. “If this information is true, then this is a serious problem,” an official with the South’s Defense Ministry said on Monday, referring to the facility that was seen this month by an American nuclear scientist on a visit to North Korea. The defense official and other government officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of the issue and because the South Korean government was still formulating its position. “Our ministry is watching and monitoring North Korea’s nuclear activity,” said the defense official, adding that he was not permitted to say whether the military had known that the facility existed before the American scientist, Siegfried S. Hecker, disclosed  it. The revelationswere first reported Sundayin The New York Times. Several other senior government officials said Monday that they were surprised by the news of the highly sophisticated plant, which Mr. Hecker describedin a reportas an “industrial-scale uranium enrichment facility with 2,000 centrifuges.” One senior official in Seoul said the government had long had “suspicions” of the North’s continuing enrichment program. Although the new revelations were “a serious matter,” he said, he characterized the mood in his ministry as “not that panicked.” Wi Sung-lac, Seoul’s chief negotiator on nuclear issues, met Monday morning in Seoul with Stephen W. Bosworth, the United States special envoy for North Korea, who called the new North Korean enrichment effort “disappointing” and “not helpful.” On Monday afternoon, Mr. Wi traveled to Beijing to meet with his Chinese counterparts, a trip that had been previously scheduled. China is North Korea’s only major ally. On Monday, South Korea’s foreign minister, Kim Sung-hwan, played down the new facility, saying, “It’s nothing new.” But some political analysts in Seoul were alarmed at an apparent lapse in intelligence gathering by United States and South Korean agencies. “These are supposedly the best and brightest guys and they’re making such stupid mistakes,” said Moon Chung-in, a professor of political science at Yonsei University in Seoul. “Washington and Seoul always fall into the pattern of looking at North Korea from their own negative perceptions. They are blinded by their own stereotypes, prejudices and inertia.” Mr. Moon said the North had publicly announced that it would continue with its nuclear efforts if international sanctions against the government remained in place. On April 15 of last year, the North Korean Foreign Ministry said it would “proceed with our own LWR fuel cycle,” referring to the production of low-enriched uranium for use in a civilian light-water reactor. North Korean atomic officialsrecently told Mr. Heckerand a former American diplomat, Jack Pritchard, that they had begun construction of such a reactor. “Intelligence agencies in South Korea and the U.S. haven’t even been paying attention to official announcements from North Korea,” Mr. Moon said. “There was no reaction from Washington and Seoul. They just said it was North Korea bluffing or for propaganda purposes.” But now that the North has unveiled its new enrichment facility, Mr. Moon said, “North Korea has proved they can deliver.” Analysts, including Kim Seoc-woo, a proliferation expert and director of the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul, said the North Koreans would have had to have help. Traders using smuggling channels might have brought banned nuclear equipment into the North using an overland route — starting from Iran, then through Afghanistan and perhaps Pakistan, then into China and on to North Korea, the analysts said.

SEOUL, South Korea — The ailing North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, may soon visit China, the North’s last remaining  patron, to seek help as his government faces its greatest crisis since the catastrophic famine in the mid-1990s, according to South Korean officials and news reports. Reports of Mr. Kim’s “imminent trip” to China, in what would be his fifth visit to Beijing since he took power in 1994, have been circulating here for months. In an unusual prediction, the office of President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea said this week that there was “a high level of possibility” that Mr. Kim would visit China. The likelihood of Mr. Kim’s trip increased after a recent exchange of high-level delegations between the North and China, during which Mr. Kim was formally invited to Beijing. The predictions also stem from the fact that analysts say Mr. Kim is facing both external and internal pressures that are forcing him to reach out to the one remaining, if reluctant, source of aid: China. “His biggest goal on a trip to China will be securing help to overcome the North’s economic crisis,” said Choi Myeong-hae, a visiting professor at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security in Seoul. As payback for such aid,North Koreamight be expected to return to the six-nation talks, a forum that China presides over and that is aimed at persuading the North to give up itsnuclear weaponsprogram in exchange for economic and diplomatic rewards. Experts on North Korea say that Mr. Kim, a reclusive yet shrewd survivalist, might try to obtain Chinese investment or aid, which could weaken the impact of United Nations sanctions, while continuing to hold on to his nuclear program, which is his last bargaining chip and a source of national pride he can hold up before his people, who are said to be facing growing food shortages. Mr. Kim, 68, is also thought to be in declining health, after a stroke in 2008. He is now undergoing dialysis every two weeks, according to Nam Sung-wook, director of the Institute for National Security and Strategy, a research organization affiliated with South Korea’s main spy agency. Mr. Kim, who inherited power after the death of his father, Kim Il-sung, in 1994, is hurrying to groom his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, 27, as his heir, officials in south Korea say. To justify another dynastic succession, he is proposing to build a “strong and prosperous nation” by 2012. But recent seizures of cargo out of North Korea demonstrate  that the United Nations embargo, tightened after the North’s nuclear test in May 2009, is squeezing the North’s ability to export weapons, a major source of hard currency.Food aidfrom South Korea has dried up under President Lee, a conservative who wants to see North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons program. The government’s disastrous currency revaluation in November, meant to fight inflation and curb free markets, has also deepened food shortages. Mr. Kim, who has kept his people in isolation and fearful of prison gulags, has outlived previous predictions of the collapse of his government, even after an estimated two million North Koreans died of famine in the mid-1990s. But the North Korea of today is not the North Korea of the 1990s. South Korean DVDs and outside news are smuggled in from China. The currency revaluation elicited highly unusual outbursts of public anger. North Korea “is facing several domestic problems that in isolation would each be manageable but together could threaten regime survival,” Daniel Pinkston, an International Crisis Group researcher, said in arecent report. But he also cautioned that for now, the state security apparatus and the barriers to collective action made a “revolution from below” impossible. Meanwhile, the government seems to be gambling that it can tighten political control by cracking down on private markets, a conduit of capitalist influence, while trying to improve food supplies and the economy with Chinese help. “Markets will be removed in the future, by reducing their numbers step by step, while continuously expanding the planned supply through state-run commercial networks,” Ri Ki-song, a professor at the North’s state-run Academy of Social Sciences, said in an interview in Pyongyang, North Korea’s capital, that was broadcast on APTN on Thursday. B. R. Myers, a North Korea expert at Dongseo University in South Korea, said at a forum in Seoul this week that the North’s currency reform and crackdown on the markets might not be as unpopular as reported. It is likely that they did not affect most North Koreans, he said, except those relatively few who had amassed a private fortune through black markets. Mr. Kim’s plea for aid will be strengthened by the implicit threat of his country’s economic collapse, which would be a nightmare for China’s leaders, who can easily envision millions of starving refugees flooding over the border. “Buttressing up the Kim Jong-il regime for stability in the North is as important as denuclearizing it,” said Mr. Choi, the analyst. Chinese state media reported on Thursday that China and North Korea planned to start building twohydroelectricdams this year on the Yalu River, which serves as their border. The dams will cost about $161 million and generate 308 million kilowatt hours of electricity for North Korea and the northeastern Chinese province of Jilin. China is also considering investments to build bridges and renovate roads and railways in North Korea to tap its rich natural resources and use its ports, according to South Korean news reports and analysts. For its part, South Korea wants China and the United States to focus more on dismantling the North’s nuclear weapons. A nuclear North Korea increases investors’ risks in South Korea, leaves the South more dependent on the benevolence of the United States’ nuclear umbrella and makes a unified Korea a more distant dream, officials here say. At the same time, if the North does not get any help from China or South Korea, “it might launch a desperate provocation against the South,” Kim Young-soo, a North Korea expert at Sogang University in Seoul, said at a recent seminar. Fears of such a situation increased last week, when a South Korean Navy ship sank in a mysterious explosion in waters disputed by North Korea, possibly after being hit by a North Korean torpedo or mine, the defense minister, Kim Tae-young, told South Korea’s National Assembly on Friday.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreasaid Friday that its differences with the United States had been diminished during the visit this week of President Obama’s special envoy, but that it needed more talks before deciding whether to return to six-nation nuclear disarmament talks. “Through businesslike and candid talks, both sides deepened mutual understandings, narrowed differences in their respective views and identified not a small number of things in common,” an unidentified spokesman for North Korea’s Foreign Ministry said, according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency. “Both sides agreed to continue to cooperate to narrow the remaining differences.” Stephen W. Bosworth, Mr. Obama’s envoy, released a similar assessment of his three-day visit to North Korea, which ended Thursday. He said that North Korea and the United States shared an understanding of the necessity but not the timing of reconvening six-nation talks and carrying outa 2005 agreementto dismantle the North’snuclear weaponsprograms. “We identified some common understandings on the need for and a role of six-party talks and the importance of implementation of the 2005 joint statement,” Mr. Bosworth said at a news conference in Seoul on Thursday. But, he said, “it remains to be seen when and how” North Korea will return to talks. He said that the talks — the Obama administration’s first senior-level negotiations with the North Korean government — were “exploratory” and that it would take more consultation with the other nations inthe six-nation talksbefore it would be clear when the North would rejoin the discussions. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton told reporters in Washington that “for a preliminary meeting it was quite positive.” Although the North has indicated that it may return to the six-nation meetings, it has also insisted on a new track of bilateral talks with the United States to negotiate the normalization of diplomatic relations and a peace treaty to replace the truce that ended the Korean War in 1953. The North said it would not give up its nuclear arms until it believed that the United States was no longer “hostile.” Mr. Bosworth said that once the six-nation talks reconvened and gained “a significant traction” on denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, the United States and its allies would be ready to discuss the incentives offered in the 2005 agreement: economic aid, security guarantees, normalized relations with Washington and a peace treaty. After a stop in South Korea, Mr. Bosworth was heading to China, Japan and Russia to brief officials. Those four countries have been the other participants in the six-nation talks. Mr. Bosworth updated South Korean officials on the talks with North Korea’s first vice foreign minister, Kang Sok-ju, who is considered the main architect of his country’s nuclear policy and one of the closest aides to North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-il. Mr. Bosworth also met with the North’s chief negotiator, Kim Kye-gwan. Mr. Bosworth’s visit was meant to help Washington decide whether it should maintain sanctions or switch to engagement to prod North Korea toward giving up its nuclear weapons. American and South Korean officials remain unconvinced that the North would give up its nuclear weapons, fearing that it wants to use a new round of talks to escape sanctions and obtain aid. North Korea has struggled to maintain control of its economy, most recently by revaluing its currency. In the past year, North Korea has tested ballistic missiles and a long-range rocket, detonated a nuclear device and reactivated its plutonium production plant. It has also declared that it began enriching uranium for possible use in nuclear weapons. But recently, it has begun to reach out. On Thursday, in a rare admission of a domestic problem and a sign of new openness, North Korea accepted a South Korean offer to send itswine flumedication, South Korean officials said. A day earlier, the North acknowledged nine cases of H1N1 influenza in Pyongyang, the capital, and Sinuiju.

SEOUL — The North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, told the visiting prime minister of China that his government was ready to return to six-nation talks on itsnuclear weaponsprogram if it sees progress in bilateral talks with the United States, state-run media inNorth Koreaand China said Tuesday. Meanwhile, North Korea was “close to completing” the restoration of its main nuclear facilities in Yongbyon, the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported Tuesday, quoting an unidentified government source. The government in Seoul could not immediately confirm the Yonhap report. In an angry reaction to United Nations sanctions earlier this year, North Korea said it would restore the Yongbyon complex, previously mothballed under a deal with Washington. The complex, 62 miles north of the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, is the North’s only known source of weapons-grade plutonium. Along with its uranium enrichment program, the Yongbyon facility also serves as North Korea’s main negotiating card as the regime has begun reaching out to the United States for a new round of one-on-one talks. Mr. Kim’s commitment to the Chinese prime minister, Wen Jiabao, who is on a highly publicized trip to Pyongyang, reverses North Korea’s previous stance that the six-nation talks were “dead,” and also clears a major hurdle for the United States to engage North Korea. But Mr. Kim’s insistence on bilateral talks with Washington reiterates the North’s longstanding strategy of handling its nuclear dispute largely as a matter between it and the United States. Washington said recently it was open to direct talks with the North to coax it back to six-party talks, which include the two Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the United States. “We expressed our readiness to hold multilateral talks, depending on the outcome” of talks with the United States, said the North’s state-run news agency, K.C.N.A., in a dispatch about a Kim-Wen meeting on Monday. “The six-party talks are also included in the multilateral talks.” “The hostile relations between the D.P.R.K. and the United States should be converted into peaceful ties through the bilateral talks without fail,” the news agency also quoted Mr. Kim as saying, using the acronym for the North’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. “Our efforts to attain the goal of denuclearizing the peninsula remain unchanged.” Mr. Kim’s comments were also reported Tuesday by Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency. While North Korea had issued similar statements before, Mr. Kim’s latest comments provided the clearest sign yet that Pyongyang was eager to return to the negotiating table after months of rising tensions over its nuclear and missile tests earlier this year. But that process, analysts say, is bound to be complicated. North Korea has repeatedly used negotiations over ending its nuclear weapons program as a way of extracting aid and diplomatic concessions from the outside world. Mr. Wen arrived in Pyongyang on Sunday to celebrate the 60th anniversary of formal ties between the two communist allies. But his trip has also been cast as a mission to persuade North Korea to return to the disarmament talks. China offered an unspecified amount of aid to the North during Mr. Wen’s trip, according to K.C.N.A.

Despite the relief over the freeing of two U.S. journalists, the Clinton mission has long-term implications.

==::==
Amidst the widespread relief that the two American journalists have avoided the brutal fate meted out to them by a North Korean court, it may seem captious to consider the long-term implications. The impulse to save two young women from 12 years of hard labor  in a North Korean gulag is powerful. Yet now that this goal has been achieved, we need to balance the emotions of the moment against the precedent for the future. It is inherent in hostage situations that potentially heartbreaking human conditions are used to overwhelm policy judgments. Therein, in fact, lies the bargaining strength of the hostage-taker. On the other hand, at any given moment, several million Americans reside or travel abroad. How are they best protected? Is the lesson of this episode that any ruthless group or government can demand a symbolic meeting with a prominent American by seizing hostages or threatening inhuman treatment for prisoners in their hands? If it should be said that North Korea is a special case because of its nuclear capability, does that create new incentives for proliferation? Context matters. It is less than six months since Pyongyang conducted a nuclear test and resumed the production of weapons-grade plutonium in violation of an agreement signed at the six-power conference in Beijing in February 2007. North Korea refused a visit by the new U.S. envoy charged with discussing its proliferation efforts. Pyongyang has rejected various U.N. Security Council resolutions to desist from these activities and to return to the six-party talks. A visit by a former president, who is married to the secretary of state, will enable Kim Jong-il to convey to North Korea, and perhaps to other countries, that his country is being accepted into the international community  —  the precise opposite of what the U.S. secretary of state has defined as the goal of U.S. policy until Pyongyang abandons its nuclear weapons program. Already speculation is rife that the Clinton visit inaugurates the prospect of a change of course of American policy and of a bilateral U.S.-North Korea solution. But two-party talks outside the six-party framework never made any sense. North Korean nuclear weapons threaten its neighbors more than the United States. The other members of the six-party talks are needed to help enforce any agreement that may be made or to sustain sanctions on the way to it. These countries should not be made to feel that the United States uses them as pawns for its global designs. To be sure, the administration has disavowed any intentions for separate, two-power talks. But the other parties will be tempted to hedge against the prospect that these assurances may be modified. That feeling is likely to be particularly strong in Japan, where a national election campaign is taking place and which feels it has secured inadequate support on behalf of Japanese abducted by North Korea. The pains the administration has taken to cast the Clinton mission as a private, humanitarian visit  and the restrained manner in which it was conducted demonstrate an awareness of those risks. Though the distinction between private and public is likely to prove elusive when it concerns a former president and spouse of the secretary of state, the administration is still in a position to achieve a beneficent long-term outcome. The root cause of our decade-old controversy with Pyongyang is that there is no middle ground between North Korea being a nuclear weapons state and a non-nuclear weapons state. At the end of a negotiation, North Korea will either destroy its nuclear arsenal, or it will become a de facto nuclear state. So far, it has used the negotiating forums available to it in a skillful campaign of procrastination, alternating leaps in technological progress with negotiating phases to consolidate it. We seem to be approaching such a consolidating phase now. North Korea may return to its well-established tactic of diverting us with the prospect of imminent breakthroughs. This is exactly what happened after the last Korean nuclear weapons test in 2006. Pyongyang undoubtedly will continue to seek to achieve de facto acceptance as a nuclear weapons state by endlessly protracted diplomacy. The benign atmosphere by which it culminated its latest blackmail must not tempt us or our partners into bypaths that confuse atmosphere with substance. Any outcome other than the elimination of the North Korean nuclear military capability in a fixed time period is a blow to non-proliferation prospects worldwide and to peace and stability globally.

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton had proposed sending various people to lobby for the release of two journalists before Bill Clinton emerged as the preferred choice, people briefed on the talks said.

WASHINGTON — Former PresidentBill ClintonleftNorth Koreaon Wednesday morning after a dramatic 20-hour visit, in which he won the freedom of two American journalists, opened a diplomatic channel to North Korea’s reclusive government and dined with the North’s ailing leader, Kim Jong-il. Mr. Clinton departed from Pyongyang, the capital, around 8:30 a.m. local time, along with the journalists,Laura Ling, 32, andEuna Lee, 36, on a private jet bound for Los Angeles, according to a statement from the former president’s office. The North Korean government, which in June sentenced the women to12 years of hard laborfor illegally entering North Korean territory, announced hours earlier that it had pardoned the women after Mr. Clinton apologized to Mr. Kim for their actions, according to the North Korean state media. President Obama contacted the families of the women on Tuesday evening, according to administration officials, but the White House said it would withhold public comment until the former president landed on American soil. Mr. Clinton’s mission to Pyongyang was the most visible by an American in nearly a decade. It came at a time when the United States’ relationship with North Korea had become especially chilled, after North Korea’stest of its second nuclear devicein May and a series of missile launchings. It ended a harrowing ordeal for the two women, who werestopped on March 17by soldiers near North Korea’s border with China while researching a report about women and human trafficking. They faced years of imprisonment in the gulaglike confines of a North Korean prison camp. And it catapulted Mr. Clinton back on to the global stage, on behalf of a president who defeated his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, in a bitter primary campaign last year, and who later asked her to be his secretary of state. Mrs. Clinton was deeply involved in the case, too. She proposed sending various people to Pyongyang — including Mr. Clinton’s vice president, Al Gore — to lobby for the release of the women, before Mr. Clinton emerged as the preferred choice of the North Koreans, people briefed on the talks said. About 10 days ago, these people said, Mr. Gore, who co-foundedCurrent TV, the San Francisco-based media company that employs Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee, called Mr. Clinton to ask him to undertake the trip. Mr. Clinton agreed, as long as the Obama administration did not object. The riveting tableau of a former president, jetting into a diplomatic crisis while his wife wasembarking on a tour of Africain her role as the nation’s chief diplomat, underscored the unique and enduring role of the Clintons, even in the Obama era. The trip came just two weeks after North Korea issueda harsh personal attackon Mrs. Clinton, in response to comments she made comparing its nuclear test and missile launchings to the behavior of an attention-seeking teenager. The North Korean Foreign Ministry objected  to her “vulgar remarks” and called her “a funny lady” who was neither intelligent nor diplomatic. “Sometimes she looks like a primary-school girl and sometimes a pensioner going shopping,” a spokesman said. The episode evidently did not stop consideration of sending her husband as an envoy. But the initiative was cloaked in secrecy and came after weeks of back-channel talks between the United States and North Korea through its United Nations mission. In addition to Mr. Gore, the White House’s list of potential candidates included Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico. North Korea signaled its desire to have Mr. Clinton act as a special envoy in conversations with Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee, who relayed that message to their families in the middle of July, according to a senior administration official. The message was passed to Mr. Gore, who contacted the White House, which then explored whether such a mission would be successful. Mr. Obama did not speak directly with Mr. Clinton before the mission. But his national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, contacted the former president to sound him out. The senior official said the administration did “due diligence” with the North Koreans to ensure that if Mr. Clinton went, he would return with the journalists. He also denied that Mr. Clinton apologized as a condition of obtaining the pardons from the government. As president, Mr. Clinton had sent Mr. Kim a letter of condolence on the death of his father, Kim Il-sung, according to a former official. For Mr. Kim, the former official said, freeing the women was a “reciprocal humanitarian gesture.” Mr. Kim is believed to have suffered a stroke last year. American officials said they thought his declining health had set off a succession struggle, complicating the Obama administration’s dealings with the North. The families of the American journalists issued a statement saying they were “overjoyed” by news of the pardon and thanked Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton. “We especially want to thank President Bill Clinton for taking on such an arduous mission and Vice President Al Gore for his tireless efforts to bring Laura and Euna home,” the statement said. Current TVsaid in a statement that it too was “overjoyed” and that the hearts of its employees went out to Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee for “persevering through this horrible experience.” The Obama administration said Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee were in good health. Administration officials said Mr. Clinton went to North Korea as a private citizen, did not carry a message from Mr. Obama for Mr. Kim and had the authority to negotiate only for the women’s release. “This was 100 percent about the journalists,” said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter. “We knew Kim Jong-il would probably seek a meeting with Clinton. But that’s not what this visit was about.” Still, North Korea, clearly seeing a propaganda opportunity at home and a rare chance for a measure of favorable publicity abroad, welcomed Mr. Clinton with the fanfare of a state visit. It broadcast a group portrait, as well as photos of Mr. Kim gesturing and talking to Mr. Clinton; of the former president accepting flowers from a North Korean girl; and of Mr. Clinton, seated across a negotiating table from Mr. Kim, each flanked by their aides. Among those greeting Mr. Clinton at the airport was Kim Kye-gwan, North Korea’s chief nuclear negotiator. Among those accompanying Mr. Clinton was David Straub, a former director of the Korea desk at the State Department, who had held talks with the North Koreans through what is known as the “New York connection.” Also on hand was John Podesta, an informal adviser to the Obama administration who served as Mr. Clinton’s chief of staff in the final years of his presidency, when the former president yearned to travel to North Korea to clinch a deal that would have curbed its nuclear program. That visit never happened — partly because the White House concluded that a deal was not assured — and President George W. Bush put the brakes on direct talks with North Korea, setting the stage for eight years of largely fruitless efforts to stop the North’s nuclear ambitions. Given Mr. Clinton’s stature and his long interest in the North Korean nuclear issue, experts said it was likely that his discussions in North Korea ranged well beyond obtaining the release of Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee. “It would be someplace between surprising and shocking if there wasn’t some substantive discussion between the former president, who is deeply knowledgeable about the nuclear issue, and Kim Jong-il,” said Robert L. Gallucci, who negotiated with North Korea in the Clinton administration. Mr. Clinton has sought to find the right place in the Obama era, eager to play a role without stepping on the toes of the new president or certainly of his secretary of state. The last time the two spoke, said the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, was in March, when Mr. Obama invited Mr. Clinton to a ceremony in Washington for signing legislation expanding the AmeriCorps program created by Mr. Clinton. In interviews last spring, Mr. Clinton said that he would be happy to do anything Mr. Obama asked him to do, but that “I try to stay out of their way.” Mr. Clinton’s  mission may be less of an issue for Mr. Obama than for Mrs. Clinton. The same day he landed in North Korea, she arrived in Kenya, kicking off an 11-day journey through Africa — a visit now largely eclipsed by her husband’s travels.

Kim Jong-il has pancreatic cancer and the illness is life-threatening, the South Korean broadcaster YTN said.
==::==
2009-07-13T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — The North Korean leaderKim Jong-il, who suffered a stroke last August, was also found to have “life-threatening” pancreatic cancer around the same time, a South Korean cable television network reported on Monday. The network, YTN, a cable news channel, quoted unidentified Chinese and South Korean intelligence sources for the report, which was made by YTN’s Beijing-based correspondent. YTN did not explain how the sources obtained such medical information about Mr. Kim fromNorth Korea, an isolated, nuclear-armed state that historically has kept details of its leader’s health a closely guarded secret. But if the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is true, Mr. Kim may not have much longer to live. Pancreatic cancer is one of the most difficult cancers to detect early, it spreads rapidly and the fatality rate is high. The World Health Organization says fewer than 5 percent of patients with pancreatic cancer live longer than five years. Although Mr. Kim began making occasional public appearances a few months after he mysteriously disappeared last August, photographs of him and television images recently carried by the North Korean media showed him limping and frail. Mr. Kim’s loss of weight, in particular, has elevated speculation about the severity and nature of what is wrong with him. His health and who is going to succeed him at the top of one of the world’s most secretive states are most intensely monitored issues. Mr. Kim looked gaunt during a public appearance last Wednesday at a memorial for his father, the founder of North Korea, Kim Il-sung. Mr. Kim inherited power after his father died in 1994 at the age of 82. American intelligence officials said last fall that Mr. Kim was seriously ill, although the exact nature of his illnesses has been a matter of speculation. A French neurosurgeon who has treated Mr. Kim said the North Korean leader did have a stroke last August. In December, the doctor, François-Xavier Roux, told Le Figaro, the French daily newspaper: “Kim Jong-il suffered a stroke but did not undergo an operation. He is now better.” Mr. Kim’s health is a topic of intense international interest, in large part because world leaders and governments are unclear about who would succeed him. North Korea is one of the world’s most unpredictable nations, and any transfer of power will focus new attention on the security of its nuclear arsenal. In May, North Korea tested its second nuclear device in a move that shocked and angered the international community. Even China, the North’s closest ally, condemned the test. Mr. Kim has three known sons, and in recent months there have been widespread reports — many of them thinly sourced — that the youngest son, Kim Jong-un, has been designated the heir apparent.

Seven missiles were fired into the sea between North Korea and Japan, flouting a United Nations resolution.
==::==
2009-07-04T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreafired three missiles into the sea between the Communist state and Japan on Saturday morning, the South Korean military announced. News reports here called them ballistic Scud or Rodong missiles. The South Korean military declined to clarify what types of missiles the North had fired. But if the reports were correct, the North Korean tests on Saturday were bound to raise tensions between the North and its neighbors. After anuclear testby North Korea on May 25, the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution that, among other things, barred it from testing ballistic missiles. A South Korean military official, speaking on condition of anonymity citing government policy, said the missiles launched Saturday were believed to have flown no more than 300 miles, indicating that they might be the North’s Scud-type missiles. The South Korean news agency Yonhap quoted military sources as saying the missiles were either Scud or Rodong missiles. A statement from the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said the military was “fully ready to counter any North Korean threats and provocations based on strong South Korea-U.S. combined defense posture.” The latest launchings came on July 4. The North has a record of timing missile tests to coincide with Independence Day in the United States, as a way of highlighting the provocative gestures. Pyongyang fired off a barrage of missiles, including a long-range Taepodong-2, on the Fourth of July in 2006. The Taepodong launching was a failure, with the projectile falling into the sea less than a minute after blastoff. The United States is currently is leading international efforts to enforce the United Nations resolution, which calls for a global embargo on arms trade with the North. North Korea has responded by declaring that it would conduct more missile and nuclear tests. Speculation has been running high in South Korea and Japan that the North might launch more missiles in coming days. It had warned shipping to stay away from its east coast through July 10. North Korea launched arocket on April 4, in what was widely considered another test of Taepodong-2, designed to be an intercontinental missile capable of carrying a warhead as far as the West Coast of the United States. Attention has been focused on whether the North would attempt to launch another intercontinental missile, as it has said it would in the wake of the United Nations  sanctions. But so far, spy satellites have not detected any signs of preparing a Taepodong launching, South Korean officials said in recent days. The United States chief of naval operations, Adm. Gary Roughead, said Saturday that the American military was ready for any North Korean missile tests. "Our ships and forces here are prepared for the tracking of the missiles and observing the activities that are going on,” he said in Tokyo after meeting with Japanese military officials in Tokyo, according to The Associated Press.

The new sanctions adopted by the United Nations Security Council must be enforced if there is any chance of deterring more dangerous actions by North Korea.
==::==
2009-06-17T00:00:00Z
==::==
North Korea is developing a frightening track record of making good on its threats. True to its word, in recent weeks it has conducted a second nuclear test  and several missile tests. It also may have resumed making fuel for nuclear weapons. And the threats keep coming. Over the weekend, the North vowed to make more nuclear weapons and to take “resolute military actions” against efforts to isolate it. Whether new sanctions adopted unanimously by the United Nations Security Council can deter even more dangerous actions is anyone’s guess. We know there is no chance if they are not implemented. The resolution leaves a lot of room for governments to avoid enforcement should they choose. The resolution bars North Korea from selling weapons (ballistic missiles and parts are exports) or buying them. It authorizes states — but does not require them — to inspect cargo vessels and airplanes suspected of carrying North Korean weapons or nuclear technology. The North has sold missiles to Iran and other unsavory customers and a nuclear reactor to Syria. It also calls on — but does not require — states and financial institutions to stop providing banking services, loans and credits that could support its nuclear or missile programs. That could have the biggest impact, if countries and banks heed the call. It is encouraging that China, North Korea’s top supplier of food and fuel, and Russia were heavily involved in drafting the resolution. China’s ambassador endorsed what he called the international community’s “firm opposition” to the North’s nuclear ambitions. But talk is cheap. China and Russia exposed their continued ambivalence by blocking efforts to make certain elements of the new sanctions mandatory. China also insisted on carving out an exception so that it could continue selling small arms to the North. No one has more influence with the North Koreans than China, but it has repeatedly blocked tough sanctions for fear of destabilizing the North and unleashing a flood of refugees. The Obama administration is doing its part. It has said that it would confront any ship suspected of carrying banned items and is exploring new ways to squeeze the North financially. After all that has happened, administration officials are understandably skeptical that any negotiated deal is possible. And they are right to insist that they will not keep paying the North to live up to commitments it has repeatedly made and then reneged on. But they are also right to leave the door open to negotiations. After meeting on Tuesday with South Korea’s president, Lee Myung-bak, President Obama called a nuclear-armed North Korea a “grave threat.” He also said that the North had “another path available”  and that it could still come in from the diplomatic cold if it returns to the bargaining table and abandons its nuclear ambitions. This is a very dangerous time. As the pressure mounts, no one can be sure how North Korea’s erratic leaders will respond. But it would be even more dangerous to allow the North to churn out more nuclear weapons or sell them to the highest bidder. The United States and the other powers, starting with China, must use all of their influence to head off the worst.

North Korea confirmed that it had detained two American journalists on charges of “illegally intruding” into the Communist state through its border with China.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreaconfirmed Saturday that it had detained two American journalists on charges of “illegally intruding” into the North through its border with China. The journalists, Laura Ling, a Chinese-American, and Euna Lee, a Korean-American, both working for Current TV, were on a reporting trip along the border when they were detained by North Korean border guards, according to human rights activists and a South Korean news report. Their colleague, Mitch Koss, and their Chinese guide were reported to have been detained by Chinese border guards. “A competent organ is now investigating the case,” the North’s official news agency, KCNA, said. The terse dispatch, which gave no details, was the first confirmation by North Korea of the arrests. On Friday, Washington said that Secretary of StateHillary Rodham Clintonwas trying to free the two journalists, who had traveled to the border area to report on North Korean refugees in China, according to Chun Ki-won, a Christian clergyman in Seoul who helped arrange their trip. Their arrest complicates Washington’s already thorny relations with the North, including an increase in tensions over North Korea’s plan to launch a satellite between April 4 and April 8. American officials say they believe that the rocket launching is a cover for testing ballistic missile technology. Also Saturday, the North told international aviation authorities that it would close two international air routes through its airspace from April 4 to April 8 for the satellite launching, according to the Japanese and South Korean governments. It remains unclear under what circumstances Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee were detained. The Chosun Ilbo, South Korea’s leading newspaper, reported Saturday that the American television crew appeared to have crossed the river border — either intentionally or not — while trying to get a closer shot of North Korea. Citing Chinese sources on the border, the newspaper reported that the three American journalists and their Chinese guide, an ethnic Korean, crossed the border around sunrise on Tuesday near Tumen, a Chinese border city. The Tumen River, which forms the border, is only 20 or 30 yards wide in the area, according to human rights advocates who have visited there. Much of the river bed is dry, and the shallow water is frozen at this time of the year. It is difficult to tell where the border lies, and North Korean guards often stay hidden in bunkerlike guard posts, they said. The two men in the group, Mr. Koss and the guide, who was not identified, freed themselves from the armed North Korean soldiers and ran back to China, while the two women were overpowered, The Chosun Ilbo reported. Current TV, based in San Francisco, was founded by former Vice President Al Gore.

Kim Jong-il, North Korea’s leader, is probably hospitalized but still capable of making decisions, Japan’s prime minister, Taro Aso, said Tuesday.

==::==
TOKYO —Kim Jong-il,North Korea’s leader, is probably hospitalized but still capable of making decisions, Japan’s prime minister, Taro Aso, said Tuesday. Citing intelligence reports, Mr. Aso said in a parliamentary session that “there are reports he has been hospitalized.” “However, it’s not believed that he is completely incapable of making decisions,” Mr. Aso said, answering an opposition lawmaker’s question during an exchange on foreign affairs and defense. If Mr. Kim, 66, had been incapable of decision-making, Japanese and other intelligence officials believe, “we would be seeing different developments” in North Korea, Mr. Aso said. In a separate assessment of Mr. Kim’s health on Tuesday, the intelligence chief for South Korea’s conservative government said in a closed parliamentary session in Seoul that the leader appeared to be recovering quickly. According to Yonhap News, Kim Sung-ho, the director of the National Intelligence Service, told lawmakers that the North Korean leader had recovered enough to start performing his daily duties. Previous reports said he might have suffered a stroke. That report came the same day that North Korea threatened to reduce South Korea to “debris” if it did not stop its “smear” campaign. The government was apparently enraged that Seoul had done  nothing to stop human rights advocates from dropping anti-Kim leaflets from balloons flying over North Korean territory. Although Mr. Aso did not provide further details about the North Korean leader’s condition, his comments were a rare instance of a national leader speculating  publicly about Mr. Kim’s health. They did not seem to relate to any domestic political considerations, but Japanese leaders were upset this month when the Bush administration removed North Korea from the State Department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism. Tokyo has long wanted to use the promise of removal from the terrorism list as leverage to force North Korea to be more forthcoming about the fate of Japanese citizens who were abducted many years ago. The prospect that the six-nation talks, in which Japan is participating, on dismantling the North’s nuclear program could be completed without resolving the abduction issue is anathema to the Japanese. Mr. Kim’s health, long a topic of intense speculation outside North Korea, has been a  focus of intelligence officials since he failed to attend a celebration last month of the 60th anniversary of the founding of North Korea. American and other officials said that he had possibly suffered a stroke and was under the care of doctors in the capital, Pyongyang, raising fears about instability in the North, a nuclear power. North Korea has denied that Mr. Kim is ill. According to North Korean media,  Mr. Kim has made public appearances since his absence from last month’s celebration. But experts have raised doubts about the date of one photograph supposedly showing Mr. Kim.

North Korealifted its ban onUnited Nationsinspections of the plant that produced plutonium used in  a nuclear test and announced that it would resume deactivating a related nuclear facility within days, theInternational Atomic Energy Agencysaid Monday. The decisions were disclosed in an internal agency memo that was obtained by The Associated Press. The memo was a strong indication that North Korea was making good on its pledge to return to an international agreement in which it had promised to dismantle its nuclear weapons program in exchange for political concessions and energy aid. The change of heart came on Sunday after the United States removed the country from its list of states sponsoring terrorism.

North Korea fired short-range missiles off the country’s western coast, South Korean media reported.
==::==
2008-10-09T00:00:00Z

SEOUL, South Korea  —North Koreafired short-range missiles off the country’s western coast this week, , South Korean media reported Wednesday, a move that comes amid tensions raised by its efforts to reassemble part of its nuclear facilities. Several news organizations reported the launches, but offered differing details. South Korea’s Yonhap news agency, quoting an unnamed government source, reported that the .North  had launched two missiles on Tuesday toward international waters between the North and China. Chosun Ilbo, a mass-circulation daily in Seoul, also quoting an unnamed government source, reported that North Korea launched  an unknown number of missiles from a naval base in Chodo, an island about 60 miles southwest of the North Korea capital, Pyongyang. It said the missiles were either KN-01 land-to-sea missiles or Styx ship-to-ship missiles. North Korea has deployed more missiles around Chodo  and declared it a no-go zone, meaning that it may launch more missiles to mark the Oct. 10 anniversary of the ruling Workers Party of Korea, the newspaper  quoted the government source as saying. But another mass-circulation newspaper, JoongAng Ilbo, said  two missiles were fired  Tuesday and said they were air-to-ship missiles launched from an IL-28 North Korean bomber. The South Korean military would not confirm the launches. A spokesman at the office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, asking for  anonymity under normal ground rules, said,  “We cannot confirm these reports because it’s an intelligence matter.” South Korea usually dismisses short-range missile tests by the North as part of routine military exercises. But analysts say that the North tests  missiles when it wants to escalate tensions to strengthen  its bargaining position. In March, North Korea test-fired a barrage of short-range missiles off its western coast, while threatening to slow down work to  disable its nuclear weapons facilities in Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang, work it had agreed to as part of a hard-won international agreement. North Korea stopped disabling the Yongbyon complex in August, angry that it had not been removed  from the United States’  list of state sponsors of terrorism. Last month, North Korea began reassembling the facilities used to produce weapons-grade plutonium from spent nuclear fuel rods. Christopher R. Hill, the senior  American envoy for North Korea, visited Pyongyang last week to try to find a way to salvage the disarmament deal. North Korea conducted its only  nuclear test in October 2006.  It is unknown whether the North has the technology to arm its missiles with nuclear warheads. North Korea has a large arsenal of missiles, including ballistic weapons  whose range includes  all of South Korea and Japan. Missile experts say that the North is also developing a long-range  missile series, called Taepodong,  that would be  able  to reach parts of North America.

That a stream of the New York Philharmonic’s performance made its way out over the Internet was nothing short of amazing.

It would of course have been fascinating to attend theNew York Philharmonic’s concert on Tuesday night at the East Pyongyang Grand Theater in North Korea. Daniel J. Wakin, a  reporter for The New York Times, was there to cover this breakthrough event, the first performance by an American orchestra in that totalitarian country. Yet, in a way, the potential (if any) of this concert to thaw the icy relations between North Korea and the United States may have come through even better in the live relay that I watched at home on my desktop computer. The performance was streamed at 4 a.m. Eastern time on  Tuesday on thePBS-WNET Web site.  (A broadcast in conventional fashion was scheduled for Tuesday night at 8 in the New York area as part of the “Great Performances” series on WNET, and showings on other PBS stations will follow later in the week.) In negotiating with the North Korean government for this 48-hour stop on its Asian tour, the New York Philharmonic and its music director, Lorin Maazel, insisted that the concert in Pyongyang be broadcast within the country and beyond. It is hard to know how many North Koreans were actually able to see it. Still, that the performance made its way over the Internet was nothing short of amazing. For music lovers in the New York area who have grown familiar with the Philharmonic players, it was affecting to see them take their places onstage in the recently renovated  modern   concert hall in Pyongyang, as the audience applauded warmly. There were immediate close-up images of the assistant concertmaster, Michelle Kim; she  left South Korea for America as a child with her parents, who had fled the North during the war. But the knowing cameras also singled out Glenn Dicterow, the affable veteran concertmaster; Carter Brey, the elegant principal cellist; and the young Joseph Pereira, a versatile percussionist, as they assumed their roles as cultural ambassadors to this isolated country where the news media are strenuously controlled. Extremes of political opinion have been expressed about the Philharmonic’s decision to accept this invitation. I was touched by the comments of one Philharmonic player, quoted in The Associated Press, who felt bad that the orchestra would be playing for an audience of Pyongyang elites, while so many North Koreans lack the basics of food, heat and electricity. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, an accomplished pianist, brought some cool diplomatic perspective to the concert in a statement last week. “I don’t think we should get carried away with what listening to Dvorak is going to do in North Korea,” she said. Still, to judge from the streamed version, Lorin Maazel and the Philharmonic did very well by Dvorak on Tuesday night, giving a full-bodied, vibrantly characterized performance of the “New World” Symphony. Mr. Maazel switched easily between the roles of towering maestro and gracious host. Introducing the pieces in English (relying on an  interpreter), he tossed in a few welcoming phrases in Korean that drew appreciative laughter and applause from the audience. What the Philharmonic played was just as important as how it played. Here Mr. Maazel’s tame choices represented missed opportunities. Presenting the “New World” Symphony made a point, of course. As Mr. Maazel explained, the piece, commissioned by the Philharmonic, was a Czech composer’s symphonic ode to America. And there were valid reasons to include Gershwin’s sassy, jazzy “American in Paris.” Someday, Mr. Maazel said, maybe someone will compose a piece called “Americans in Pyongyang.” If only he had chosen to include even one short work by a living American composer, perhaps an Asian-American composer. Because the orchestra stuck  to staples, the classical music art form came off as unthreatening. New music, by definition, is destabilizing. To have a composer taking part in the program would have been a reminder that the heritage is living, breathing and unpredictable. Instead Mr. Maazel began with Wagner’s prelude to Act III of “Lohengrin.” Wagner’s career rather undermines the case for the humanizing powers of music. Here was a nasty man who somehow wrote sublime and stirring operas. Still, the concert was historic. And the image of a major American orchestra as a sleek machine under the control of an imposing conductor was nicely countered by the second encore: the overture to Bernstein’s “Candide,” which, as Mr. Maazel explained, was played by the musicians without a conductor as a tribute to its beloved composer. After the final encore, an arrangement of a wistful Korean folk song, “Arirang,” the audience stood, cheered and even waved farewell to the musicians. Many of the players visibly choked up, and waved back. It’s a start.

The comments made last week by President Bush’s special envoy on North Korean human rights criticized the current United States diplomatic approach of North Korea.

WASHINGTON — Secretary of StateCondoleezza Rice, in a rare public rebuke, has upbraided a White House envoy who criticized United States diplomacy towardNorth Koreathat is aimed at coaxing the North Koreans to give up their nuclear weapons. Ms. Rice said  the official, Jay Lefkowitz, President Bush’s special envoy on North Korean human rights, was not speaking for the administration when he told an audience at the American Enterprise Institute last week that the United States “should consider a new approach to North Korea” because the current approach was unlikely to resolve the issue before  the end of Mr. Bush’s term   in a year. Speaking to reporters aboard her flight to Berlin on Monday, Ms. Rice sharply disagreed, and said Mr. Lefkowitz should stick to human rights and leave the  talks over the North’s nuclear policy to her, Mr. Bush and the other nations involved: Russia, China, Japan and South Korea. “He’s the human rights envoy,” Ms. Rice said. “That’s what he knows. That’s what he does. He doesn’t work on the six-party talks. He doesn’t know what’s going on in the six-party talks and he certainly has no say in what American policy will be in the six-party talks.” Mr. Lefkowitz, reached at his office in New York,  said he and Ms. Rice spoke on Friday about the disagreement, and he described their conversation as “very amicable, substantive and useful.” “I’m going to have a great deal more to say about elevating the issue of human rights in North Korea, which is clearly a priority for the president and Congress,” he said. The dispute comes at a time when nuclear talks have stalled, with North Korea missing a year-end deadline to disclose all of its nuclear programs. A debate within the administration has fractured along familiar lines, with  hard-line national security hawks in Vice President Dick Cheney’s office and at the White House arguing for a more confrontational approach with the North. On the other side, Mr.  Bush’s lead North Korea nuclear negotiator, Christopher R. Hill, backed by Ms. Rice, has argued that the United States should continue a more restrained approach, one that was widely credited with bringing about an agreement last year intended to eventually lead to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Ms. Rice said that Mr. Bush had “spoken as to what our policy is in the six-party talks.” “I know where the president stands,” she added, “and I know where I stand, and those are the people who speak for American policy.”

Severe flooding has left hundreds dead or missing and inflicted widespread damage, North Korean officials acknowledged on Tuesday.

SEOUL, Aug. 14 — Severe flooding inNorth Koreahas left hundreds dead or missing and inflicted widespread damage, North Korean officials acknowledged today, raising fears of worsening food shortages in an already impoverished land. The rare admission of problems by the reclusive Communist government — and the speed with which it invited United Nations relief agencies like the World Food Program to assess the situation — suggested the gravity of the situation in North Korea, where many people already live on the edge of starvation. “We are very concerned that this flooding is very serious,” said Paul Risley, Asia spokesman with the World Food Program, whose officials were traveling at Pyongyang’s invitation to the affected areas. “They have made a preliminary request for assistance.” South Korea said it is also considering offering emergency aid to its neighbor, although it has not received a formal request from the North. Reports of the flooding in North Korea, a country that is chronically prone to floods and drought, came two weeks before President Roh Moo Hyun of South Korea was scheduled to meet North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Il, in Pyongyang from Aug. 28 to 30. With extensive parts of its farmland destroyed now, economic aid will loom larger in the summit meeting, the first in seven years. “The material damage so far is estimated to be very big,” said the North’s state-run Korean Central News Agency. The agency said the heavy rains, which started a week ago, were known to have destroyed at least 800 public buildings, 540 bridges, 70 sections of railroads and 1,100 vehicles, pumps and electric motors. Hardest hit were four agriculturally productive provinces in central and southern North Korea and the capital, Pyongyang, where some low-lying residential zones were inundated, according to a dispatch by Chosun Sinbo, a pro-North Korean newspaper in Japan. North Korea said “tens of thousands of hectares of farmland” were inundated, buried under silt and washed away. “That will have an effect on this year’s harvest and the ability of farmers to replant those areas,” Mr. Risley said. “This will certainly have an effect on the food available this fall.” Even in a good year, North Korea has a grains shortfall of about one million tons, according to the World Food Program. The damage this month was feared to be greater than that reported in the flooding of July last year, according to Mr. Risley and Suh Sung Woo, a senior official at South Korea’s Unification Ministry who spoke to reporters in Seoul today. “The one really interesting phenomenon now is how quickly North Korea both announced the extent of damages and how quickly they requested assistance from U.N. agencies,” a Western diplomat in Asia familiar with North Korea’s food crisis said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “The government is more open about the situation,” the diplomat said. “This is either an indication that this is a very serious crisis or it is an indication that the government is acting in a more cooperative manner.” During the flooding last year, weeks passed before North Korea acknowledged flood damage and requested outside help. At the time, Chosun Sinbo quoted North Korean sources as saying that the flooding had left 549 people dead and 295 missing, with 28,747 homes destroyed. This time, North Korean officials have told the International Red Cross that 200 people are dead or missing across the country, the agency’s acting delegation head, Terje Lysholm, told The Associated Press from Pyongyang. The Red Cross was able to visit 14 counties, where it counted 2,500 homeless families and is distributing kits of necessities such as blankets, kitchen sets and water purification tablets. Flooding has been a recurring curse in mountainous North Korea, where many hills have been deforested as North Koreans try to create more arable land and collect firewood.

Pyongyang has demanded the return of up to $25 million frozen in a Macau bank before it continues negotiations.
==::==
2007-03-22T00:00:00Z
==::==
BEIJING, March 22  — Talks aimed at dismantlingNorth Korea’s nuclear weapons program stalled here today  over the failure to release up to $25 million frozen in a Macau bank that Pyongyang has demanded be returned before it continues disarmament negotiations. The United States assistant secretary of state, Christopher Hill, said that Chinese officials were working to transfer the money from the Macau bank,  Banco Delta Asia, but that this had been delayed because of unexpected “technical banking issues”. China called a halt to the talks late today  without a date being agreed for the next round of negotiations, although Mr. Hill said a Feb. 13 agreement that the North would shut down its Yongbyon reactor by April 13 in return for economic aid remained on track. He declined to comment on the specific reasons why it was proving difficult to release the money  from accounts linked to North Korea that have been frozen since Washington in September 2005 accused the small, family-owned bank of money-laundering and distributing counterfeit American  currency on behalf of the North. Banco Delta Asia has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Over four days of six-nation talks in the Chinese capital this week, North Korean negotiators refused to discuss arms control until the money was  transferred to an account controlled by the North in the Bank of China, a state-owned Chinese lender. “To me, it highlights the degree of the D.P.R.K.’s isolation that it sometimes proves difficult to return money to them even when everybody wants to see the money returned to them,” Mr. Hill said, referring to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the North’s official name. “It really was an issue of how do you move bank accounts,” he said. Mr. Hill said he expected the money  to be transferred within days, but there was some confusion late today  about how North Korea would get the money and how much of the $25 million it was entitled to have. The president of the Bank of China, Li Lihui, said today  that the bank had not been asked to handle the transaction. “I can tell you that up until now, we were not asked to deal with this business,” he told reporters in Hong Kong today,  The Associated Press reported. Earlier, China’s official Xinhua news agency quoted Russia’s top envoy at the six-party talks, Alexander Losyukov, as saying that the Bank of China had refused to accept the money. But  China’s chief negotiator at the talks, Wu Dawei, who has been closely involved in efforts to transfer the money,  said the Bank of China had concerns about accepting the money and “not all the concerns have been assuaged.” In a statement on its Web site, the Macau monetary authority said it would handle transferring all money  at  Banco Delta Asia according to instructions from the account holders. Still, banking industry analysts said it was unlikely that all account holders would agree to have their money transferred to an account they could not control at  the Bank of China. They also questioned whether the Chinese bank would be comfortable accepting money without question from a bank that the United States has accused of criminal activity. Accounts controlled by about 50 North Korean banks, trading companies and individuals were frozen in Banco Delta Asia along with $7 million in the account of Daedong Credit Bank, North Korea’s only foreign-managed bank. Daedong Credit Bank has said it can prove that the sources of the money  frozen in its account are  legitimate, and it has been lobbying officials in Macau and Washington to have the money released. Colin McAskill, a British businessman in the process of buying the Macau bank, was unavailable for comment. After an 18-month investigation, the United States  Treasury Department on March 14 formally issued a ruling that bans American banks from dealing with Banco Delta Asia, effectively isolating it from the American  financial system. The Treasury Department’s attack on Banco Delta Asia has angered Pyongyang and become a major sticking point in efforts to disarm the North. In answer to a question about whether these moves against the bank had undermined international efforts to disarm North Korea, Mr. Hill said, “This is a long-term question.” He added, “Our country has absolutely no choice but to be vigorous in protection of our financial system.” Soon after the United States  moved against the bank in September 2005, North Korea began boycotting the six-nation talks, and its state-controlled news media carried a host of reports about  demonstrations  in North Korea against the talks. The  North conducted tests of improved ballistic missiles last summer, and then on Oct. 9, test-detonated a nuclear weapon for the first time. Both steps drew angry protests from neighboring nations and the United States. The regime in Pyongyang agreed to return to the talks late last year only after the United States agreed to hold separate negotiations on Banco Delta Asia. As a result of those financial talks, Washington announced on Monday that the frozen funds would be returned to the North by way of the Bank of China, after Pyongyang pledged that the money would be used for humanitarian purposes and education. While only American banks have been formally banned from dealing with Banco Delta Asia, Washington also actively discouraged many international lenders from doing business with the bank, according to financial experts and American officials. Because of those efforts, an informal financial embargo was tightening around the impoverished North, effectively isolating it further from the international banking system. Analysts have said there was no doubt that this led isolation led to economic pain for the North. But the regime focused most of its attention on the frozen funds in Banco Delta Asia, Japanese diplomats following the talks said, even though the sum involved  was fairly small, even for a poor nation like North Korea. The diplomats speculated that some of the frozen money may be the personal funds of top officials in Pyongyang. A senior Japanese diplomat in Beijing this week, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the North’s determination to recover the frozen funds could be a sign that financial sanctions were limiting the leadership’s access to foreign currency, which is used to reward loyal officials with expensive gifts and luxury goods.

To the Editor: Re “The Lesson of North Korea” (editorial, Feb. 14): It appears that the price has been set as to what the rest of the world, including the United States, will pay to get you to give up your nuclear weapons. The only question that remains is whether the price will go up for a government in the Middle East or South America or somewhere else  where a government decides to blackmail the world. The lesson of the deal with North Korea is that nuclear blackmail is a practical means for a tyrant to provide for the people under his thumb. Bill Decker San Diego, Feb. 14, 2007  To the Editor: Instead of celebrating the recent nuclear disarmament agreement between the United States and North Korea, I have reasons to be skeptical: ¶North Korea has broken such agreements in the past, so what makes us think that it will keep the agreement this time? ¶How will the dismantling of its nuclear weapons program be enforced, and how effective will the enforcement be? ¶What will the inspectors be allowed to do? ¶Does North Korea consider this to be only a temporary agreement or a permanent one? I have a bad feeling that the United States and North Korea will be back squabbling before long. Kenneth L. Zimmerman Huntington Beach, Calif. Feb. 14, 2007  To the Editor: Re “Private Talks Held in Berlin Spurred Sides to Reach Deal” (news article, Feb. 14): It’s refreshing to read that diplomacy has deterred North Korea’s aspirations for nuclear weapons. Now we must hope that the same can occur in Iran. It’s obvious from the disaster in Iraq that diplomacy trumps warfare. Sarah Newman Los Angeles, Feb. 14, 2007  To the Editor: You write (“The Lesson of North Korea,” editorial, Feb. 14), “We hope that Mr. Bush learns the most basic lesson of this week’s deal: sometimes you really do have to talk to your enemies, even if you have to grit your teeth.” Speaking of gritting one’s teeth, I could figuratively hear your editorial teeth grind as you said something almost nice about the president. You seem frightened that he might yet “salvage” his presidency. How glad I am to be a political independent and to be pleased when a president, whoever he may be, succeeds. That means the country succeeds. You seem almost angry. Such is the price of making partisanship the first priority.   Ronald M.

A majority of North Korea’s population will face food shortages unless it receives assistance, two agencies warned.
==::==
2010-11-18T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — Despite a relatively good autumn harvest,North Korearemains in dire need offood aid, especially for its youngest children, pregnant women and the elderly, according to twoUnited Nationsagencies. In anew joint report, the World Food Program and the Food and Agriculture Organization said that North Korea, even after substantial imports, would have a shortfall in staple crops — mostly rice, grains and soybeans — of more than half a million tons. The 2010 harvest was 3 percent higher than last year’s, the agencies said, despite an unusually harsh winter and alternating drought and flood conditions over the summer. But even in the best of years, North Korea is unable to feed itself. Government food distribution provides only half the necessary daily calories, the report said. People are thus left to fend for themselves with small hillside plots and kitchen gardens, and by buying food or bartering for it on the black market. Officials have estimated that the food aid program for North Korea is underfinanced by 80 percent and that nearly half the country’s children are malnourished. “I saw a lot of children already losing the battle against malnutrition,” said Josette Sheeran, executive director of the World Food Program, after a visit to North Korea this month. “Their bodies and minds are stunted, and so we really feel the need there.” On another matter affecting North Korea, the South Korean government on Wednesday rejected a North Korean request for talks about restarting cross-border tours to the jointly operated Mount Kumgang resort in the North, also known as Diamond Mountain. The tours, which were suspended by the South in 2008, annually brought millions of dollars of hard currency to the North Korean government. South Korea suspended the resort tours after a South Korean woman was shot and killed there by a North Korean guard, apparently when the woman wandered into a restricted zone. Angered by the suspension of the tours, North Korea responded by seizing several buildings owned by South Korea. The South has demanded a fuller investigation of the shooting as well as more safeguards for its tourists before tours can begin again. In their joint report on food shortages, the United Nations agencies pointed out that agriculture was “the main contributor to the national income” in the North, although its percentage of the gross domestic product has declined in the past decade to 21 percent from 30 percent. A lack of foreign currency and credit, made worse by international sanctions against the government, prevented significant imports of fertilizer and pesticides as well as tires and spare parts for farm trucks and tractors. Inremarks before the Group of 20 summitmeeting in Seoul last week, the secretary general of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, said he had “very serious concerns about the humanitarian situation” in North Korea, “especially for the very young children.” Mr. Ban said the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, had pledged to him that the South would provide humanitarian assistance to the North’s children. North Korea, as a condition for allowing further reunions between families separated by the Korean War, asked the South last month for 500,000 tons of rice and 300,000 tons of fertilizer. The request was denied. The South Korean government did send smallshipments of rice and instant noodlesto the North last month, part of an $8.5 million aid package agreed on earlier by the two countries. Analysts and donors have expressed concern that the food aid from the South will be diverted to the North’s political elite and the military.

A State Department worker, Stephen Jin-Woo Kim, is accused of disclosing classified information to Fox News.
==::==
2010-08-28T00:00:00Z
==::==
WASHINGTON — A federal grand jury in Washington has indicted a State Department analyst suspected of  disclosing top-secret information aboutNorth Koreato Fox News, the third time the Obama administration has filed criminal charges accusing people of leaks to the news media. The indictment, dated Aug. 19 and unsealed on Friday, named Stephen Jin-Woo Kim, 43, of McLean, Va., a specialist in nuclear proliferation who worked as a contractor for the State Department. Mr. Kim, who has worked as a high-level foreign affairs analyst for a decade for various federal agencies, is accused of disclosing the information in June 2009 and of lying to the F.B.I. in September 2009. Mr. Kim, an American citizen, pleaded not guilty on Friday in Federal District Court before Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly and was released on $100,000 bond. A person familiar with the investigation said it involved a Fox News report on North Korea’s likely reaction to a United Nations Security Council resolution, which was then pending, that condemned its nuclear and ballistic missile tests. Fox News said at the time that it was “withholding some details about the sources and methods by which American intelligence agencies learned of the North’s plans.” The charges are part of a crackdown on disclosures of classified information to the news media under President Obama. A former contract linguist for the F.B.I. was sentenced in May to 20 months in prison for disclosing secret documents to a blogger, and a veteran National Security Agency official isawaiting trial on charges of sharing classified information with a reporterfor The Baltimore Sun. In addition, the Justice Department is seeking to question a reporter for The New York Times, James Risen, about his sources for a book about the C.I.A. that describes a program devised to disruptIran’s nuclear weaponsprogram. News media and civil liberties advocates have criticized the prosecutions, noting that Mr. Obama came into office pledging to insist on openness about government operations. Administration officials have said there is no contradiction between the transparency policy and aggressively punishing those who leak secrets. David S. Kris, the assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s national security division, said in a statement that “the willful disclosure of classified information to those not entitled to it is a serious crime.” But Abbe D. Lowell, a lawyer for Mr. Kim, denounced the charges as an attempt to criminalize “the type of government-media exchanges that happen hundreds of times a day in Washington.” He said the charges would “destroy the career” of Mr. Kim, whom he called “a loyal civil servant and brilliant foreign policy analyst.”

As the lowest-ranked of the 32 nations in the field, North Korea faces an imposing challenge. Yet no country enters the tournament with a bigger reputation for doing the unexpected.
==::==
2010-06-02T00:00:00Z

JOHANNESBURG —North Korea’s soccer team arrived Tuesday at the World Cup, where it will be supported by cheerleaders recruited from China, led by a forward born in Japan and prohibited at home from receiving free television coverage provided by fellow competitor and political rival South Korea. There is much intrigue surrounding the mostly unknown team from North Korea. One of the world’s most closed nations will open slightly to participate in the world’s biggest sporting event, even as it is being accused by South Korea ofsinking one of its warshipsin March and killing 46 sailors. As the lowest-ranked of the 32 nations in the field, North Korea faces an imposing challenge to become one of two teams advancing from the so-called Group of Death, which also includes Brazil, a five-time champion; Portugal, a 2006 semifinalist; and the Ivory Coast, an African power led by one of the world’s best forwards, Didier Drogba. Yet no country enters the tournament, which runs from June 11 to July 11, with a bigger reputation for doing the unexpected. North Korea’s last appearance in the World Cup — in 1966 — resulted in one of soccer’s greatest feats,a shocking 1-0 victory over Italy, whose humbled players were reportedly pelted with rotten fruit upon returning home in disgrace. “We have a great desire for success in the tournament,” North Korea’s coach, Kim Jong-hun, said in a brief statement Tuesday. As expected, Kim did not refer to increasing tensions along the 38th parallel. In sporting terms, North and South Korea have a complicated relationship that long predates the sinking of the naval vessel, the Cheonan. Last week, South Korea’s captain, Park Ji-sung, told The Guardian of London, “Maybe we can get closer to North Korea through the World Cup.” Athletes from the two Koreas marched together in the opening ceremony at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Yet North Korea did not even attempt to qualify for the 2002 World Cup, which was jointly hosted by South Korea and Japan. It also ignored an offer by FIFA, soccer’s world governing body, to host a match or two in that tournament. During qualification for this World Cup, a 2008 match with South Korea, scheduled for Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, was moved instead to Shanghai. South Korea had insisted on bringing its own fans, raising its national flag and playing its national anthem, to which the North objected. After losing a 2009 qualifying match by 1-0 to South Korea in Seoul, the North Koreans complained of biased refereeing and tainted food, saying the game “turned into a theater of plot-breeding and swindling.” South Korea’s refusal to beam free World Cup television broadcasts across the demilitarized zone, which it did as a humanitarian gesture in 2006, might not have a dramatic impact. Kim Jong-il, the North Korean leader, would probably not allow any matches to be shown live anyway, considering that the team could be humiliated or someone could hold up a sign of protest against the regime, said Brian Myers, a professor of international studies and an expert on North Korean propaganda at Dongseo University in Pusan, South Korea. If North Korea somehow defeated or tied mighty Brazil, tightly edited snippets of the match — obtained perhaps from China or pirated — would be shown a day or two later, Myers said. Defeats might receive no mention in the state-controlled news media. “I can’t remember reading about North Korea losing a match,” Myers said in a telephone interview. “Occasionally, they show a couple minutes of soccer matches around the world. They might show one of the enemy — like the U.S. or Japan — losing.” Unlike the former East Germany and Soviet Union, which intended athletic achievement as a sign of communist superiority, sports in North Korea serve to burnish nationalism and enhance the cult of personality of Kim Jong-il, said Michael Breen, a British journalist who lives in Seoul and has authored a biography of the leader. That seemed evident when goalkeeper Ri Myong-guk said it was his duty to “safeguard the gates to the fatherland,” and the star forward Jong Tae-se said, “If Kim Jong-il is pleased, I will be honored.” Jong is one of two ethnic Koreans on the North’s roster who were born in Japan. He is a top forward in Japan’s professional league and is nicknamed the People’s Rooney for a stocky build and goal-scoring propensity that remind some of the English star Wayne Rooney. There have been conflicting reports of Jong’s heritage. Some news accounts say he was born to South Korean parents and later renounced his South Korean citizenship. But Jong told reporters recently that his mother is North Korean, his father was born in Japan and that he himself attended Pyongyang-supported schools there. Upon leaving his Japanese club team  to begin World Cup preparations, Jong told reporters in Tokyo that his North Korean teammates were curious about his cellphone, and had passed it among one another. He also vowed to score in each match, adding, “We want to produce results that will stun the world.” Sven-Goran Eriksson, the Ivory Coast coach, cautioned that opponents better be prepared for the relentless, defensively robust North Koreans, saying: “Physically they are better than anyone because they have been in training camp for six months. They are organized, running all the time.” Because so few North Koreans have the money or the permission to leave the country for the World Cup, the nation’s sports committee has recruited about 1,000 Chinese fans as surrogate cheerleaders, including actors and musicians, according to Xinhua, China’s state-run news agency. If North Korea does stun the world, it will not be the first time. At the 1966 World Cup, its army-based team shocked Italy on a lone goal by Pak Do-ik, who later was called the Dentist for inflicting so much hurt on the favored Italians. North Korea then blew a three-goal lead and lost, 5-3, to Portugal in the quarterfinals. Rumors spread that the Koreans had run out of gas after cavorting in Middlesbrough, England, where the Italian match was held, and were later killed or sent to re-education camps for their decadent behavior. But a British filmmaker named Daniel Gordon found the truth to be otherwise in a 2002 documentary about that North Korean team called“The Game of Their Lives.”Players received decent apartments and increased rations for their startling upset, Gordon said in a telephone interview. “It’s possible some prominent players got caught up in factional purges, but I’m not convinced it had to do with 1966,” said Gordon, who has been to North Korea more than 20 times. “As far as them going through bars and cavorting with women, there aren’t any half-Korean children running around Middlesbrough about age 40. That behavior didn’t happen.”

The fate of Pak Nam-gi, who is said to have spearheaded a botched currency reform, became an object of speculation after absences from official functions.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreahas arrested and possibly executed its top financial official as it struggles to contain chaos set off by its botched attempt to halt inflation through a radical currency revaluation, according to news reports Thursday in South Korea. The fate of the official, Pak Nam-gi, the ruling Workers’ Party’s finance and planning department chief, who is said to have spearheaded the currency reform, became a focal point of speculation when he did not  appear at any official functions reported in the North Korean news media for the past two months. But the reclusive nature of the North Korean government has made it nearly impossible to verify reports about high-ranking officials. If the reports about the arrest and execution are true, though, they suggest that the ailing North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, considers the public discontent in the aftermath of the currency reform a serious challenge to his grip on power. Mr. Pak “was executed at a firing range in Pyongyang on the trumped-up charges of being an antirevolutionary element as public sentiments worsened over the failure of the currency reform,” reported the South Korean news agency Yonhap, quoting unnamed sources in North Korea. In late November, North Koreasuddenly told its people that it would introduce new banknotes, ordering them to turn in their old bills for new ones at a rate of 100 to 1. It also put a cap on how much old money they could swap for the new currency. The shock measure was meant to arrest runaway inflation and crack down on illegal markets in the socialist state. But it only aggravated the food crisis, creating shortages and soaring prices, and reportedly led to isolated but highly unusual outbursts of protest in the totalitarian state. South Korea said it could not confirm the reports about Mr. Pak’s execution. Mr. Kim often keeps personnel reshuffles secret, and party officials who have disappeared from official functions and been reported to be dead in the South Korean news media have often resurfaced years later in new jobs. “It’s unusual that Mr. Pak has not been seen in public for two months, and there is speculation about his fate,” said Lee Jong-joo, a spokeswoman at the Unification Ministry in Seoul. “But we don’t have any information about whether he was sacked, arrested or executed by firing squad.” Until Jan. 9, Mr. Pak’s name appeared regularly in the list of officials the North Korean news media reported as accompanying Mr. Kim on inspection tours of factories, farms and military units. Names on the list offer guidance about who is in favor in the North Korean hierarchy. The failed currency reform threatened Mr. Kim’s main policy goal, which was to create at least an impression that its moribund economy would revive by 2012. That is when he is expected to announce one of his three known sons — most likely, according to observers, his youngest son, Jung-un — as his official heir. “The North Korean authorities have tried to reverse their currency policy failure, but they don’t seem to know how,” said Lee Seung-yong, an official at Good Friends, a relief group based in Seoul that collects information from sources within the North. “We have reports that the food situation is getting worse and some people are dying of hunger.” As its state-run stores failed to provide enough food, North Korea recently reversed itself andbegan turning a blind eye to private marketsto resuscitate food supplies. But the markets remain empty, Mr. Lee said. With prices expected to continue to soar, those who have goods are not returning to the markets, he said. Reports that Mr. Pak was executed or arrested were also carried byDaily NKand Free North Korea Radio, both Web sites based in Seoul that rely on informants from North Korea. But others cast doubt. Park Sang-hak, a North Korean defector and head of a Seoul-based advocacy group, Fighters for Free North Korea, said that his informants in North Korea had heard “rumors” that Mr. Pak was either executed or sent to a prison camp. “But so far, our sources haven’t found anyone who says he actually saw this execution,” Mr. Park said. Ha Tae-keung, head of Open Radio for North Korea, which also gathers news from North Korea, agreed. “If they executed him to quell public anger, he must have been executed in public and thousands must have been mobilized to watch it,” Mr. Ha said. North Korea publicly executed Seo Gwan-hee, a party secretary in charge of agriculture, on spying charges in 1997 when a famine decimated the population, according to defectors. But Mr. Kim also banishes confidants embroiled in corruption or policy blunders to remote areas as warnings, only to reinstate them years later, Mr. Park said.

Three provocative new books about North Korea parse the slivers of light that escape this enigmatic and often baffling place.

Computers are rare inNorth Korea, and the Internet, for most of its citizens, is little more than a whispered rumor. It’s probable, in fact, that only one person surfs the Web in North Korea without someone monitoring every click:Kim Jong-il, that authoritarian regime’s supreme leader. When he’s online, and not lurking on sites devoted to his obsessions (movies, fancy food, young women,nuclear weapons), Mr. Kim  must sometimes see what his country looks like, to the rest of the world, in those haunting satellite photographs of the Far East at night. You’ve probably seen them. The countries near North Korea — Japan, South Korea, China — are ablaze with splotches and pinpricks of light, with beaming civilization. But North Korea, a country nearly the size of England, home to some 23 million people, is a black hole, an ocean of dark. Barbara Demick, a foreign correspondent for The Los Angeles Times, begins her excellent new book, “Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea,” by poring over these satellite images. She’s shocked by them, and moved. “North Korea is not an undeveloped country,” she observes. “It is a country that has fallen out of the developed world.” “Nothing to Envy” is one of three provocative new books about North Korea, from writers who are committed to parsing the slivers of light that escape this enigmatic and often baffling place. The others are “The Hidden People of North Korea,” by Ralph Hassig and Kongdan Oh, and “The Cleanest Race,” by B. R. Myers. North Korea is not an easy country to observe. Few foreign journalists are allowed in, and then only with official minders and strictly limited itineraries.  To get a sense of how ordinary citizens live, writers must rely primarily on the accounts of defectors. If we have trouble seeing North Koreans plainly, they cannot see us at all. Telephone use is severely restricted. (Even the telephone book is a classified document marked “secret.”)  Postal service is spotty.  There is essentially no e-mail. Television and radios receive only approved channels. The country’s citizens are force-fed a steady, numbing diet of state propaganda devoted to sustaining the personality cult of Kim Jong-il and savaging all things American. How are North Koreans taught to think about us? Well, here’s one indication. Children learn a ditty called “Shoot the Yankee Bastards” in music class. One verse goes: Our enemies are the American bastardsWho are trying to take over our beautiful fatherland.With guns that I make with my own handsI will shoot them. BANG, BANG, BANG. (The truly poignant words here are “with my own hands.”) Ms. Demick’s book is a lovely work of narrative nonfiction, one that follows the lives of six ordinary North Koreans, including a female doctor, a pair of star-crossed lovers, a factory worker and an orphan. It’s a book that offers extensive evidence of the author’s deep knowledge of this country while keeping its sights firmly on individual stories and human details. The people Ms. Demick observes lived, before their defections, in northeastern North Korea,  far from the country’s tidy, Potemkin village-like capital, Pyongyang. The existences she describes sound brutal: there is often not enough food; citizens work long days  that can be followed by hours of ideological training at night;  spying on one’s neighbors is a national pastime;  a nonpatriotic comment, especially an anti-Kim Jong-il wisecrack, can have you sent to a gulag for life, if not executed. Ms. Demick writes especially well about the difficult lives of those who do manage to defect. Not only are they bewildered by life outside of North Korea, and have to be taught to do things like use an A.T.M.,  but they also live with deep shame and guilt, knowing that relatives left behind have probably been sent to prison as punishment for their escape. Mr. Hassig and Ms. Oh’s book, “The Hidden People of North Korea: Everyday Life in the Hermit Kingdom,” is wonkier than Ms. Demick’s and less reader-friendly, but it covers more ground. The authors are married (Ms. Oh’s parents were North Koreans who fled to South Korea); he is an independent consultant specializing in North Korean affairs, and she is on the research staff of the Institute for Defense Analysis in Alexandria, Va. Their book is based on more than 200 interviews with defectors, and it paints a picture of a restless populace, increasingly dubious about the official propaganda.  “It would be a gross exaggeration to say that the people support Kim Jong-il,” they write. “Rather, it does not occur to them to oppose him.”  North Koreans are too busy trying to survive, and too preoccupied by the tensions of the supposed mighty conflict with America, to be able to think about much else. Mr. Hassig and Ms. Oh’s portrait of  Mr. Kim’s  hyper-sybaritic lifestyle is detailed and devastating. He may look like a man of the people, they write, with his tan slacks, zippered jackets and stout build that make him resemble Jackie Gleason as Ralph Kramden in “The Honeymooners.” But they chronicle his obsession with the latest electronics,  the “pleasure teams” of girls he keeps handy,  the Bordeaux wine he has flown in. While many of his people starve, they write, Mr. Kim “is such a connoisseur that, according to his former chef, every grain of rice destined for his dinner table is inspected for quality and shape.” The authors are aware that Mr. Kim’s  anti-American paranoia isn’t baseless. The leader of a different country in George W. Bush’s “axis of evil,” they note, was captured and later hanged. Mr. Hassig and Ms. Oh’s book concludes with pointed policy recommendations. They think it is nearly hopeless to negotiate with Mr. Kim  and suspect that “nonproliferation agreements with the regime will simply encourage it to brandish new threats in the future.” Instead of fixating on Korea’s weapons, the authors suggest bypassing the regime and reaching out to North Korea’s people, who sorely need humanitarian aid and “a new way of thinking about their government and their society.” Mr. Myers, the author of “The Cleanest Race: How North Koreans See Themselves — and Why It Matters,” is a contributing editor to The Atlantic  and famously the author of“A Reader’s Manifesto,”a controversial and humorless broadside against the literary writers (Annie Proulx and Cormac McCarthy among them) whom he finds pretentious or obscure. Mr. Myers directs the international studies department at Dongseo University in South Korea. He is a crisp, pushy writer who is at his best when on the attack, and his often counterintuitive new book attempts a psychological profile of Kim Jong-il and his regime. Mr. Myers has pored through mountains of North Korean propaganda — from nightly news reports and newspapers to war movies, comics, wall posters and dictionaries   —  and he argues that the West is misreading the country’s core beliefs. He explains that North Korea’s dominant worldview is “far removed” from the Communism, Confucianism and official “show-window” ideologies that Westerners analyze. Instead, he argues, this worldview “can be summarized in a single sentence: The Korean people are too pure-blooded, and therefore too virtuous, to survive in this evil world without a great parental leader.”  His North Korea is guided by a “paranoid, race-based nationalism.” Mr. Myers’s arguments are too wily and complex to be neatly summarized here, but he includes a fascinating analysis of Mr. Kim’s  depiction as an essentially — and crucially — feminine military leader.  His regime presents North Korea more as a motherland than a fatherland,  Mr. Myers writes, and he cites official slogans about Mr. Kim  like “We Cannot Live Away From His Breast.”  The lack of a patriarchal authority figure, he says, “may also have helped the regime preserve stability by depriving people of a target to rebel against.” Mr. Myers also cautions against the idea that the West can persuade North Korea to shed its nuclear weapons.  Mr. Kim  “cannotdisarm and hope to stay in power,” he writes.  At the same time, he notes, “blue jeans will not bring downthisdictatorship.”  Any signs of serious unrest, he observes, will encourage Mr. Kim  to raise the level of   the tension with the West, and possibly do something rash with his nuclear arsenal. Kim Jong-il reportedly suffered a stroke in 2008 and has looked frail during his recent, and increasingly rare, public appearances. While the world speculates about his successor, almost certainly to be one of his sons,  one of the lessons of these books is not to remove our eyes from the blinkered lives of the average North Korean. “The Kim regime essentially holds its people hostage,” Mr. Hassig and Ms. Oh write, and they are dismayed to note that “the United States is much more interested in the hostage taker’s weapons of mass destruction than in the fate of his hostages.” North Koreans sometimes joke, Ms. Demick writes in “Nothing to Envy,” that they live like “frogs in the well.” It’s a line that sends you back to study those satellite images, and to contemplate those who dwell under Mr. Kim’s inky moral darkness.

Kim Jong-il’s bright smiles were not returned by Bill Clinton. Yet the grinning North Korean and stony-faced American were no doubt savoring their moment of mutual relevance.

WASHINGTON When I look at the incorrigible Kim Jong-il, an insult hurled by the incomparable Billy Wilder comes to mind. Leon Wieseltier, the literary editor of The New Republic, was having dinner with Wilder years ago when the subject of Swifty Lazar, the very famous and very short agent, came up. Putting down his knife and fork, Wilder announced: “That man should go hang himself from a bonsai tree.” The diminutive North Korean leader has been known to use lifts in his shoes. This time, he demanded some special stature in the form of a diplomatic cameo by our top diplomat’s husband. There were no bonsais in view, unfortunately. But the two leaders posed, stiff as tree trunks, in front of a mural of waves. Kim Jong-il’s bright smiles were not returned by Bill Clinton. It was strange to see the reclusive Kim so eager and the raffish Clinton so disciplined. Yet the grinning North Korean and stony-faced American were no doubt both savoring their moment of mutual relevance. The price set by Kim for releasing the two captured American journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, was a few hours basking in the presence of the ex-president who most wanted to visit North Korea. Bill Clinton was willing to bow but not scrape. Hillary sparked an international spat when she said that, as a mother, she understood that the North Koreans were simply unpopular and unruly children misbehaving to get attention. Now, less than two weeks later, those bad-seed children had managed to command the full attention of her husband. Maybe it was some clever North Korean revenge plot, giving the limelight to Daddy to punish Mommy. Just as Hillary muscled her way back into the spotlight, moving past her broken elbow and grabbing the focus from her bevy of peacock envoys, she was blown off the radar screen again by an even more powerful envoy: the one she lives with. It was a moment unique in the annals of diplomacy. Bill was being hailed as a dazzling statesman who might have changed the stormy weather between the U.S. and North Korea, just as Hillary was beginning an 11-day trip to Africa designed to highlight the subjects she most cares about: do-gooder development and women’s issues. The one in charge of world affairs disappeared from the news all day on Tuesday.  The one out of office dominated the news. His plane is rolling down the runway in Pyongyang with the two pardoned women on board? Zowie! Bill had the additional schadenfreude spritz of knowing that he had usurped three men he’d had fraught relationships with  —  Bill Richardson, Jimmy Carter and Al Gore (whose media company the women were working for)  —  by getting the high-profile assignment to rescue the damsels in distress. Richardson, labeled “Judas” by James Carville after he endorsed Barack Obama in the campaign, was reduced to the supporting role of CNN commentator, giving Bill props on protocol: “The fact that he saw Kim Jong-il is huge. He only sees big shots and heads of state.” It’s fun to speculate whether Bill and Kim discussed the exchange of insults with Hillary. (North Korea issued a jibe back that Hillary was “a funny lady” and that “sometimes she looks like a primary schoolgirl and sometimes a pensioner going shopping.”) You can picture a charming Bill putting matters in perspective: “Pay no mind to that, Kimmie. She’s an amazin’ woman, but she just goes off sometimes. You should hear what she calls me when she gets riled up. An unruly teenager and then some.” Conservatives were screeching, naturally, that the Clinton trip would provide propaganda cover to the North Koreans to continue their nuclear shell game. “Despite decades of bipartisan U.S. rhetoric about not negotiating with terrorists for the release of hostages,” John Bolton wrote for The Washington Post’s Web site, “it seems that the Obama administration not only chose to negotiate, but to send a former president to do so.” But the former Bush bullies have no credibility on diplomacy. They spent eight years wrecking it, and the score for them on North Korea is 0-6; zero meetings with Kim and enough plutonium for six nuclear bombs. Bill Clinton will bring back valuable information about Kim’s mental and physical health. If we’d had that sort of information about the snubbed Saddam, we would have known that he was in his own spiral of doom, trying to bluff his neighbors, with no need for our shock and awe. Hillary and President Obama look bigger when they share the stage with other talented players. And Barack and Bill may have finally started to put South Carolina behind them  —  without the need for a beer summit photo-op.

As North Korea announced the detonation of a nuclear device, its primary audience may be its own population.

==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — WhenNorth Koreasuddenly announced Monday that it had conducted a second nuclear test, the initial view across the region was that this had been yet another defiant gambit by the North to extract more concessions from Washington. That has been the oft-repeated pattern in the past, and is likely to be one motivation now as well, say North Korea watchers. But this time around, North Korea’s succession crisis is the primary impetus, many experts believe, suggesting that the audience for the test is its own population as much as the United States. Monday’s test is the culmination  of  a shift toward a more assertive foreign policy, which some analysts say seems to have begun not long after the North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, is believed to have suffered a stroke in August. Speculation about a successor has focused on his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, which would continue the family dynasty to the third generation — one unique among Communist nations. Some experts say the test was a display of might aimed at showing solidarity with North Korea’s powerful military, whose support would be essential in securing Mr. Kim’s choice of successor. Others believe the intended audience was North Korea’s largely impoverished population, in hopes a display of technological prowess could serve as the elder Mr. Kim’s legacy in a government that has failed to deliver even basic food and electricity. Either way, the North Korean government most likely hopes the test will help ensure a smooth transition of power — and, perhaps, show that the elder Kim is still in charge, at least for now. “Kim Jong-il wants to show that he has given his nation mighty nuclear power,” said Yoon Deok-min, a senior researcher at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security, a Seoul-based research organization. “This test was absolutely a domestic demonstration.” Analysts called the test a sign that the ruling family may be preparing for a transition. Last month, Kim Jong-il’s brother-in-law, Jang Seong-taek, joined the National Defense Commission, the most powerful group in the  government, said Kim Sung-han, an international relations professor at Korea University in Seoul. He said Mr. Jang’s promotion might  be a move to secure support from the military in case Mr. Kim’s health worsens. In April, South Korean news mediareportedthat Kim Jong-un, who is in his mid-20s, was appointed to a low-ranking job in the commission. Mr. Jang, Kim Sung-han said, may also be a caretaker until the younger Kim is old enough to assume power in a society that values seniority. “The test is a signal of Kim Jong-il’s desire to build good ties with the military,” he said. “The military is key to the succession.” To be sure, as North Korea experts admit, trying to fathom this highly secretive government’s motives is an exercise in tea leaf reading. And most North Korea watchers agree that the North is still keen to use nuclear brinksmanship to extract as much aid and food as possible out of Washington, in what has become a tried-and-true strategy. It tried  this in 1998, when it fired a multistage rocket over Japan, following up months later with an offer to halt long-range missile tests. Those concessions resulted in a thaw in ties with Washington that led to a groundbreaking visit two years later by then Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. The problem is that these improvements in relations have often proved short-lived. Just a year ago, North Koreablew up the cooling towerat its mainnuclear weaponsplant after agreeing to give up its weapons program. But it reneged on that promise in April, restarting its program out of anger at United Nations sanctions for a long-range rocket test. There are also those who say the North’s main objective in Monday’s test was simply to advance its nuclear technology, in order to build an independent deterrent along the lines of Israel’s  or Pakistan’s. Early seismic readings show the underground blast, in North Korea’s northeast, was much more powerful than its first nuclear test three years ago, news reports in South Korea said. Most experts agree that the North sees development of nuclear bombs and other weapons as the best way to ensure the current government’s survival. They also say it hopes that this will force the United States to accept North Korea as a nuclear-armed state, just as it dropped its objections to India, and eventually normalize relations. “It is like proposing to someone with a pistol,” said Masao Okonogi, a political scientist at Tokyo’s Keio University. “There is a big gap between North Korea’s goal and its means. But this is the only way that North Korea knows how to operate.” Mr. Okonogi believes that the North conducted Monday’s test mainly to grab Washington’s attention. He said there was a perception among North Korean leaders that their nation has been a lower priority for the new administration of President Obama — a view that does reflect an administration strategy of trying to play down North Korea, given the succession crisis and the current focus on Iran. “They want to be recognized as a nuclear-armed nation,” said Mr. Kim of Korea University. He added, with some hyperbole, “If Washington would do that, I’m sure the North would even be willing to send troops to help in Afghanistan.”

SEOUL, South Korea — One day after an American diplomat offered new talks onNorth Korea’s nuclear program, the North said Friday that it had become useless to talk with the United States, adding that “unchanged” American hostility has caused the country to resume and bolster its nuclear efforts. “The study of the policy pursued by the Obama administration for the past 100 days since its emergence made it clear that the U.S. hostile policy toward the D.P.R.K. remains unchanged,” an unnamed spokesman of the North Korean Foreign Ministry said, using the initials for the North’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. In comments carried by the North’s official news agency, KCNA, the spokesman also said: “There is nothing to be gained by sitting down together with a party that continues to view us with hostility.” The rebuff fromNorth Koreacame as Stephen W. Bosworth, the United States special envoy, began a trip to Northeast Asia with a fresh offer of dialogue. The North’s vow to “bolster its nuclear deterrent” came just hours before Mr. Bosworth was due to arrive in Seoul. “The United States reiterates its desire to engage both multilaterally and bilaterally with North Korea,” Mr. Bosworth told reporters after holding talks with senior Chinese officials on Thursday, The Associated Press reported. “We believe very strongly that the solution to the tensions and problems of the area now lies in dialogue and negotiation.” North Korea recently reversed its nuclear disarmament agreements with Washington, kicking out United Nations nuclear monitors and threatening to restart its plutonium-making plant and test a nuclear device. Washington led United Nations efforts to tighten sanctions against the North after its launching of a long-range rocket on April 5. And while the Obama administration said it was willing to talk with North Korea, it has so far offered no new incentives to draw Pyongyang back to the negotiating table.

To the Editor: Re “North Korea Statement Raises Worry of a Missile Test” (news article, Feb. 24): With North Korea’s apparent preparations to test a missile that could hit not only South Korea and Japan but possibly also Hawaii or Alaska, the United States and its allies need quickly to state publicly a new self-defense doctrine. It could be put as follows: “Should any nation known to possess and to have tested nuclear fissile material launch a missile capable of reaching the United States or any of its allies and apparently on a trajectory to do so, the United States and its allies will not hesitate to destroy that missile.” This is not intended as a threat but as a caution to all nations not to direct missiles for any purpose on trajectories that might be seen to be directed toward other nations. Nor is this new: it is what we would have done at any time during the cold war if we had had the ability to do so. W. D.

The North Korean leader Kim Jong-il might have suffered a stroke weeks ago, an intelligence official said Tuesday.

==::==
WASHINGTON —Kim Jong-il,North Korea’s leader, is seriously ill and is likely to have suffered a stroke weeks ago, American officials said Tuesday, raising the prospect of a chaotic power struggle in nuclear-armed North Korea. Intelligence officials in Washington said that the exact status of Mr. Kim’s health was unclear, but that on Tuesday he failed to attend a celebration of the 60th anniversary of the founding of North Korea and that American intelligence agencies believed that he  was now under the care of doctors in Pyongyang, North Korea’s capital. On Wednesday, Song Il-ho, a senior North Korean diplomat, denied news reports suggesting Mr. Kim was ill. “We see such reports as not only worthless, but rather as a conspiracy plot,” the Kyodo news agency quoted Mr. Song as saying. Later, the country’s No. 2 leader, Kim Yong-nam, said there was “no problem” with Kim Jong-il, Kyodo reported. Kim Jong-il’s health is a topic of intense interest among governments and security experts, especially because Western officials are unclear about who would succeed the man known as the “Dear Leader.” North Korea is one of the world’s most isolated and unpredictable states, and a messy transfer of power would focus new attention on the security of its nuclear weapons arsenal. Mr. Kim had  not missed  the 10 past military parades staged for major anniversaries, during which columns of armored vehicles and rocket launchers rumbled through Pyongyang’s main plaza and legions of goose-stepping soldiers saluted him. But on Tuesday, there was only a parade by militia groups in charge of civil defense, and Mr. Kim did not attend. An American intelligence official, who, like others interviewed for this article, spoke on condition of anonymity because assessments about Mr. Kim’s health are classified, said Tuesday  that it did not appear that Mr. Kim’s death was imminent. The official said there were no clear indications  the North was stepping up preparations for a  transfer of authority. The official would not say whether American intelligence agencies expected Mr. Kim to fully recover. The topic of Mr. Kim’s health came up in discussions between the chief American negotiator on North Korean nuclear issues, Christopher R. Hill, and Chinese officials during a recent trip by Mr. Hill to China, said a Bush administration official. But despite the closer contacts between China and North Korea, the official said, Mr. Hill did not come away with a clear sense of Mr. Kim’s condition, or what would happen in the event of his death. Earlier this year, the North had agreed to abandon its nuclear weapons programs in return for economic and political rewards from the United States and its allies, a major diplomatic victory for the Bush administration. But late last month the North Korean government reversed course. Angry that Washington had not removed it from a terrorism list, it said it had stopped disabling its main nuclear complex. It is now unclear whether Mr. Kim ordered the reversal or whether other North Korean officials were making decisions  while he was incapacitated. Since the founding of North Korea in 1948 under Soviet guardianship, it  has had only two leaders: Kim Il-sung and, after his death in 1994, his son, Kim Jong-il.  Unlike his father, Mr. Kim has not publicly groomed any of his three sons to eventually take power, said Nicholas Eberstadt, a North Korea expert at the American Enterprise Institute. There are doubts about the abilities of all three sons, and American officials tend to gravitate toward theories that a military committee might take over the country. Underlying that guesswork are questions about who within the military hierarchy would control the country’s small arsenal of nuclear weapons. “There are a lot of people who will give you a series of assumptions about what happens to nuclear control if there is a leadership change,” one senior administration official with access to intelligence on North Korea said Tuesday. “To put it charitably, they are guessing.” South Korea’s largest newspaper, Chosun Ilbo, reported Tuesday that Mr. Kim collapsed Aug. 22, citing an unidentified South Korean diplomat in Beijing. The North’s state-run media have not reported any public appearance by Mr. Kim since mid-August, and speculation was already swirling that he might be in poor health. According to South Korea’s intelligence service, Mr. Kim has chronic heart disease and diabetes. He is believed to be in his mid-60s. Among scholars who examine every broadcast and speech from North Korea the way Kremlinologists once examined the Soviet Union, there has been particular focus on the talk given on Monday by Kim Yong-nam, considered the second-ranking official in the country. According to officials in Washington who read a translation of the speech, Mr. Kim appeared at times to refer to the country’s leader in the past tense, saying at one point, “Comrade Kim Jong-il’s seasoned leadership served as a decisive function that brought about the morning light of a powerful Socialist state and unfolded an era of new prosperity of military-first Korea.” But Kim Jong-il was also referred to in the present tense, including one tribute that said he “is a truly peerless patriot.” North Korea experts in Seoul cautioned that Mr. Kim had often disappeared from public view for extended periods. “The nuclear talks are in a stalemate,” said Kim Keun-sik, a North Korea expert at Kyungnam University in South Korea. “Tensions with the United States are deepening. Kim knew that the world was watching whether he would show up today. For him, this may be a perfect chance to bring world attention to him.”

SEOUL, South Korea, Aug. 15 (AP) —North Koreadetailed a picture of widespread devastation on Wednesday after heavy rains wiped out more than a tenth of its farmland during peak planting season, according to the official news media. The destruction to the country’s agriculture sector, if confirmed, would amount to a quarter of the damage North Korea asserted it suffered in flooding in 1995. That disaster, coupled with outdated farming methods and the loss of North Korea’s benefactor after the collapse of the Soviet Union, led to a famine that is estimated to have killed as many as two million people. North Korea, an impoverished nation, has said that “hundreds” were killed or missing in this month’s floods and as many as 300,000 people were left homeless. An aid agency working in the country said it had been  told that at least 200 were  killed. The vivid portrait of damage in reports from the North’s state-run news media appeared to be a cry for help from a government that maintains strict secrecy regarding its internal affairs. But North Korea has also previously exaggerated the extent of disasters to obtain aid and cover up its own problems in providing for its people because of its decrepit, centrally controlled economy. The official Korean Central News Agency reported Wednesday that an average of 20.6 inches of rain fell across the country from Aug. 7 through Saturday. The World Food Program estimated that the amount of damage the North Koreans claimed would result in losses of about 450,000 tons of crops — nearly half of the one-million-ton annual shortage the country already faces.

TOKYO, June 20 — The stalled six-nation talks overNorth Korea’s nuclear program are likely to resume next month after international nuclear inspectors visit North Korea next week, the chief United States negotiator said here today. The envoy —  Christopher R. Hill, assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs —  said that the  talks were back on track now that a dispute over $25 million in frozen North Korean assets has been resolved. North Korea had refused to move forward with a February agreement unless the assets, which had been frozen in Banco Delta Asia in Macao following accusations by the United States that they were related to illegal activities, were returned to the regime in Pyongyang. With the money issue resolved, North Korea has invited inspectors from the United Nations nuclear monitoring program, the International Atomic Energy Agency, to the country for talks on how to verify and monitor a shutdown of North Korea’s  plutonium-producing Yongbyon reactor. North Korea expelled the inspectors in late 2002 after the collapse of a 1994 agreement. The six-party talks on dismantling the North’s nuclear weapons program iclude South Korea, Russia, China and Japan as well as North Korea and the United States. “We don’t want to have the six-party talks before we’ve gotten going on shutting down the reactor,” Mr. Hill told reporters today after meeting with Japanese officials here. Asked about the possible timing of the next round of talks, Mr. Hill said: “The Chinese have some ideas about, maybe, we could do something early in July.” Earlier, Mr. Hill said that the inspectors will “take about a week to figure out how to monitor the shutdown — then they need to set up their more permanent teams there, and we need to sequence in some six-party talks.” Under the first phase of an agreement reached in February, North Korea promised to shut down its reactor after its assets were returned, and South Korea promised to ship 50,000 tons of heavy fuel to the energy-starved North after the shutdown is confirmed. Mr. Hill said the next round of talks should focus on how to implement the February agreement’s second phase. That task is expected to be more difficult, because it deals with dismantling all of the North’s nuclear program. South Korea and China welcomed the progress in the agreement’s first phase. Japan, which has adopted the most hawkish stance against the North, has so far refused to participate in the agreement. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said that Japan will join the deal only after the cases of about a dozen Japanese allegedly abducted by North Korea over the years are resolved. “First of all, it is important for North Korea to carry out the initial steps,” Mr. Abe said today. “Of course, North Korea is also not showing a sincere attitude with regard to the abduction problem.”

Officials in the Bush administration were angered as the first deadline for North Korea to shut down and seal its main nuclear fuel facility expired.

WASHINGTON, April 14  —  The first deadline forNorth Koreato shut down and seal its main facility for manufacturing nuclear weapons fuel expired Saturday with no apparent action by the North to fulfill its commitments, while China asked angry officials in the Bush administration to show patience. The inaction leaves President Bush vulnerable to attacks from hawks in his own party, who have argued that it was a mistake to return $25 million in frozen funds to the North Koreans  —  much of it believed to be from illicit sales of counterfeit currency and missiles  —  and who doubt that the North Koreans will stop producing bomb fuel as well as give up all of its existing weapons. The White House was silent about the missed deadline, but the chief American negotiator dealing with the North, Christopher R. Hill, told reporters in Beijing, “We don’t have a lot of momentum right now. That is for sure.” Mr. Hill has traveled over the past week to Japan, South Korea and, most recently, China, where officials urged him to allow a little time for the North Koreans to fulfill the accord. But in Washington, officials said they did not know if the Chinese had any independent indications from the North that compliance was forthcoming, or if the North was simply trying to buy some time. North Korean officials told a visiting American delegation earlier this week that they would begin the process of shutting down their reactor at Yongbyon, where for years they have produced plutonium from spent nuclear fuel, as soon as the $25 million was returned. The process has taken far longer than American officials expected, in part because the legal mechanisms for returning the money turned out to be enormously complicated, leading the Bush administration to give up its demand that all illicit funds had to be used for some kind of humanitarian purpose. But the agreement that Mr. Hill signed with North Korea on Feb. 13  —  in talks that also included China, Russia, Japan and South Korea  —  gave the North 60 days to deactivate and seal its main plant at Yongbyon, invite back international inspectors and provide a preliminary accounting of how much plutonium it has produced. The country had apparently taken none of those steps by Saturday. During a visit to North Korea this week by Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president, officials in Pyongyang said they would fulfill those obligations within 30 days of receiving the money that was held in accounts of Banco Delta Asia, in Macao. Investigators from the United States Treasury and American intelligence agencies pored through records of the frozen accounts, mapped the banking activities of state-owned companies, arms traders and the leaders surrounding President Kim Jong-il. “This was the first thing we ever did that got the North Koreans’ attention,” a senior White House official said in an interview this week, declining to speculate how the administration would react if the North Koreans missed the first deadlines for shutting its facilities. In fact, some administration officials acknowledge that they have few good options. With the money cleared for return, the Macao accounts no longer provide diplomatic leverage. That leaves the administration more dependent than ever on pressure from China, the North’s main supplier of energy and aid, to force North Korea to live up to the agreement. Nicholas Eberstadt, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said that turning the money back to the North “complicates the logic of the Proliferation Security Initiative,” the administration’s plan to stop countries from illicit shipments of weapons, because it is allowing the North to retrieve its profits from those activities. “It also goes contrary to the Security Council resolution” passed at Washington’s urging after North Korea’s nuclear test on Oct. 9, he said. The test was something of a fizzle, a subkiloton explosion, but it was enough to win unanimous passage of a resolution that imposes new economic sanctions on the North. Now, Mr. Eberstadt said, “the North Koreans can force the Bush administration into continuing, humiliating reversals of its policy.” But administration officials dispute that view, arguing that Mr. Bush never reversed his policy. They contend that he simply waited for the right moment to strike the deal, after the nuclear test angered China’s leaders enough to move them from a neutral arbiter in the talks to a source of pressure on the North. North Korea reached the deal, they argue, because both China and South Korea cut aid. In public statements, both Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, have defended the accord as far more effective than an agreement signed between North Korea and President Bill Clinton in 1994, freezing the Yongbyon plant. “What you are hearing,” one senior official said, “are the complaints of a lot of people who simply don’t think we should be dealing with the North Koreans at all.” Among those who have objected, though, are former Bush administration officials who believe that the president has been so eager for a diplomatic coup that he has given up his principles — and is perpetuating Mr. Kim’s rule. Mr. Bush’s former ambassador to the United Nations, John R. Bolton, recently expressed the hope that the North Koreans would violate the Feb. 13 agreement and give Mr. Bush an excuse to renounce the deal. “One sign of whether we are in trouble is whether the administration will call this a  ‘violation’ or use words like “noncompliance,” Mr. Bolton said recently, anticipating that North Korea would miss the Saturday deadline. Assuming that the North allows in international inspectors and seals the Yongbyon plant and the nearby nuclear reprocessing facility where it turns spent nuclear fuel into bomb-grade plutonium, it would then have to move on to the hardest part of the agreement. It is required to “disable” the nuclear facilities, a term that the agreement does not define. Ultimately, it would have to account for, and surrender, all of its nuclear weapons, an arsenal that American intelligence agencies believe has grown from enough fuel for one or two weapons when Mr. Bush took office, to fuel for somewhere between a half-dozen and a dozen weapons.

The funds were frozen when the United States accused a Macao bank of money laundering and distributing counterfeit American currency on behalf of North Korea.

BEIJING, March 22 — Talks here aimed at dismantlingNorth Korea’s nuclear weapons program were halted by China late Thursday after they stalled over the  failure to release from a Macao bank up to $25 million that North Korea had demanded be returned before it continued negotiations. Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state who is leading the American team at the disarmament talks, confirmed that the transfer of the frozen money had been delayed by technical banking issues and said Chinese officials were working to transfer the money from the bank, Banco Delta Asia. No date has been set for the talks to resume, but Mr. Hill said that a Feb. 13 agreement that North Korea would shut down its Yongbyon reactor by April 13 in return for economic aid and that security pledges remained on track. He declined to comment on the specific reasons it was proving difficult to release the money from accounts linked to North Korea. Those accounts have been frozen since September 2005, when the United States accused Banco Delta Asia, a small, family-owned bank, of money laundering and distributing counterfeit American currency on behalf of North Korea. Banco Delta Asia has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Over four days of six-nation talks here this week, North Korean negotiators refused to discuss arms control until the money was transferred to an account North Korea controls in the Bank of China, a state-owned Chinese lender. “To me, it highlights the degree of” North Korea’s “isolation that it sometimes proves difficult to return money to them even when everybody wants to see the money returned to them,” Mr. Hill said. “It really was an issue of how do you move bank accounts.” He said he expected the money to be transferred within days, but there was confusion late Thursday about how North Korea would get it and how much of the $25 million the North was entitled to have. The president of the Bank of China, Li Lihui, said Thursday that the bank had not been asked to handle the transaction. “I can tell you that up until now, we were not asked to deal with this business,” The Associated Press quoted him as telling reporters in Hong Kong. However, China’s chief negotiator at the talks, Wu Dawei, who has been involved in efforts to transfer the money, said that the Bank of China had concerns about accepting it and that “not all the concerns have been assuaged.” Russia chided the United States on Thursday, saying it had undermined the talks. “The American side promised to resolve the financial question, and this promise was not fulfilled,” Aleksandr Losyukov, Russia’s negotiator said, after returning to Moscow, Reuters reported, quoting the Interfax news agency. Accounts controlled by about 50 North Korean banks, trading companies and people were frozen in Banco Delta Asia with $7 million in the account of Daedong Credit Bank, the North’s only foreign-managed bank. After an 18-month investigation, the United States Treasury Department on March 14 banned American banks from dealing with Banco Delta Asia, effectively isolating it from the American financial system. The Treasury Department’s action has angered North Korea and become a major sticking point in nuclear disarmament efforts. In a statement on its Web site, the Macao monetary authority said it would handle all money in Banco Delta Asia according to instructions from the account holders. However, banking analysts said it was unlikely that all account holders would agree to have their money transferred to an account they could not control in the Bank of China. They also questioned whether the Chinese bank would be comfortable accepting money without question from a bank that the United States had accused of crimes. Daedong has said it can prove that the sources of the money frozen in its account are legitimate and has been lobbying officials in Macao and Washington to have the money released. Colin McAskill, a British businessman who is buying the bank, was unavailable for comment. Soon after the United States moved against the bank in September 2005, North Korea boycotted the six-nation talks with protests reported by its state-controlled news media. It consented to return to the talks only when the United States agreed late last year to hold separate negotiations on Banco Delta Asia. The United States announced Monday that the frozen money would be returned to the North via the Bank of China after North Korea pledged that the money would be used for humanitarian purposes and education.

North Korea pledged to honor its commitment to dismantle its nuclear arms program only after sanctions had been lifted on its funds frozen in a bank in Macao since 2005.

BEIJING, March 14 — The chief of theInternational Atomic Energy Agencysaid here on Wednesday thatNorth Koreahad pledged to honor its commitment to dismantle its nuclear arms program only after sanctions had been lifted on its funds frozen in a bank in Macao since 2005, which could introduce a snag in carrying out the accord negotiated with the United States last month. In Washington on Wednesday, the Treasury Department concluded a year-and-a-half investigation into the bank, Banco Delta Asia, with the expected announcement of a ban on American banks doing business with it. The end of the investigation is expected to lead to the return of part of $25 million in frozen North Korea funds, but the amount and timing remain unclear. American officials have said that the authorities in Macao, a semiautonomous region of China, would decide those issues, but that only funds related to legitimate activities would be returned, not those connected with illicit activities like money laundering, counterfeiting, and narcotics and weapons trafficking. They have expressed confidence that a partial release of funds would satisfy North Korea. On the other hand, some American officials say that the nuclear disarmament accord with North Korea is delicate. They say that North Korea’s behavior is often unpredictable, and that in the past the North has agreed to something in principle  but then has seized on relatively small points in  how  it has been carried out as a pretext for backing out of the agreement. Mohamed ElBaradei, the chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency, spoke after a visit to Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. It was the first such visit by an official of the United Nations nuclear agency since 2002, when North Korea expelled nuclear inspectors stationed there under a previous disarmament accord. The United States and North Korea accused each other of violating the accord that year, and North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty shortly thereafter. Dr. ElBaradei said North Korean officials had pledged to adhere to the terms of the Feb. 13 accord, which requires that it close its main facility to produce plutonium in exchange for shipments of heavy fuel oil, and allows nuclear inspectors back into the country. But he said the officials emphasized that they would not act until the United States resolved the dispute over the deposits. The North Korean officials “mentioned that they are waiting for the lifting of sanctions with regard to the Macao bank,” Dr. ElBaradei said. Referring to the closing of the nuclear complex at Yongbyon, he said, “They said they are ready, willing and capable of doing that as soon as the financial sanctions are lifted.” The scope and timing of nuclear inspections remain to be worked out in future talks, but Dr. ElBaradei said his trip had been intended to restore ties between his agency and North Korean officials, and he called his meetings “quite useful.” His visit ended as Christopher R. Hill, an assistant secretary of state and the lead United States negotiator at the six-nation talks involving the North Korean nuclear program, arrived in Beijing for a new round of negotiations on how to carry out the Feb. 13 accord. Detailed discussions on various aspects of the accord were expected to continue into next week, and are viewed as essential if North Korea is  to  follow through on its promise to shut down Yongbyon by mid-April.

Saying North Korea had agreed to adhere to nuclear concessions, the U.S. took it off a list of terrorism sponsors.

WASHINGTON — The Bush administration announced Saturday that it had removedNorth Koreafrom a list of state sponsors of terrorism in a bid to salvage a fragile nuclear deal that seemed on the verge of collapse. Sean McCormack, the State Department spokesman, said that the United States made the decision after North Korea agreed to resume disabling a plutonium plant and to allow some inspections to verify that it had halted its nuclear program as promised months earlier. The deal, which the Bush administration had portrayed as a major foreign policy achievement, began slipping away in recent weeks in a dispute over the verification program. Just days ago, North Korea barred international inspectors from the plant. The decision to remove North Korea from the terror list was a dramatic moment for President Bush, who had called the country part of an “axis of evil” and had only reluctantly ordered administration officials to engage in negotiations, saying that the United States had made deals with the nation’s leaders before without winning enough concessions. That calculus changed in 2006, when North Korea exploded a nuclear device. But Mr. Bush is already having trouble selling the new agreement to his own party. Republican lawmakers, including the presidential nominee, Senator John McCain, quickly expressed concern, complaining that North Korea had yet to demonstrate that it was serious about adhering to its commitment to denuclearize. Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee for president, called the deal “a modest step forward” in dismantlingNorth Korea’s nuclear weaponsprogram. Other Democrats said they welcomed the agreement but noted that it did not go much beyond an agreement President Clinton reached with North Korea in 1994, which the Bush administration, including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, criticized as inadequate. Bush administration officials, trying to head off potential criticism that they were simply seeking a foreign policy victory in their last months, said the agreement was the best the United States could get at this time. Ms. Rice “very strongly feels that it is our own responsibility, until Jan. 20, 2009, to act as good stewards of the national interest,” Mr. McCormack said during a news conference. In the most significant part of the accord announced Saturday, North Korea agreed to a verification plan that would allow United States inspectors access to its main declared nuclear compound, at Yongbyon; international inspectors have worked at the site on and off for years. But the deal puts off decisions on the thorniest verification issue: what would happen if international experts suspected the North was hiding other nuclear weapons facilities, particularly those related to uranium enrichment. The United States wanted the North to agree to inspections at sites that raised suspicions, but North Korea balked. The new agreement calls for United States inspectors to be granted access to such sites “based on mutual consent” with North Korea. Experts on North Korea say that the concession by the United States was probably necessary to achieve a deal, but that it no doubt will lead to future fights, since the North’s leaders will not want to give inspectors free rein to travel the country. Patricia A. McNerney, one of the State Department negotiators, acknowledged that issue would probably lead to a hornets’ nest of problems. “Going into verification with North Korea will not be easy, we know that,” she said. “This is the most secret and opaque regime in the world.” North Korea, which has long sought international acceptance, had been pushing hard to get off the terror list. But Mr. McCormack made clear on Saturday that North Korea is still subject to numerous economic sanctions. The agreement follows weeks of intense negotiations and high-stakes brinkmanship, as North Korea, furious that the Bush administration had not removed it from the terrorism list as it agreed last summer, threatened to restart its plutonium-based weapons program and barred international inspectors from the Yongbyon plant. In Washington, State Department proponents of the deal, including Ms. Rice and her top North Korea envoy, Christopher R. Hill, battled critics inside and outside the administration who castigated them for trying to salvage the accord. The administration has been at war with itself over whether to go ahead with the North Korea pact despite objections from critics in the office of Vice President Dick Cheney, and even some members of the State Department’s verification and compliance office. That rift spilled into the open at the news conference on Saturday, when a reporter asked Paula A. DeSutter, the assistant secretary of state for verification, compliance and implementation, how she responded to criticism of the deal from John R. Bolton, her former boss at the State Department. Ms. DeSutter did not defend the accord, saying simply, “John is the epitome of a skeptical policymaker, and that’s appropriate.” Despite the internal fights, Ms. Rice convinced President Bush last week that this was the best the administration could get in its remaining time in office. But as late as Friday, things remained up in the air, said one administration official, who, like several other officials and diplomats interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the issue. Another senior administration official described the internal deliberations as a “close call.” Senator McCain said in a statement that he would not support the deal until he got some questions answered. “I expect the administration to explain exactly how this new verification agreement advances American interests and those of our allies,” he said. He added that he was “concerned that this latest agreement appears to have been reached between Washington and Pyongyang, and only then discussed with our Asian allies in an effort to garner their support.” Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Republican of Florida, issued a statement strongly criticizing the deal. “I am profoundly disappointed,” she said. “By rewarding North Korea before the regime has carried out its commitments, we are encouraging this regime to continue its illicit nuclear program and violate its pledge to no longer provide nuclear assistance to extremist regimes.” Two of the Bush administration’s main criticisms of the 1994 accord were that it did not mandate the removal of nuclear material from North Korea and that international inspectors were limited to  Yongbyon. The 1994 accord collapsed in 2002 after the Bush administration accused North Korea of circumventing the agreement by pursuing a second path to a bomb, based on enriching uranium. The White House said at the time that it would require full verification that any uranium program had been halted, though later the intelligence community expressed some doubts about how far the program had gotten. Although the new agreement leaves open the possibility of future inspections outside Yongbyon, it leaves vague what mechanism would be used to determine the status of a uranium program. The North has agreed in principle to give up its nuclear material and any weapons, but that seems almost certain to be subject to negotiations with the next president. During the Bush administration, North Korea is believed to have produced enough bomb-grade plutonium for six or more nuclear weapons. Bush administration officials have been consulting about the latest deal with its partners in the so-called “six-party” talks, the group including Russia, South Korea and Japan that negotiated the agreement in 2007 for the North to halt its nuclear activities. Diplomats said that Japan had expressed reservations about removing North Korea from the terror list because the North still had not addressed all of their concerns about abductions of Japanese citizens decades ago. After the official announcement on Saturday, Japan’s finance minister, Shoichi Nakagawa, called the American decision “extremely regrettable.” South Korea has been more supportive. “We welcome the agreement because we believe this will help put the six-party negotiations back on track and eventually lead to the dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear programs,” said Kim Sook, South Korea’s main nuclear envoy, during a news conference in Seoul on Sunday. The South Korean foreign minister, Yu Myung-hwan, had stressed Friday that if the six-party negotiations fell apart now, the next administration would have difficulty restarting them. Gary Samore, a nonproliferation expert in the Clinton administration, characterized the deal as probably the best that could be gotten at this time, but warned of stormy times to come. “Every agreement you ever have with the North Koreans always contains certain ambiguities, and that ends up being the basis for which you have the next round of talks,” he said. “It’s always two steps forward and one step back.” For instance, he said, besides the issue of access to suspected nuclear sites, the United States and North Korea appear to have fudged the critical issue of whether American inspectors will be allowed to take all the samples they want out of the country to foreign laboratories for inspection. According to a fact sheet issued by the Bush administration, the two sides agreed “on the use of scientific procedures, including sampling and forensic activities,” although the sheet doesn’t say where those tests would be done. Mr. Bolton, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations under Mr. Bush, said that the Bush administration had “punted” the hardest issue, that of inspections beyond declared nuclear sites. “This means that North Korea has a veto over everything beyond Yongbyon,” he said, “so that’s a clear victory for North Korea.”

Shifting dynamics between civilian officials and military leaders may have led to steps toward denuclearization.
==::==

TOKYO — International television crews were invited to reclusiveNorth Koreaon Friday to witness the destruction of the cooling tower at the country’s main nuclear weapons plant. Viewers around the world later watched the most visible symbol of the North’s nuclear ambitions collapse in a cloud of shattered concrete. In North Korea itself, however, the explosion was a nonevent. The state news agency  carried no information about it on Friday, and the images had not found their way onto state television. News blackouts are not big news in isolated North Korea, which also let a full day pass before it let its people know, on state television and radio, that President Bush had removed it from the United States’ list of countries that sponsor terrorism. It couched that development in a  warning that Washington had not yet fully abandoned its “hostile policy” toward the North. Mr. Bush characterized the latest steps toward denuclearization as a “moment of opportunity for North Korea.” But the North’s cagey reaction suggests that any lasting change inKim Jong-il’s secretive, xenophobic approach to governing one of the world’s most cloistered nations is likely to be painfully slow, at best. Though there are hints that North Korea’s powerful military may have relaxed what analysts have described as its wariness about bargaining in earnest on nuclear weapons, experts warn that it is far from clear that Mr. Kim intends to give up all of the country’s existing atomic bombs or the capacity to produce new ones. Still, North Korea watchers in neighboring South Korea and China say that this week’s deal appeared to have emerged from the shifting dynamics between North Korea’s reform-oriented civilian officials and hard-line military leaders. If the civilian leadership keeps the upper hand, that could foreshadow a more robust pace of change in the country’s deeply impoverished economy, they say. “I don’t think it was one group winning against the other, but I think this agreement came out of long discussions between civilian and military leaders,” said Song Min-soon, who served as South Korea’s chief nuclear negotiator and then as foreign minister from late 2006 to early this year. “Groups inside North Korea who want to reform will now gain a voice.” In his past negotiations, Mr. Song said, his North Korean counterparts referred often to objections from “other institutions in Pyongyang,” the capital, which the South Koreans interpreted as the military and officials from the ruling party. “For some time, I thought it was just an excuse not to make a deal, but later I came to believe that it was not just an excuse but the reality there,” said Mr. Song, who is now a member of the National Assembly. Even if they disagreed about the nuclear program and relations with the outside world, however, reformers and hard-liners are driven by a shared goal of survival, experts said. Paik Hak-soon, a North Korea expert at the Sejong Institute in Seoul, South Korea, said that since the collapse of the Soviet Union, North Korea had basically pursued the long-term goal of formally ending the Korean War and normalizing relations with the United States. “That is the only way for North Korea to survive,” Mr. Paik said. “North Korea wanted the United States to come to the negotiating table, and since the United States did not want to come voluntarily, North Korea used the nuclear card.” It is a card that the North is unlikely to give up easily. In Thursday’s declaration, the North disclosed its plutonium-related activities at the Yongbyon reactor, its main nuclear plant. But the much more difficult task of persuading the North to give up its existing nuclear weapons, estimated at roughly half a dozen, comes in the next stage of talks. North Korea’s declaration did not specify how many nuclear bombs it had. Officials there have not formally addressed Washington’s contention that, in addition to its well-known efforts to make nuclear fuel from plutonium, the country has a parallel, underground program to make bomb fuel from enriched uranium. Xu Guangyu, a Chinese analyst often sympathetic to North Korea, said negotiations were unlikely to advance much, given  Mr. Bush’s short time  in office. “North Korea is not going to give up their nuclear weapons easily,” he said. “That is the last card they have to play with America. They want to keep their card to see what the next president will do with North Korea.” Friday’s destruction of the tower, the most conspicuous element of the nuclear complex at Yongbyon, 60 miles north of Pyongyang, did reaffirm the incremental progress that had been made in Chinese-brokered multilateral negotiations to end North Korea’s weapons programs. While the North  has  kept its nuclear activities shrouded in secrecy, steam curling from the tower into the atmosphere was captured in spy satellite photographs, providing outside observers with the most visible sign of operations at Yongbyon. “As you all saw, the cooling tower is no longer there,” Sung Kim, a senior State Department official who witnessed the blast from a hill, told South Korean television. “It’s a very significant disablement step.” But some experts in South Korea said the demolition did not answer critical questions, such as how many weapons North Korea has built or whether it has exported its nuclear technology to countries like Syria. “It’s symbolic. But in real terms, whether demolishing or not a cooling tower that has already been disabled doesn’t make much difference,” said Lee Ji-sue, a North Korea expert at Seoul’s Myongji University. The demolition also shows that North Korea has concluded that the Yongbyon complex, in service for several decades, has served its purpose after producing an unknown number of nuclear weapons, Mr. Lee said. Whether North Korea’s removal from the terrorism list and the lifting of other sanctions announced by Mr. Bush on Thursday lead to much economic progress could depend, again, on how the tensions between reformers and conservatives play out. In the past, China has encouraged Mr. Kim to emulate its own success by reforming and opening its failing state-run economy. In recent years, North Korea has experimented with some isolated market reforms and allowed the opening of a South Korean-run industrial complex in Kaesong, just north of the demilitarized zone. But Jin Linbo, a senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, said Mr. Kim had shown no real interest in a systemic economic overhaul.  “These experiments can only be regarded as ways that North Korea is trying in order to find a way to make money,” he said. As for large-scale economic reforms, “No, that is too dangerous for the regime,” he said. But Moon Chung-in, a political scientist at Yonsei University in Seoul who was South Korea’s ambassador for international security affairs until earlier this year, said he believed that economic change would accelerate now that progress had been made on the nuclear accord. “Whenever I’ve met party officials in the past, they’ve told me: ‘We don’t want the United States or South Korea to dictate how to manage our economy. You cannot make us open up and reform. But we really are desperate and want to modernize the motherland,’ ” Mr. Moon said. “You have to be careful about not using the word ‘reform’; they are sensitive about that and prefer ‘modernize,’ ” he said. Thursday’s deal could also provide a boost to North Korea’s special industrial zone, which, despite restrictions, has been growing steadily since opening in late 2004. Today, 72 companies employing 294,702 North Koreans operate there. They include three foreign companies: two Chinese manufacturers and a German auto-parts maker. “European companies were careful about going to Kaesong because they didn’t want to be linked with North Korea,” said Jean-Jacques Grauhar, secretary general of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in Seoul, which toured Kaesong last month. “But now companies will be more serious about looking at business opportunities in North Korea.”

North Korea’s federation appealed the ban on its team because one member, Hong Su Jong, falsified her age. The team and Hong were barred for 30 days last week because she entered the world championships, which begin Saturday in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, using the third birth date of her career. Hong listed her birth year as 1989, although International Gymnastics Federation documents show that she competed at the 2004 Athens Olympics and the 2006 world championships using a birth year of 1985. She won the silver medal on vault at the 2007 worlds listing 1986 as her birth year. If Hong was born in 1989, she would have been ineligible to compete in Athens. Gymnasts must turn at least 16 in the calendar year of an Olympics to be eligible.

Who knew “Mad Men” had hit Pyongyang? North Korea makes an attempt to create brand awareness.

WASHINGTON WHO knew “Mad Men” had hit Pyongyang? Or so it seemed last week, when the North Korean governmentreleased photographs of a rare meeting of the Korean Workers’ Party, and delegates were seen walking purposefully through Pyongyang Station on their way to formally designate the next ruler of the Kim dynasty. That would beKim Jong-un, son of the ailing Dear Leader,Kim Jong-il, and grandson of the Great Leader, Kim Il-sung. The delegates wore suits of nearly identical, somewhat boxy cut, and carried 1960s-style briefcases that the admen of the AMC television series might have swung on Madison Avenue. It was a flashback for anyone lucky enough to have ever strolled the empty streets of Pyongyang, a capital in a time machine, with its Stalin-era ceremonial buildings and limousines that could have fit the Kennedy era. Like the Mad Men, the attendees at the Korean Workers’ Party session were trying to create brand awareness — and they don’t have much time to do so. Pyongyang had decades to build up mythologies about how Grandpa Kim singlehandedly ousted the Japanese, and how Papa Kim offered benevolent “guidance” in building each factory. But the last transition unfolded over 20 years. With Kim Jong-il clearly sick, this transition has to be fast, which is why Kim Jong-un went from civilian to four-star general in an announcement on the state radio. It is also why the photographs last week were read so carefully here in Washington. There were hints of whatNorth Korea’s leaders wish the world to see, and what they hope nobody will notice. “These are pictures about one united party, one enduring bloodline,” said Nicholas Eberstadt of theAmerican Enterprise Institute, “and an obstinate refusal to change direction.”

The sanctions, announced by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, aim to cut off sources of hard currency.

SEOUL, South Korea — The Obama administration announced Wednesday that it would impose further economic sanctions againstNorth Korea, throwing legal weight behind a choreographed show of pressure on the North that included an unusual joint visit to the demilitarized zone by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates. The measures, announced here by Mrs. Clinton after talks with South Korean officials, focus on counterfeiting, money laundering and other dealings that she said the North Korean government used to generate hard currency to pay off cronies and cling to power. While the United States already places heavy sanctions on North Korea, American officials insisted that the new measures would further tighten the financial vise around the secretive and isolated North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, who, according to regional intelligence,is in declining health. The unilateral American action came two months after a South Korean-led investigationfound North Korea responsiblefor the March sinking of theCheonan, a South Korean warship, which killed 46 sailors. The North’s bellicose behavior, analysts say, reflects a deepening power struggle inside the country. But the United States has struggled to build consensus about how harshly to confront the Kim government. While the United Nations Security Council voted tocondemn the sinking of the warship, it did not name North Korea as the culprit because of resistance from China, the North’s neighbor and most important ally. Mrs. Clinton demanded that the North take responsibility for the attack, saying it would continue to be a pariah until it did so. She ruled out any negotiations with the North Korean government until it agreed to relinquish itsnuclear weapons. And she said that the United States would expand and stiffen its sanctions to “target their leadership, target their assets.” “These measures are not directed at the people of North Korea, who have suffered for too long due to the misguided and maligned priorities of their government,” Mrs. Clinton said at a news conference, flanked by Mr. Gates and South Korea’s defense and foreign ministers. “They are directed at the destabilizing, illicit and provocative policies pursued by that government.” Her announcement punctuated a visit rich in symbols of American diplomacy and military might, organized to mark the 60th anniversary of the start of the Korean War. On Tuesday, the United States and South Korea confirmed that they would stagelarge-scale military exercisesin the seas off Japan and the Korean Peninsula, as a show of deterrence against the North. Then, on Wednesday, Mr. Gates and Mrs. Clinton traveled to Panmunjom, in the demilitarized zone, where they clambered up an observation post in a gloomy drizzle to peer into the North. Later, as the pair toured a small building that straddles the military demarcation line between North and South, a North Korean soldier stared at them through a window. Neither acknowledged the soldier. Afterward, the two stood before a phalanx of cameras, under the gaze of guards from the North Korean side, to proclaim solidarity with South Korea. “It is stunning how little has changed up there and yet how much South Korea continues to grow and prosper,” Mr. Gates said, noting that this was his third visit to the demilitarized zone — the first being in the early 1990s when he was director of central intelligence. It was Mrs. Clinton’s first visit. “Although it may be a thin line,”she said, referring to the narrow strip of land separating the two sides, “these two places are worlds apart.” Mrs. Clinton is heading to a regional security meeting in Vietnam on Thursday, where she is likely to face more reluctance to point fingers at North Korea over the Cheonan. On Tuesday, the meeting’s sponsor, theAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations, issued an opening statement that said it “deplored” the sinking but did not name the aggressor. The administration’s show of solidarity with South Korea has complicated ties with China. In addition to its balkiness at the United Nations,Beijing has objected to the joint naval exercises, which have frayed an already tense relationship between the militaries of China and the United States and also prompted a rebuke from North Korea on Thursday. Earlier this year, Beijing brusquelycanceled a planned visitby Mr. Gates. “I remain open to rebuilding and strengthening military-to-military dialogue between the United States and China,” Mr. Gates said. But he added, “We are obviously concerned by some of the things China has said, some of the things China is doing in the military arena; they are worrying.” Administration officials would not give specifics on the planned North Korean sanctions, but said they would mainly build on those already put in place by the Treasury Department or enshrined in the latest Security Council resolution against North Korea. Mrs. Clinton said the United States would designate North Korean companies and individuals involved in weapons proliferation and other illicit activity. As an example, American officials cited trade in counterfeit cigarettes. The sanctions would also focus on liquor, exotic foods and other luxury goods, which the government in Pyongyang uses in a vast system of patronage. And they will take aim at North Korean officials who use diplomatic privilege to cloak their dealings. Mrs. Clinton said she would send her adviser on nonproliferation and arms control, Robert J. Einhorn, in coming days to discuss the sanctions with countries in Asia. Because no legitimate American banks do business with the North, the effectiveness of the measures will depend heavily on persuading banks in other countries to shun North Korea. Given the North’s profound isolation, some analysts question how much more damage sanctions can do. The strategy of aiming sanctions at the country’s elite is similar to the latest United Nations sanctions against Iran. A previous effort to punish politically connected North Koreans, by freezing assets in a Macao-based bank, Banco Delta Asia, where many of them had accounts, was quite successful, analysts said. But the Bush administration later agreed to have the Macao governmentunblock those accountsin an effort to lure North Korea back to negotiations over its nuclear program — a quid pro quo that ultimately led nowhere. The Obama administration insists that it will not cut such deals with the North to restart talks. “They made commitments over the last years to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, which they have reneged on,” Mrs. Clinton said. “They just refuse to actually do it.”

A September meeting of North Korea&#8217;s ruling party is expected to help a son of the ailing North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, consolidate his power as heir.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreasaid Saturday that its ruling Workers’ Party would hold a rare meeting of delegates in September to elect a new party leadership, a move analysts in Seoul said was intended to help a son of the ailing North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, consolidate his power as heir. The gathering will be the most important meeting of the party since it held a convention in 1980 to elect Mr. Kim to its Politburo, an event that signaled his rise to power under his father, Kim Il-sung. Saturday’s announcement, carried by the North’s state-run Korean Central News Agency, said only that the party was convening its representatives “in early September to elect its highest leading body.” South Korean intelligence authorities say they have noticed an increased effort by Mr. Kim, who reportedly suffered a stroke in 2008, to hand over power toKim Jong-un, the youngest of his three known sons. North Korea has been publicizing songs and poems implicitly praising the son, South Korea’s spy chief, Won Sei-hoon, told lawmakers on Thursday. The younger Mr. Kim is also accompanying his father on his “on-site guidance” tours of factories and military units, the South Korean news media quoted Mr. Won as telling the lawmakers in the briefing. North Korea’s economic hardships are deepening, as are its conflicts with the outside world. The North’s propaganda artists have produced 10 million copies of the younger Mr. Kim’s portrait and are waiting for an order to distribute them, said Open Radio for North Korea, a Seoul-based Web site that gathers news from sources inside the North. Every household in North Korea keeps portraits of Mr. Kim and his father, who died in 1994, hanging side by side on a wall. Although South Korean officials have identified Kim Jong-un as the likely successor since last year, most North Koreans and people outside the country know little about him. Only a few photographs that are thought to be of him are available outside North Korea, all reportedly taken when he was a teenager. He is now believed to be either 27 or 28. The impending shuffle in the party leadership follows personnel changes in the military and the powerful National Defense Commission in the past year. The North’s rubber-stamp Parliament met this month to replace several cabinet members and appointed Mr. Kim’s brother-in-law, Jang Song-taek, to the No. 2 post at the defense commission. Mr. Jang is seen as a potential caretaker for Mr. Kim’s son. The officials at the September meeting are likely to bestow key party titles on the son or install people loyal to him in important jobs to help him control the party from behind the scenes, analysts said. “We can expect a big shift” in North Korea, “with Kim Jong-un’s influence gradually eclipsing that of his father among the power elite,” said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior analyst at the Sejong Institute, a South Korean research organization.

All the Democratic Party’s reigning families were brought together around the drama of the North Korea trip.

WASHINGTON — It was a gripping moment:Bill Clinton, the former president, andAl Gore, his vice president, sharing a lengthy embrace as Mr. Clinton delivered two journalists who worked for Mr. Gore back to American soil from captivity in North Korea. Thetableau at the airportin Burbank, Calif., on Wednesday morning was a visible reminder of how circumstances had conspired over the past few days to bring the reigning — and sometimes warring — names of the Democratic Party together around the drama of Mr. Clinton’s trip to North Korea. There on the tarmac were the two dominant Democrats of the 1990s, Mr. Gore and Mr. Clinton, who had played a critical role negotiating the end of an international crisis on behalf of President Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton, the secretary of state and Mr. Obama’s rival for the nomination in 2008. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore did not linger together in public on Wednesday. They have had relatively little contact after their unhappy parting nearly nine years ago, according to associates of the two men. Still, over eight years, they have both built post-White House identities and reputations that seem to have left them at peace with their shared pasts and, it would seem, with each other. “A special thanks to President Clinton,” Mr. Gore said, as Mr. Clinton gazed at him, his head nodding. “My partner and friend. So grateful.” Mike Feldman, a Democratic consultant who has worked for both men, said: “Look, they’ve both gone off and done different things. But when you work side by side as they did, that’s a pretty strong bond and that doesn’t go away. People say they don’t spend a lot of time together — well, they live in different cities.” For just a moment — even with  extra heft and grayer hair — it was easy to recall the happier and era-defining time when Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore captured the attention of the nation,campaigning in a bus caravanin 1992 as the Democratic candidates for president and vice president. On the campaign trail, and later in the White House, the two men and their spouses presented themselves as friends: Sharing a bus and jokes and warm embraces, Mr. Gore introducing Mr. Clinton at every stop on the way, feeding off each other’s riffs and energies. Still, associates of both men said, that relationship was always more pragmatic than personal, a recognition by two very ambitious men, whose similar backgrounds almost ensured a rivalry, that they had stumbled across a chemistry that could deliver them the White House. The tensions that seem to invariably sour relationships between presidents and vice presidents by the end emerged in the Clinton White House, building to the moment when Mr. Gore made clear to associates his revulsion after learning that Mr. Clinton had had an affair with an intern. Mr. Gore confronted Mr. Clinton in the Oval Office after Mr. Gore ran for president in 2000 and lost the electoral vote to George W. Bush ona ruling by the Supreme Court. In the course of a brutal one-hour exchange, aides to both men said, Mr. Gore blamed Mr. Clinton for his loss — suggesting that he had been dragged down by the burden of Mr. Clinton’s impeachment proceedings — and Mr. Clinton angrily attacked Mr. Gore for distancing himself from Mr. Clinton and his record. Mr. Gore avoided appearing with Mr. Clinton in the first years after his defeat, and was viewed in Clinton circles as implicitly supporting Mr. Obama in his competition last year with Mrs. Clinton — though one associate of Mr. Clinton said the former president was appreciative in the end that Mr. Gore had sat it out. But much of that had passed by the time Mr. Gore called Mr. Clinton 10 days ago and asked for his help. And while they have crossed paths from time to time, there has clearly been nothing like the moment on Wednesday when Mr. Gore — spotting Mr. Clinton at the top of the steps coming off the aircraft — walked forward, clapping his hands loudly, leading the audience in applause. They shook hands first, and than hugged for a full five seconds, Mr. Clinton patting his hand along Mr. Gore’s back, lingering, before Mr. Clinton went on to greet the waiting family members.

The move by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on Friday suggests the Obama administration is admitting the women’s culpability in a bid to secure their freedom.

WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Friday that the United States was now seeking “amnesty” for two American journalists imprisoned inNorth Korea, a remark that suggests that the Obama administration was admitting the women’s culpability in a bid to secure their freedom. “The two journalists and their families have expressed great remorse for this incident, and I think everyone is very sorry that it happened,” Mrs. Clinton said Friday morning during a wide-ranging question-and-answer session with State Department employees. “What we hope for now is that these two young women would be granted amnesty through the North Korean system and be allowed to return home to their families as soon as possible.” The two journalists,Laura Ling, 36, andEuna Lee, 32, both reporters for San Francisco-based Current TV, were sentenced in June to 12 years of hard labor after a trial in which they were accused of entering the country illegally and committing “hostile acts.” Ms. Ling reportedly called her sister, Lisa Ling, also a journalist, this week and said in the course of a 20-minute conversation that they had broken North Korean law, but her sister did not say how. Human rights advocates in South Korea have said they were on a reporting assignment about the plight of North Korean women sold through human traffickers and refugees fleeing hunger in North Korea when they were detained March 17. Mrs. Clinton at first said the charges against the women were “baseless,” while the administration pressed for them to be freed on humanitarian grounds. Her comments on Friday appear to reflect a changing picture that has been complicated by the North’s test of a nuclear missile in May and its decision to fire seven ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan on the Fourth of July. A scholar who visited the North said in an interview published Friday in a South Korean daily that the two women were not in a prison camp, but rather in a guest house in Pyongyang, a development that seemed to suggest that the North still wanted talks with Washington on the women’s release. The scholar, Han Park, a political scientist at the University of Georgia, was quoted by the JoongAng Ilbo as saying the North Korean authorities told him the two women were “staying well in a guest house in Pyongyang.” Mrs. Clinton’s comments during a town-hall-style meeting at the State Department came in response to an employee who did not identify herself, creating the appearance that the question was planted in an attempt to send a message to North Korea. A department spokesman, P. J. Crowley, avoided questions about whether the administration had been in direct talks with North Korea. Experts said that Mrs. Clinton appeared to be trying to keep the issue of the journalists separate from the conflict over the North’s nuclear ambitions. “It’s clear to me they don’t want this tail to wag the nuclear dog,” said Michael Green, a top Asia expert for former President George W. Bush. “They are trying to keep it in a separate lane.” But Mr. Green said the North was unlikely to release the women without getting something in return. Although North Korea does not expect the Obama administration to abandon its effort to impose sanctions on the North for its recent nuclear test, he said, it is likely to want a “high-profile visit” by an administration official to demonstrate that “it’s possible to return to business as usual.” At a later appearance on Friday morning, Mrs. Clinton was asked if the State Department intended to send Professor Han as an emissary. “We have nothing to respond to about that,” she said.

Pressing forward on its nuclear weapons, the North vowed to take “military actions” against efforts to isolate it.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Korearesponded Saturday to new United Nations sanctions on Friday by defiantly vowing to press forward with the production ofnuclear weaponsand take “resolute military actions” against international efforts to isolate it. In a statement on the North’s official Korean Central News Agency, an unidentified spokesman for the North Korean Foreign Ministry was quoted as saying that his nation would continue its nuclear program to defend itself against what he called a hostile United States policy. He was quoted as saying that his nation would “weaponize” its existing plutonium stockpiles and begin a program to enrich uranium, which can also be used to make atomic warheads. The statement, which was light on the vitriol that often colors such missives, was released hours after the United Nations Security Council voted to punish the North for its May 25nuclear testand its missile tests.  The Council tightened sanctions, including an arms embargo and a provision that encourages high-seas searches of North Korean ships. “We’ll take firm military action if the United States and its allies try to isolate us,” the spokesman said, according to the KCNA, the news service. The spokesman said that his nation had “reprocessed more than one-third of our spent nuclear fuel rods.” Since the 1990s, United Nations inspectors have tried to keep track of the spent fuel rods at the Yongbyon nuclear complex; the rods can be reprocessed into weapons-grade plutonium. American intelligence officials say they believe that North Korea may have one or two nuclear weapons and has produced enough bomb-grade plutonium already for several more. The United States has also warned in the past that the North may be trying to turn its abundant supplies of natural uranium into material for weapons, but intelligence experts say they believe that such a program is years behind the country’s plutonium-based efforts. The North made similar vows about a uranium-based program in April, after a rocket test that started the latest confrontation between North Korea and the West. Although thesanctionspassed Friday tightened restrictions, the United States had hoped for more stringent penalties and for mandatory ship inspections. The Obama administration pushed for those inspections because of fears that the impoverished North would try to sell its weapons or nuclear material. North Korea has grown increasingly isolated as it has pressed forward with a nuclear program that many analysts say they now believe is aimed at producing an independent nuclear deterrent rather than being used as a bargaining chip with the West for much needed aid. The long-range missile test in April was part of what many analysts call an effort to produce a delivery system capable of reaching the United States. There have been signs in recent weeks that the North may be preparing for yet another missile test. “It has become an absolutely impossible option for the D.P.R.K. to even think about giving up its nuclear weapons,” Saturday’s statement said, using the initials of the North’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

The youngest son ofNorth Korea’s leader has been given the title of Brilliant Comrade, a newspaper reported on Friday, another sign that the Communist regime is preparing to name him as successor to its leader,Kim Jong-il. Intelligence authorities from the United States and South Korea disclosed this week thatKim Jong-un, 26, is now being referred to in the North  as Yongmyong-han Dongji. That translates roughly as Brilliant Comrade, the South Korean newspaper JoongAng Ilbo reported. The younger Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il-sung, founded North Korea in 1948. He was called the Great Leader. When he died in 1994, his son, Kim Jong-il, became Dear Leader. Kim Jong-il, 67, is believed to have suffered a stroke last year and is said to be grooming Kim Jong-un to succeed him.

Despite the failure of the attempted launch, Pyongyang’s adversaries voiced alarm and the U.N. tumbled into disarray over how to respond on Monday.

SEOUL, South Korea  — Despite the failure ofNorth Korea’s  attempt to launch a satellite, Pyongyang’s  adversaries voiced alarm on Monday over the extended range of the North’s  latest rocket, while theUnited Nationstumbled into a disarray over how to respond to what  President Obama called a “provocative act.” Washington and Seoul said the North Korean rocket launched on Sunday failed to thrust a satellite into orbit. But on Monday,  seeking to garner political gain from the test, the North Korean media praised Kim Jong-il’s leadership, insisting that a communications satellite was circling the Earth, broadcasting patriotic songs. Officials and analysts in Seoul said  the North’s rocket, identified by American officials as a Taepodong-2, flew at least 2,000 miles, doubling the range of an earlier  rocket it tested in 1998 and boosting its potential to fire a long-range missile. The impoverished country may be years away from building a truly intercontinental ballistic missile and tipping it with a nuclear warhead. But to governments grown increasingly concerned by the North’s military might, the launch was a sign that it was doggedly moving in that direction. “North Korea’s reckless act of threatening regional and global security cannot have any justification,” said President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea in a radio speech on Monday. Hours after North Korea’s missile test on Sunday, President  Obama called for new United Nations sanctions and laid out a new approach to American nuclear disarmament policy — one intended to strengthen the United States and its allies in halting proliferation. “In a strange turn of history, the threat of global nuclear war has gone down, but the risk of a nuclear attack has gone up,” Mr. Obama told a huge crowd in the square outside of Prague Castle.  “Black market trade in nuclear secrets and nuclear materials abound. The technology to build a bomb has spread.” He said the North’s testing of “a rocket that could be used for long-range missiles” illustrated “the need for action, not just this afternoon at the U.N. Security Council, but in our determination to prevent the spread of these weapons.” “Rules must be binding,” he said. “Violations must be punished. Words must mean something.” At the Security Council on Sunday,  the United States and its main allies — Japan, France and Britain —pushed for a resolution denouncing the test  as a violation of the 2006 sanctions, which demanded that North Korea suspend any activity related to the launching of ballistic missiles. Diplomats said a main issue would be determining if the failed launch violated any resolutions. “We think that what was launched is not the issue; the fact that there was a launch using ballistic missile technology is itself a clear violation,” said Susan E. Rice, the U.S. ambassador. China left its position ambiguous, although diplomats said that at the initial meeting it stressed that the North Koreans had a right like any other country to launch satellites. “Our position is that all countries concerned should show restraint and refrain from taking actions that might lead to increased tensions,” Zhang Yesui, the Chinese ambassador, told reporters. Igor N. Shcherbak, the Russian deputy envoy, said that his country did not think it was a violation of the resolutions banning ballistic missiles, but he added that Russia was still studying the matter. Mexican Ambassador Claude Heller, the council’s president, said the council would reconvene on Monday. In Tokyo, Foreign Minister Hirofumi Nakasone said: “We feel that a Security Council resolution is desirable, so we will keep trying for that.” Although the debris of the North Korean rocket fell hundreds of kilometers short of where the North had said they would land in the Pacific, “the launch carries big political and military significance,” said Jeung Young-tai, an analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul. “No country will be naive enough to believe that it was a peaceful space program,” Mr. Jeung said. “North Korea is on the threshold of becoming an intercontinental ballistic missile country.” Peter Hayes, director of the Nautilus Institute, a San Francisco-based think tank, said the main motivation behind the launch was “to demonstrate the strength and vitality of Kim Jong Il’s leadership to the military and the population, and for the scientific sector to declare its fealty to Kim Jong Il’s leadership.” Kim is expected to be re-affirmed as leader by his rubber-stamp parliament, which convenes on Thursday. The people in the tightly isolated country have little access to news from the outside world, where the satellite launch was considered a failure. When North Korea first flight-tested the Taepodong-2, in July 2006, it blew apart 40 seconds after take-off. The rocket is designed to fly at least 6,700 kilometers, or 4,200 miles, according the South Korean Defense Ministry. This time, the official KCNA news agency asserted, “storms of hurrays shook the room” as the satellite entered orbit.

North Korea has placed a long-range missile on a launch pad before a test that the U.S., Japan and South Korea said would violate a U.N. Security Council resolution, a news report said Thursday.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreahas placed a long-range missile on a launch pad before a test that the United States, Japan and South Korea said would violate a United Nations Security Council resolution, a news report said Thursday. Spy satellites detected what looked to be a Taepodong-2 missile in place Tuesday at the Musudan-ri launch site near North Korea’s northeastern coast, said Chosun Ilbo, South Korea’s leading daily, quoting an unidentified diplomatic source. Once the rocket is installed on the pad, missile experts said, the North Koreans can technically launch it within three or four days — the time needed for the fueling of a three-stage rocket. North Korea has said it would launch a rocket over Japan and the Pacific between April 4 and 8 to deliver an experimental communications satellite into orbit. But Washington, Tokyo and Seoul have said the launch is a cover for testing its Taepodong-2 ballistic missile. Both missions — the satellite and the ballistic missile — use the same rocket technology. If North Korea successfully launches its rocket, it would demonstrate that the North has the technological skills to send up a missile that could travel as far as the western United States. Washington and its allies also consider North Korea’s missile program an additional threat because the North has sold missile technology to the Middle East and is developingnuclear weaponsthat could potentially be loaded on its missiles. After North Korea detonated its first nuclear device in 2006, the Security Council adopted a resolution banning North Korea from further nuclear and missile tests. Washington warned that it would seek punishment at the Security Council — probably more sanctions on the already isolated country — if it goes ahead with the planned launch. And Japan has vowed to press for new sanctions if the rocket is tested. But North Korea warned this week that further sanctions would cause it to quit the so-called six-party talks. The United States, South Korea, Japan, China and Russia have been trying for years to persuade North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons programs in return for economic aid. The North’s defiance is the first major test for President Obama in dealing with Pyongyang. “We intend to raise this violation of the Security Council resolution, if it goes forward, in the U.N.,” U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Wednesday. “This provocative action in violation of the U.N. mandate will not go unnoticed, and there will be consequences.” South Korea fears that a launch would raise military tensions, discouraging foreign investors away from South Korea amid a global recession. Seoul also favors punishing North Korea for a rocket launching. Won Tae-je, spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry, declined to confirm the news report but said a launching would be “a serious challenge and provocation against the security on the Korean Peninsula and regional stability in Northeast Asia.” A successful launch in the first week of April would give a timely boost to the domestic reputation of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il. The country’s parliament is scheduled to convene April 9 to re-elect him as leader. Mr. Kim, 67, was reported to have suffered a stroke last August. His declining heath has raised questions about his grip on power and the future of his regime, where no clear successor has emerged. Some U.S. officials, including Adm. Timothy Keating, the head of U.S. Pacific Command, have said the United States has a capability to knock down any North Korean missile heading for U.S. territory. But such an intercept is highly unlikely, according to experts in Seoul, because Washington is trying to win the release of two television journalists North Korea recently detained. The North has charged them with illegally crossing the Chinese-North Korean border.

North Korea says it will launch a satellite in early April, a move viewed by the United States, Japan and South Korea as “provocative” and tantamount to a missile test.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreasaid Tuesday that if the United States pushed forUnited Nationssanctions against it after its planned satellite launching, that would spell a definitive end to the stalled six-nation talks on ending itsnuclear weaponsprogram. North Korea says it will launch a satellite between April 4 and 8. The United States, Japan and South Korea consider the launching  tantamount to a missile test and have all warned that they would try to punish what they called a “provocative” move in theUnited Nations Security Council. They say that for North Korea, a country that has hardly enough money to feed its own people, the costly satellite program is nothing but a disguise for testing its long-range ballistic missile technology because  launching a satellite and a ballistic missile uses the same technology. The North derides that conclusion. “It is perversity to say satellite launch technology cannot be distinguished from a long-range missile technology,” a spokesman for the North’s Foreign Ministry was quoted as saying on Tuesday by the country’s official news agency,K.C.N.A. That “is like saying a kitchen knife is no different from a bayonet,” said the spokesman, who was not named in the report, adding that the United States and Japan had put satellites into  orbit. After North Korea detonated a nuclear device for the first time in 2006, the Security Council adopted a resolution banning North Korea from further nuclear and ballistic missile tests. On Tuesday, North Korea said that any attempt within the Security Council to punish its satellite launching would mean the end of the landmark accord signed by North Korea, the United States, China, South Korea, Japan and Russia on Sept. 19, 2005. The agreement called for North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program in return for economic aid, diplomatic recognition and a security guarantee from the United States. Washington’s “hostility toward us” violates the “mutual respect and the spirit of equality” contained in the agreement, the spokesman said, and compels the North to continue to build its nuclear deterrent, he added. The six-nation talks on how to carry out the accord have been stumbling for years, most recently in a dispute over how to verify North Korea’s accounting of its nuclear assets, including its plutonium-based nuclear arsenal and a suspected uranium enrichment program. “If the Sept. 19 joint statement is nullified, there will be neither the foundation nor the meaning for the existence of the six-party talks,” the North Korean spokesman said. His statement is the latest in a recent series of  pointed statements from the North. Analysts in the region see the belligerent language and the planned launching as part of North Korea’s attempt to raise tensions to extract concessions from the United States and South Korea. On Tuesday, South Korea’s top nuclear negotiator, Wi Sung-lac, arrived in Beijing to meet with the Chinese vice foreign minister, Wu Dawei, before heading to Washington for discussions. Neighboring governments want China, the North’s major ally and its biggest provider of aid and trade, to exercise its influence on North Korea. Without Chinese support, international sanctions have only limited impact on the North Korean government, which has survived decades of isolation. But Beijing remains wary of American moves to increase economic pressure on North Korea. North Korea’s prime minister, Kim Yong-il, visited Beijing last week and met with President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, both of whom urged the country to resume negotiations.

Foreign movies in the closed land of North Korea keep both the audience and the censor alert.

PYONGYANG, North Korea HUMOR may not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of the citizens of North Korea, a country known mostly for militant anti-Western propaganda, chronic food shortages and an internationally isolated government pursuing nuclear weapons. And yet audiences at the 11th Pyongyang International Film Festival here clearly enjoyed themselves this fall during screenings of Western dramas and comedies, occasionally even erupting into riotous laughter. In most other countries movies like Marcus H. Rosenmüller’s“Heavyweights,”a lighthearted comedy about a group of Bavarian villagers contending in the 1952 Winter Olympics, would be harmless fun. But not in North Korea, and to prove it there was a man with a piece of cardboard sitting in the projection room to cover the lens in case anything deemed unseemly to Korean eyes was shown. That day, mercifully, the cardboard-wielding censor wasn’t particularly good at his job. His hapless attempts to maintain officially sanctioned decency only added to the amusement of the 2,000 moviegoers in the gigantic Pyongyang International Cinema House, who responded energetically to the sight of a half-dozen outsize German bobsledders baring their bottoms and stuffing themselves with food and beer to gain weight for a competition. It was an unusual sight in this corner of the world, to say the least. After more than a decade of natural disasters, famine and economic mismanagement, everyday life is no laughing matter for the 23 million Koreans north of the demilitarized zone, which has separated the Koreas since the end of the war between the two countries in 1953. For the past 60 years they have lived under the rule of just two men: the founder of North Korea, Kim Il-sung, who died in 1994, and his son Kim Jong-il. Mr. Kim, who is known to be a film buff and connoisseur of Hollywood movies, reportedly finances a three-story building in Pyongyang with a full-time staff of 250 that houses his collection of 20,000 films from all over the world. Regular citizens must settle for homegrown propaganda movies like “Five Guerilla Brothers,” “An Azalea Behind Enemy Lines” and “Wormwood Rice Cake, National Food.” But the festival, which ran from Sept. 17 to 26 and screened more than 100 films from at least 45 nations,  including China, Russia, France and Italy (though not the United States, Japan or South Korea), offered a rare chance for ordinary North Koreans to get a glimpse of the outside world. An estimated 120,000 tickets were sold or distributed at workplaces throughout the city. Movies like Britain’s“Elizabeth: The Golden Age,”Germany’s “And Along Came Tourists” and the Chinese war drama“Assembly,”which carried off the festival prize as best film, played before full houses. Such was the run on tickets that large crowds had to be turned back by uniformed guards, and doors were chained once performances started. After arriving, audience members were told through loudspeakers to sit in their own chairs and not leave any trash behind. (No one needed to be reminded to switch off their cellphones, as they are illegal in North Korea and all international visitors have to leave theirs at the airport on arrival.) Most screenings took place at the International Cinema House, an imposing concrete structure built on an island in the Taedong River, which flows through the capital. Unlike earlier festivals, this one had no physical barriers separating North Koreans from foreigners — mostly producers, distributors and movie executives — although the official “guides” were keen to prevent any contact with the locals. The festival is not your usual red-carpet, celebrity-studded affair. Or is it, just with a North Korean accent? Both in popular culture and as a propaganda tool, film is a central element of contemporary life here, and North Korean cinema has its own star system. Famous actors are depicted on murals around the city and even on official currency. “Kim Jong-il sees film as a highly effective tool to maintain his power,” Suk-Young Kim, a scholar of Korean film at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said in a telephone interview. “For him, it’s one of the primary means of governing.” The closest you get to the Hollywood walk of fame is probably the Cemetery of the Patriotic Martyrs in the suburbs of Pyongyang, where a number of famous performers are buried. Mind you, they owe their fame largely to one person, and they know it. “The ordinary film artists,” a booklet titled “Great Man and Art” informs the English reader, “have been able to ascend the high eminence of immortality under the special care of Comrade Kim Jong-il, their benevolent teacher and father.” Speaking after a screening of the film“Flower Girl”(1972), the actress Hong Young-hee recalled the advice Mr. Kim gave her on the set: “The great general advised me how to wear my straw shoes properly and gave me meticulous guidance in acting, costume and props.” It was difficult to break free from the official program, given the tight schedule of visits to sites honoring the exploits of the two Kims combined with the remote island location of the festival cinema and the hotel where most foreign visitors stayed. Any detour had to be applied for at least a day in advance, and even then the answer would often be a curiously diplomatic “Maybe it is impossible.” It was only after much persuasion that I managed to get into a screening at the Kaeson cinema in downtown Pyongyang, which was decorated with propaganda slogans and a heroic mural showing the two Kims. A large crowd of North Koreans seemed to enjoy“When the Raven Flies,”an unspeakably bad 1984 movie about murderous Vikings in medieval Iceland that was not improved by being (like all other foreign films here) voiced-over in Korean. But perhaps it was a welcome change of pace from fare like “We Are the Happiest” and “Affection-Permeated Land.” Generally speaking, historical dramas or films from countries like Iran and Bangladesh are deemed less dangerous ideologically here than contemporary films from the West, which would expose North Koreans to a tempting display of Western life and wealth. Even so, the festival came with a health warning. At the opening ceremony the culture minister, Kang Nung-su, cautioned that filmgoing “must not harm the sound mind of the people.” By all accounts economic difficulties have resulted in a dramatic decline in both the output and the quality of North Korean cinema. “We are now making only two to three feature films a year,” an official from the Korean Film Export and Import Corporation said, adding, “They’re not very good.” One exception at the festival was “A Schoolgirl’s Diary” (2006), the most recent film from the prominent North Korean director Jang In-hak. The tale of a young girl whose father is working on a mysterious project far from home, it was a box office hit here, attracting an impressive eight million viewers, according to official figures, and even made it to Cannes. “It’s a very particular movie, which conveys rather well what one’s life should be” in North Korea, said James Velaise, whose company, Pretty Pictures, is distributing the film in France. The only new North Korean film, on the other hand, was “The Kites Flying in the Sky” (2008), based on a true story of a woman who gives up her career as a marathon runner to care for orphaned children. The foreign delegates were mostly critical, calling the scriptwriting incoherent and propagandistic. “Everyone loves movies,” Mr. Jang said over coffee at a hotel bar, “but there is no one who loves them as much as the Dear Leader. He is a genius of filmmaking.” To prove his point he recounted how Mr. Kim ordered several dozen directors, screenwriters and cinematographers to attend movie boot camp several years ago. Holed up in a special hotel for six months, they watched more than 200 movies — a varied group that included“Gone With the Wind,”“Schindler’s List,”“Saving Private Ryan,”“Braveheart”and“Troy”— and reported their observations about filmmaking techniques in letters to the Dear Leader. Mr. Kim was unable to attend the boot camp, Mr. Jang said, “but he called us almost every day, sometimes in the early hours in the morning, to tell us what to look for in terms of story writing, acting and editing.”

Millions of people in the country are facing “severe deprivations” not seen since the mid-1990s, according to a newly released U.N. report.

UNITED NATIONS—North Koreais facing its worst food crisis in a decade, with a large shortfall expected this year, according to a new report released by the United Nations on Thursday. At the same time, the number of children suffering from diarrhea has increased sharply. Millions of people in the country are facing “severe deprivations” not seen since the mid-1990s, the report said, with the shortfall of food expected to reach more than one and a half million tons this year. While the military and the elite are not suffering from cutbacks, more than three-quarters of all households have reduced their food consumption and more than half are eating only two meals per day, the report said. “Sadly, even though the harvest was getting better, we have had devastating floods in 2006 and 2007,” Vitit Muntarbhorn, the author of the report, said at a news conference. “Over the past year we have had very worrying information of a very chronic food shortage.” Mr. Muntarbhorn, a Thai law professor who serves as the special rapporteur for human rights in North Korea, has not been allowed to enter the country. Child malnutrition and illnesses have been rising, with nearly twice as many children suffering from diarrhea than the number recorded in the last United Nations nutritional survey conducted with the government in 2004, the report said. Two-thirds of the country’s 23 million people have a poor diet, it said. TheWorld Food Program, which started a special program to reach 1.9 million North Koreans in 2006, is now expanding it in the hopes of helping 6.5 million people, Mr. Muntarbhorn said. The government has been more cooperative with the program, he said, allowing the agency to monitor the distribution of aid and to conduct some random checks at the local level. The report painted a grim picture of other human rights issues in North Korea, perhaps the world’s most closed country. Government permission is required to own a cellphone or computer, and radios come preset to the government station. Mr. Muntarbhorn said that continuing talks aimed at haltingNorth Korea’s nuclear weaponsprogram excluded human rights issues, but should be used to provide some leverage for improving the human rights situation. The talks are being conducted by a group of nations that include the United States, Russia, China, Japan and South Korea.

Rumors about Kim Jong-il’s condition run rampant, but analysts say it appears to be business as usual in North Korea.

CHEORWON, South Korea — When Kim Il-sung, the revered North Korean founder and president, died in 1994, the demilitarized zone between the Koreas became what soldiers and civilian residents in this frontier town remember as “an opera house of funeral songs.” For 10 days, the North Korean propaganda loudspeakers filled the air with dirges and Soviet-style funeral marches, so heavy in mood that one resident said “it felt like a dark cloud.” Now reports are saying that Kim Il-sung’s son,Kim Jong-il, the current leader, has had a stroke. Rumors about his condition run rampant. ButNorth Korea, which may be the world’s most secretive nation, has betrayed no signs of unrest so far. Officials and analysts in Seoul, the South Korean capital, say it appears to be business as usual. “We see no unusual movement from the North Korean military at all,” Lt. Col. Jeon Chang-ho said Thursday, gazing across the quiet, verdant DMZ from the South Korean Army’s Cheorwon Peace Observatory. South Korea fears that a power vacuum in the North would send a flood of refugees southward that it could not absorb. This week, North Korea’s state-run news media have said Mr. Kim has been going about his usual chores and sending letters to foreign leaders and wreaths to national cemeteries. But they did not actually show him doing anything, a conspicuous omission. “It’s all nonsense spread by bad people who wish ill for our country,” Hyon Hak-bong, a North Korean diplomat, told South Korean reporters on Friday in Panmunjom, near the border. He was at a meeting on energy aid promised to the North in return for disabling its nuclear weapons programs. Reports about Mr. Kim’s health surged after he failed to appear at the parade on the Sept. 9 anniversary of the North’s founding. The South Korean government has said it believes that Mr. Kim, 66,  had a stroke but that he is recovering fast, his power unchallenged. It has given no details. Mr. Kim  is not known to have groomed a successor, whether one of his three sons or anyone else. His control and his country’s isolation are so complete that no one outside the North can say who is in or out of favor. The absence of facts is fertile ground for unrestrained speculation. News reports citing unnamed sources — or no sources — have proliferated. “At least North Korea doesn’t sue you,” journalists in Seoul say. Depending on which Seoul newspaper one reads, Mr. Kim’s condition varies from “four limbs paralyzed” to “spasms after a brain surgery” to “able to brush his own teeth.” Lee Cheol-woo, a legislator briefed by the government’s spy agency, duly reported that Mr. Kim “can speak and stand if assisted.” Mainichi, a newspaper in Japan, quoted an unnamed Chinese source as saying that Mr. Kim began losing consciousness at work in April and could not properly govern. Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Waseda University in Tokyo, has claimed that Mr. Kim died in 2003, with only body doubles being seen since then. Mr. Kim’s taste for rich foods and his habit of working into the night have been blamed for his reported stroke. But South Korean newspapers also say he may have collapsed after Kim Jong-un, 25, his youngest son, was seriously injured in a car accident.

To the Editor: Re “North Koreans Welcome Symphonic Diplomacy” (news article, Feb. 27): Much as I welcome the New York Philharmonic’s role in peacemaking, if a family memory serves as precedent, it may be some time before the orchestra’s visit to North Korea has any positive effect. In 1956, my father, Leonard Burkat, who was at that time the music administrator of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, traveled with the orchestra to the Soviet Union, where it played before the country’s leaders and on radio and television. The tour was underwritten in part by the United States State Department and was said to be the first visit by an American orchestra to the Soviet Union after World War II. Its goal was clear: to help that country and the United States break down the large barriers that separated them. Unfortunately, it took 35 more years and the end of Communist rule to really make that happen. Howard BurkatHastings-on-Hudson, Feb. 27, 2008  To the Editor: The White House dismissed the significance of the New York Philharmonic’s concert in Pyongyang as neither hurting nor helping our diplomatic efforts in North Korea. The emotional outpouring of appreciation by people weaned on anti-Americanism for decades points in a different direction. The concert was not the “axis of evil” threat of a bully, but the face and voice of the American people. If a concert in Pyongyang, why not in Tehran? Why not in Havana? The objection that such events tend to legitimize the host government is absurd. Donald E. SmithWayne, Pa., Feb. 27, 2008  To the Editor: As a native New Yorker, I find it embarrassing to see one of the city’s most prestigious institutions act so naïvely and without regard to the millions who have been abused, jailed, tortured and executed by the dictatorships of Kim Jong-il and his father, Kim Il-sung. Aren’t we New Yorkers supposed to be a street-smart bunch, progressive and concerned with those less fortunate around the world? Instead, the members of the New York Philharmonic played for well-off party dignitaries, while the real North Korean population is starving and living in sections of the Korean Peninsula that many foreign observers have described as almost prison camps. During the 1980s, many artists and performers rightly refused to interact with apartheid South Africa. It’s hypocritical to now see no problem with a cultural exchange with one of the most repressive dictatorships in the world. Mario RamirezWantagh, N.Y., Feb. 27, 2008

The president wrote a letter to Kim Jong-il, his first direct communication with the reclusive North Korean dictator.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 — President Bush, directly engaging the man he publicly called a “tyrant,” wrote a letter toNorth Korea’s leader,Kim Jong-il, in which he held out the prospect of normalized relations with the United States if North Korea fully disclosed its nuclear programs and dismantled its nuclear reactor, administration officials said Thursday. The high-level personal missive from Mr. Bush to the leader of the country he placed in his “axis of evil” in 2002 was sent as American negotiators  struggle to get the secretive North Korean government to fully explain and disclose the extent, use and spread of its nuclear material and technology. At the same time, the United States is also urging other nations to maintain pressure on Iran in the wake of a new assessment that Tehran halted nuclear weapons work in 2003. Mr. Bush addressed the letter  “Dear Mr. Chairman,” and urged the enigmatic North Korean leader to disclose all of his country’s past and present nuclear work. “I want to emphasize that the declaration must be complete and accurate if we are to continue our progress,” the letter said, according to a senior administration official. The letter closed, “Sincerely,George W. Bush.” It was signed by hand, administration officials said. While administration officials described the letter as straightforward, its very existence underscores just how much the White House wants to ensure that one of the administration’s scarce, tangible diplomatic accomplishments does not slip away. North Korea agreed in October to dismantle all of its nuclear facilities and to disclose all of its past and present nuclear programs by the end of the year in return for about a million tons  of fuel oil or its equivalent in economic aid. That agreement has come under fierce criticism from national security hawks, but many foreign policy experts point to it as a rare diplomatic success in a period that has been dominated by frustration in Iran, the Middle East and Pakistan. The White House declined to provide copies of the letter and sought to minimize its significance by pointing out that Mr. Bush had written letters to the leaders of all the other countries in the so-called six-party group that had been working to end North Korea’s nuclear program. “In these letters, the president reiterated our commitment to the six-party talks and stressed the need for North Korea to come forward with a full and complete declaration of their nuclear programs, as called for in the September 2005 six-party agreement,” said Gordon D. Johndroe, a White House spokesman. But Mr. Bush talks to the leaders of the other countries — China, Russia, Japan and South Korea — on a regular basis. And the letters were not identical, administration officials said. “The letter to Kim Jong-il speaks of the six-party process and its historical mission, and lays out a vision of normalization and complete denuclearization,” a senior administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment on the letters publicly. “They are all different.” Another administration official said the letter emphasized the need to resolve three sticking points: the number of warheads North Korea built, the amount of weapons-grade nuclear material it produced and the need for North Korea to disclose what nuclear material and knowledge it has received from other countries and what nuclear material and knowledge it has passed on to other countries. The proliferation issue has taken on new importance since an Israeli strike in Syria in September, which administration and Israeli officials say was conducted against a nuclear plant near the Euphrates River that was supplied with material from North Korea. Administration officials want North Korea to disclose what help it may have given Syria, although they also acknowledge that any such assistance occurred before North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear reactor and disclose its nuclear programs. Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice indicated on Thursday that Dec. 31 was not a hard and fast deadline for the disclosure, and that it could slip a few days or even weeks. The letter to Mr. Kim is dated Dec. 1, administration officials said. Mr. Hill delivered it to his North Korean counterpart in Beijing on Wednesday. Within hours, North Korea announced that Mr. Kim had received the letter. The White House letter is a huge reversal from the veritable cold war that has existed between Mr. Bush and Mr. Kim for most of the Bush administration. In 2002, Mr. Bush referred to Mr. Kim as a “pygmy” and compared him to a “spoiled child at a dinner table” during a meeting with Republican senators, according to news reports at the time. In his State of the Union address that same year, Mr. Bush called Mr. Kim’s government “a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction, while starving its citizens.” During a news conference in 2005, Mr. Bush called Mr. Kim a “tyrant” and said he maintained “concentration camps.” The letter struck a more cordial tone. “I would describe it as a presidential letter to another leader of a country,” said Dana Perino, the White House press secretary. Mr. Hill, who was recently in North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang, and was in Beijing on Wednesday for meetings with some of his counterparts in the talks, has advised the North to make a full disclosure of its nuclear programs, as it agreed to in October. North Korea seemed to be on the verge of making a limited disclosure, perhaps as a negotiating ploy before Dec. 31, the tentative deadline, administration officials said. Administration officials are walking something of a tightrope between pressing hard for the declaration and compromising with North Korean negotiators to get one and declare victory. Several senior officials said they were mindful of criticism from national security hawks in Washington, who do not want to see a deal go through because they do not believe that North Korea will abide by it. “This is like Lucy and Charlie Brown and the football,” said John R. Bolton, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations. “How many times are we going to go through this with them?”

The deputy chief of the U.N. Development Program said the American accusations far surpassed what the program had at its disposal.

UNITED NATIONS, June 28 — The deputy chief of the United Nations Development Program has shot back at American accusations that it had squandered millions of dollars inNorth Korea, saying the amount far surpassed what the program had at its disposal and questioning the authenticity of documents the American mission provided to back up its claims. In a confidential letter delivered Thursday evening to Zalmay Khalilzad, the United States ambassador, the official, Ad Melkert, said the money amounts, vendor names and transaction dates supplied by the United States had been examined against his agency’s records and “there is not a single match.” He said the volume of payments that the Americans claimed that the program had made to North Korean government entities was “significantly higher” than the total that the office had for all purposes in the country. American officials have said their charges stem from internal business records of the program, but Mr. Melkert challenged the veracity of seven supporting documents that the United States mission supplied in a June 15 meeting. Those were presented as being files from 2001 and 2002, but he said his office had determined that they had been generated under a computer coding system put into effect in 2004. The documents, he said, “show U.N.D.P. corporate system codes not in use by U.N.D.P. in those years.” Noting that the United States had termed the evidence made available so far “sample documents,” Mr. Melkert asked Mr. Khalilzad to furnish all of the documentation substantiating the American claims. The letter is the latest in a series of frosty exchanges between Mr. Melkert and American officials in the six months since Mark D. Wallace, the deputy American ambassador for management, accused the program of serving as “a steady and large source of hard currency” for the North Korean government. The program, Mr. Wallace wrote then, has been “systematically perverted for the benefit of the Kim Jong-il regime rather than the people of North Korea,” and he suggested that the United Nations money might have ended up financing North Korea’s nuclear program. The new letter was made available by an official interested in combating the wide attention that the American allegations had received through briefings by Mr. Wallace for selected news outlets, editorial writers, members of Congress and nations that finance the development program. A note sent to participants in a briefing by Mr. Wallace before a subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on May 23 promised “many parallels to the oil-for-food scandal” and evidence of “a direct link between U.N. assistance and the North Korean missile programs.” Mr. Melkert complained in a previous letter that the briefings failed to mention the rebuttals supplied by his office to each set of allegations. Asked Thursday afternoon about the months of charge and countercharge, Mr. Wallace noted that Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and Kemal Dervis, the development program’s chief, had committed themselves to look into the matter. “I think the U.S. certainly looks forward to the U.N.D.P.’s constructive and technical inquiry into the program, a program that appears to have lost its way,” he said. The original January accusation from Mr. Wallace prompted the development program’s executive board that same month to order an end to the practice of furnishing payments in hard currency to the North Korean government and to making in-country hiring subject to government approval. In March, after North Korea resisted those conditions, the agency announced that it was suspending operations in the country, curtailing 20 programs with an overall budget of $4.4 million. The programs dealt with agricultural recovery and rural energy development, according to the development program’s Web site. On June 1 a preliminary United Nations audit offered no support for the charge that systematic large-scale diversions to the North Korean government had occurred, but it said the program had broken its own rules by hiring workers selected by the government and paying them in foreign currency. Then the United States raised a series of new charges, and program officials responded to each point. To Mr. Wallace’s charge that the program had transferred $7 million to its counterpart agency in the North Korean government, the program said that the amount actually had been $175,000 and that most of it had gone for  workshops on vegetable growing and seed processing. The program reiterated the same $175,000 figure in reply to a second allegation: that an additional $2.8 million in program money had gone to North Korean missions in New York and Europe and had been used to purchase buildings and houses in Britain, France and Canada. The agency also turned aside Mr. Wallace’s accusations that it had procured equipment for North Korea that could be put to military use. It said the equipment, which included global positioning systems, personal computers and a portable spectrometer, an optical device, had been purchased under a program, common in developing nations, that monitors natural disasters and helps to estimate crop yields. Mr. Melkert also denied that his agency had paid $2.7 million to the Zang Lok Trading Company, a banking institution based in Macao that Mr. Wallace said was linked to a North Korean financial agent involved in weapons sales. According to banking records, Mr. Melkert said, the development program’s total payments to Zang Lok from 1999 to the present amount to $52,201.95 and went for workshop equipment and computers for Unesco, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and for the World Intellectual Property Organization. The development program had no transactions with Zang Lok on its own account, he said. Totaling up the charges, Mr. Melkert said in his letter to Mr. Khalilzad that “the allegation that U.N.D.P. transferred $15 million in cash to the D.P.R.K. government in the period 2001-2005  is not supported as our banking records show that the country office did not have this magnitude of resources at its disposal.” North Korea’s official name is the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Mr. Melkert said that only an average of $2.5 million a year had been available from 2001 to 2005 and that the sum included all payments made by the country office supporting development program operations and some other United Nations functions. Mr. Wallace has also cited “eyewitness accounts” from unidentified people to support his charges, and he has accused the program of retaliating against one of its employees for revealing information about mismanagement. In a letter Tuesday to the secretary general, Senator Norm Coleman, a Minnesota Republican, identified the employee as Artjon Shkurtaj, the program’s chief of operations in North Korea in 2005 and 2006. David Morrison, the program’s spokesman, said Mr. Shkurtaj left North Korea in August 2006 and left the program in March 2007, after fulfilling several short-term contracts. Senator Coleman said he had been let go because of concerns he had raised and should be afforded whistle-blower protection. Mr. Melkert said Mr. Shkurtaj had been invited to submit his information to the program’s audit office but had declined to do so.

North Koreahas test-fired “several missiles,” the United States said, as United Nations nuclear inspectors prepared to visit the Yongbyon reactor today, which North Korea has promised to shut down. “The United States is deeply troubled that North Korea has decided to launch these missiles during a delicate time in the six-party talks,” said Gordon D. Johndroe, a spokesman for theNational Security Council. He added that the United States expected North Korea “to refrain from conducting further provocative ballistic missile launches.” But a Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Chito Peppler of the Navy, played down the  launchings and said they were short-range missiles.  “We believe that this was a routine exercise,” he said.

U.S. officials say doubts about the progress of North Korea’s uranium enrichment gives the country a face-saving way to surrender its nuclear equipment.
==::==

==::==
WASHINGTON, March 4  —  In an effort to make the best of newly murky intelligence aboutNorth Korea, Bush administration officials say they plan to tell the North’s   nuclear negotiators on Monday that Washington’s doubts about how much progress the country has made in enriching uranium gives  North Korea   a face-saving way to surrender its nuclear equipment. The new approach to solve a  dispute over the existence and extent of  a uranium program, which intelligence agencies say could have been developed  using  equipment that the North Koreans purchased from Pakistan, will come at a meeting with North Korea at theUnited Nations. It is the first session intended  to hammer out a schedule under which North Korea is supposed to  disable its main nuclear plant and then account for all its nuclear programs. Because the agreement includes providing North Korea with  a million tons of fuel oil  before it turns over  its suspected arsenal of nuclear arms and fuel, some of President Bush’s conservative allies have denounced it as a dangerous concession. Mr. Bush has called it a “first step,” though it bears similarities to the kind of deal that the administration rejected in its first term. On Sunday, Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, said that at the meeting he planned to “form an agenda to work on our bilateral relationship —  what’s involved in the establishment of diplomatic relations, what’s involved before North Korea can get off the state-sponsor-of-terrorism list, and how to get them off the Trading with the Enemies Act.” He said he would  be “pressing for disclosure of all their nuclear programs, including highly enriched uranium.” Persuading North Korea to address  that program will be particularly challenging —  both because the North Koreans have denied seeking to enrich uranium and because a top American intelligence official told Congress last week that there was  only moderate confidence that the equipment  North Korea bought had been used. But that ambiguity, officials say, may give North Korea the chance to turn over its equipment with a vague explanation that an effort to produce energy, rather than a bomb, did not work out. That is a very different tone than intelligence officials struck in November 2002, just after American officials told the North Koreans that they had discovered evidence of the purchase of centrifuges, the high-speed devices that enrich uranium, from Abdul Qadeer Khan, the head of Pakistan’s nuclear program. In an unclassified, single-page report distributed to members of Congress at the time, top agency officials, headed by George J. Tenet, then the director of the Central Intelligence Agency,  reported, “We recently learned that the North is constructing a plant that could produce enough weapons-grade uranium for two or more nuclear weapons per year when fully operational —  which could be as soon as mid-decade.” On Friday, three days after the testimony of Joseph DeTrani, the North Korea coordinator for the director of national intelligence, suggesting doubts about the current state of the program, Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan and the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, sent a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates seeking more answers. “Is this still the intelligence community’s assessment?” he asked of the 2002 report. “If not, why, and when did the intelligence community revise this assessment? What is the current intelligence community assessment?” He also asked what underlay the conclusion that an enrichment plant was under construction.

The negotiations appeared near collapse on Sunday over North Korea’s demands for huge shipments of fuel oil and electricity.

BEIJING, Feb. 11 — Negotiations on a step-by-step deal that the Bush administration hopes will leadNorth Koreato give up its nuclear weapons program appeared near collapse on Sunday over North Korea’s demands for huge shipments of fuel oil and electricity before agreeing to a schedule for turning over its nuclear weapons and fuel. The chief American envoy, Christopher R. Hill, said he and North Korea’s envoy, Kim Kye-gwan, held a “lengthy and very frank” meeting on Sunday. But Mr. Hill seemed much less optimistic that a deal could be struck. Negotiators are planning to end the talks on Monday, and other envoys were pessimistic that any breakthrough would emerge on the final day. Meanwhile, a summary of the proposed agreement being circulated among senior policy makers in Washington makes it clear that even if the North agreed to take the listed first steps — sealing its main nuclear reactor and inviting international inspectors back into the country — there was no specified time period during which it would  be required to turn over any nuclear weapons or weapons fuel that it has produced in recent years.  And such a turnover would happen  only after reaching another agreement. In essence, the agreement Mr. Hill, an assistant secretary of state, is negotiating could prevent the North from producing more weapons, but defers discussions over the weapons and fuel it has stockpiled. Mr. Hill had earlier suggested that if there was agreement, follow-up talks could be set up in March and April. The summary calls for all six nations in the talks — the others are South Korea, Japan, China and Russia — to “create working groups for full and rapid implementation” of a September 2005 agreement in which the North agreed in principle to abandon its nuclear weapons. But in the past, the North Korean envoys to similar working groups have proven to have no real negotiating authority. Furthermore, the proposed agreement sets no dates on nuclear action beyond shutting down the nuclear plant at Yongbyon and allowing inspectors in within 60 days; it leaves unresolved what the North would get in return. The summary was given to The New York Times by a person trying to explain the timing and vagueness of the deal’s elements. After months of preparation that created unusual optimism within the Bush administration, failure to reach even a preliminary agreement could cast doubt on the prospects of disarming North Korea in the administration’s last two years. Several Asian diplomats said  they feared that North Korea had sensed the American distraction in Iraq and could be trying to run out the clock until the election of a new president. At the same time, the North is under pressure because of the effectiveness of financial sanctions, particularly those aimed at Kim Jong-il and other North Korean leaders, and it may feel this is a good time to extract concessions from the South Korean government, which is clinging to economic ties to the North. Mr. Hill, a seasoned negotiator who played a critical role in the Dayton accords that ended conflict in the Balkans in 1995, made it clear that the United States would not sign a deal that provided North Korea with energy but failed to ensure that it gave up its nuclear material. “We’re not looking to provide energy assistance so that they could avoid taking the further steps on denuclearization,” he said at a news conference late Sunday in Beijing. “We understand that you can’t just get there in one jump, you have to take several steps, so we’re prepared to take several steps.” He added, “But we’re not interested in providing that kind of assistance so that they don’t have to take the next step.” In the past, the North has always insisted that it get rewards before giving away the nuclear ability that Mr. Kim regards as his sole international bargaining chip. Kyodo, the Japanese news agency, has reported that North Korea wants an annual energy package of two million tons of fuel oil and two million kilowatts of electricity for taking the first steps in the agreement. It quoted unidentifed diplomatic contacts who said the North also wanted a short-term infusion of hundreds of thousands of tons of fuel oil almost immediately. That presumably would be a reward for shutting down Yongbyon, even though it  does not provide electric energy. Any deal would inevitably be compared with the 1994 agreement between the Clinton administration and North Korea. President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice have  criticized that accord because it involved a “freeze” on activity that the North could quickly reverse, and because it left the shipment of weapons and fuel out of the country to the very end. The agreement fell apart in 2002, and the North is believed to have then converted its spent nuclear fuel into weapons. The North tested its first nuclear device in October, though with only partial success. Outside experts familiar with the outlines of the proposed deal say that the Bush administration would give up relatively little at the beginning,  but it would also receive little. “Freezing and disabling Yongbyon is an important but modest step,” said Michael Green, who negotiated with North Korea as the top Asia expert at the National Security Council until he left a year ago. “It does not yet capture harvested plutonium and the existing weapons.” If a deal holds together, he said, “the key will be retaining leverage” on the North by preventing China, Russia and South Korea from increasing their economic cooperation so much that that their actions negate the United Nations Security Council sanctions on the North. According to the outline, the proposed agreement would establish “tight timelines for actions that are measured in months, not years,” and would include a flurry of moves in the first 60 days, among them the closing of the Yongbyon facilities. Inspectors would return to the country for the first time in more than four years, and the North would have to declare “all of its existing nuclear programs.” That is a reference to the American accusation that the North has a hidden program to enrich uranium, purchased from the rogue Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan. The North once admitted to the existence of the program, American officials say, but has since denied it. The working groups outlined by the proposed agreement would discuss denuclearization, economic and energy cooperation, normalization of diplomatic relations, and a peace treaty formally ending the Korean War. The North’s commitments, the document says, “are to all five other parties, including China,” and it says that “conventional energy assistance will be determined by the working group and will be commensurate with the steps” North Korea takes to fulfill its commitments. The huge annual energy package North Korea is demanding would eclipse the aid provided under the 1994 deal, when the North was promised light-water nuclear reactors with a generating capacity of two million kilowatts of electricity, as well as a temporary fix of 500,000 tons of heavy fuel oil. The chief Japanese envoy, Kenichiro Sasae, told Kyodo, “The problem is that North Korea has excessive expectations about this, and unless it reconsiders this issue, an agreement will be difficult.” North Korea’s insistence on the package deflated the optimism that had infused the early days of this round of talks and spread to senior officials in the White House, who said they expected a deal this weekend. By Sunday afternoon, diplomats had decided that Monday would be the final day of talks, agreement or no. According to Reuters, South Korea’s representative, Chun Yung-woo, blamed the size of the energy package “and the scope, pace and range of the North’s actions to denuclearize” for the stalemate. The Russian envoy, Aleksandr Losyukov, suggested that the best outcome might be a “chairman’s statement” by China that summarized the negotiations. “It seems the chances to reach a joint statement are slim,” Mr. Losyukov said, according to Xinhua, China’s official news agency.

North Korea’s federation appealed the ban on its team because one member, Hong Su Jong, falsified her age. The team and Hong were barred for 30 days last week because she entered the world championships, which begin Saturday in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, using the third birth date of her career. Hong listed her birth year as 1989, although International Gymnastics Federation documents show that she competed at the 2004 Athens Olympics and the 2006 world championships using a birth year of 1985. She won the silver medal on vault at the 2007 worlds listing 1986 as her birth year. If Hong was born in 1989, she would have been ineligible to compete in Athens. Gymnasts must turn at least 16 in the calendar year of an Olympics to be eligible.

Who knew “Mad Men” had hit Pyongyang? North Korea makes an attempt to create brand awareness.

WASHINGTON WHO knew “Mad Men” had hit Pyongyang? Or so it seemed last week, when the North Korean governmentreleased photographs of a rare meeting of the Korean Workers’ Party, and delegates were seen walking purposefully through Pyongyang Station on their way to formally designate the next ruler of the Kim dynasty. That would beKim Jong-un, son of the ailing Dear Leader,Kim Jong-il, and grandson of the Great Leader, Kim Il-sung. The delegates wore suits of nearly identical, somewhat boxy cut, and carried 1960s-style briefcases that the admen of the AMC television series might have swung on Madison Avenue. It was a flashback for anyone lucky enough to have ever strolled the empty streets of Pyongyang, a capital in a time machine, with its Stalin-era ceremonial buildings and limousines that could have fit the Kennedy era. Like the Mad Men, the attendees at the Korean Workers’ Party session were trying to create brand awareness — and they don’t have much time to do so. Pyongyang had decades to build up mythologies about how Grandpa Kim singlehandedly ousted the Japanese, and how Papa Kim offered benevolent “guidance” in building each factory. But the last transition unfolded over 20 years. With Kim Jong-il clearly sick, this transition has to be fast, which is why Kim Jong-un went from civilian to four-star general in an announcement on the state radio. It is also why the photographs last week were read so carefully here in Washington. There were hints of whatNorth Korea’s leaders wish the world to see, and what they hope nobody will notice. “These are pictures about one united party, one enduring bloodline,” said Nicholas Eberstadt of theAmerican Enterprise Institute, “and an obstinate refusal to change direction.”

The sanctions, announced by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, aim to cut off sources of hard currency. 
==::==
2010-07-22T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — The Obama administration announced Wednesday that it would impose further economic sanctions againstNorth Korea, throwing legal weight behind a choreographed show of pressure on the North that included an unusual joint visit to the demilitarized zone by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates. The measures, announced here by Mrs. Clinton after talks with South Korean officials, focus on counterfeiting, money laundering and other dealings that she said the North Korean government used to generate hard currency to pay off cronies and cling to power. While the United States already places heavy sanctions on North Korea, American officials insisted that the new measures would further tighten the financial vise around the secretive and isolated North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, who, according to regional intelligence,is in declining health. The unilateral American action came two months after a South Korean-led investigationfound North Korea responsiblefor the March sinking of theCheonan, a South Korean warship, which killed 46 sailors. The North’s bellicose behavior, analysts say, reflects a deepening power struggle inside the country. But the United States has struggled to build consensus about how harshly to confront the Kim government. While the United Nations Security Council voted tocondemn the sinking of the warship, it did not name North Korea as the culprit because of resistance from China, the North’s neighbor and most important ally. Mrs. Clinton demanded that the North take responsibility for the attack, saying it would continue to be a pariah until it did so. She ruled out any negotiations with the North Korean government until it agreed to relinquish itsnuclear weapons. And she said that the United States would expand and stiffen its sanctions to “target their leadership, target their assets.” “These measures are not directed at the people of North Korea, who have suffered for too long due to the misguided and maligned priorities of their government,” Mrs. Clinton said at a news conference, flanked by Mr. Gates and South Korea’s defense and foreign ministers. “They are directed at the destabilizing, illicit and provocative policies pursued by that government.” Her announcement punctuated a visit rich in symbols of American diplomacy and military might, organized to mark the 60th anniversary of the start of the Korean War. On Tuesday, the United States and South Korea confirmed that they would stagelarge-scale military exercisesin the seas off Japan and the Korean Peninsula, as a show of deterrence against the North. Then, on Wednesday, Mr. Gates and Mrs. Clinton traveled to Panmunjom, in the demilitarized zone, where they clambered up an observation post in a gloomy drizzle to peer into the North. Later, as the pair toured a small building that straddles the military demarcation line between North and South, a North Korean soldier stared at them through a window. Neither acknowledged the soldier. Afterward, the two stood before a phalanx of cameras, under the gaze of guards from the North Korean side, to proclaim solidarity with South Korea. “It is stunning how little has changed up there and yet how much South Korea continues to grow and prosper,” Mr. Gates said, noting that this was his third visit to the demilitarized zone — the first being in the early 1990s when he was director of central intelligence. It was Mrs. Clinton’s first visit. “Although it may be a thin line,”she said, referring to the narrow strip of land separating the two sides, “these two places are worlds apart.” Mrs. Clinton is heading to a regional security meeting in Vietnam on Thursday, where she is likely to face more reluctance to point fingers at North Korea over the Cheonan. On Tuesday, the meeting’s sponsor, theAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations, issued an opening statement that said it “deplored” the sinking but did not name the aggressor. The administration’s show of solidarity with South Korea has complicated ties with China. In addition to its balkiness at the United Nations,Beijing has objected to the joint naval exercises, which have frayed an already tense relationship between the militaries of China and the United States and also prompted a rebuke from North Korea on Thursday. Earlier this year, Beijing brusquelycanceled a planned visitby Mr. Gates. “I remain open to rebuilding and strengthening military-to-military dialogue between the United States and China,” Mr. Gates said. But he added, “We are obviously concerned by some of the things China has said, some of the things China is doing in the military arena; they are worrying.” Administration officials would not give specifics on the planned North Korean sanctions, but said they would mainly build on those already put in place by the Treasury Department or enshrined in the latest Security Council resolution against North Korea. Mrs. Clinton said the United States would designate North Korean companies and individuals involved in weapons proliferation and other illicit activity. As an example, American officials cited trade in counterfeit cigarettes. The sanctions would also focus on liquor, exotic foods and other luxury goods, which the government in Pyongyang uses in a vast system of patronage. And they will take aim at North Korean officials who use diplomatic privilege to cloak their dealings. Mrs. Clinton said she would send her adviser on nonproliferation and arms control, Robert J. Einhorn, in coming days to discuss the sanctions with countries in Asia. Because no legitimate American banks do business with the North, the effectiveness of the measures will depend heavily on persuading banks in other countries to shun North Korea. Given the North’s profound isolation, some analysts question how much more damage sanctions can do. The strategy of aiming sanctions at the country’s elite is similar to the latest United Nations sanctions against Iran. A previous effort to punish politically connected North Koreans, by freezing assets in a Macao-based bank, Banco Delta Asia, where many of them had accounts, was quite successful, analysts said. But the Bush administration later agreed to have the Macao governmentunblock those accountsin an effort to lure North Korea back to negotiations over its nuclear program — a quid pro quo that ultimately led nowhere. The Obama administration insists that it will not cut such deals with the North to restart talks. “They made commitments over the last years to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, which they have reneged on,” Mrs. Clinton said. “They just refuse to actually do it.”

A September meeting of North Korea&#8217;s ruling party is expected to help a son of the ailing North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, consolidate his power as heir.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreasaid Saturday that its ruling Workers’ Party would hold a rare meeting of delegates in September to elect a new party leadership, a move analysts in Seoul said was intended to help a son of the ailing North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, consolidate his power as heir. The gathering will be the most important meeting of the party since it held a convention in 1980 to elect Mr. Kim to its Politburo, an event that signaled his rise to power under his father, Kim Il-sung. Saturday’s announcement, carried by the North’s state-run Korean Central News Agency, said only that the party was convening its representatives “in early September to elect its highest leading body.” South Korean intelligence authorities say they have noticed an increased effort by Mr. Kim, who reportedly suffered a stroke in 2008, to hand over power toKim Jong-un, the youngest of his three known sons. North Korea has been publicizing songs and poems implicitly praising the son, South Korea’s spy chief, Won Sei-hoon, told lawmakers on Thursday. The younger Mr. Kim is also accompanying his father on his “on-site guidance” tours of factories and military units, the South Korean news media quoted Mr. Won as telling the lawmakers in the briefing. North Korea’s economic hardships are deepening, as are its conflicts with the outside world. The North’s propaganda artists have produced 10 million copies of the younger Mr. Kim’s portrait and are waiting for an order to distribute them, said Open Radio for North Korea, a Seoul-based Web site that gathers news from sources inside the North. Every household in North Korea keeps portraits of Mr. Kim and his father, who died in 1994, hanging side by side on a wall. Although South Korean officials have identified Kim Jong-un as the likely successor since last year, most North Koreans and people outside the country know little about him. Only a few photographs that are thought to be of him are available outside North Korea, all reportedly taken when he was a teenager. He is now believed to be either 27 or 28. The impending shuffle in the party leadership follows personnel changes in the military and the powerful National Defense Commission in the past year. The North’s rubber-stamp Parliament met this month to replace several cabinet members and appointed Mr. Kim’s brother-in-law, Jang Song-taek, to the No. 2 post at the defense commission. Mr. Jang is seen as a potential caretaker for Mr. Kim’s son. The officials at the September meeting are likely to bestow key party titles on the son or install people loyal to him in important jobs to help him control the party from behind the scenes, analysts said. “We can expect a big shift” in North Korea, “with Kim Jong-un’s influence gradually eclipsing that of his father among the power elite,” said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior analyst at the Sejong Institute, a South Korean research organization.

North Korea found two American journalists guilty of illegal entry and sentenced them to 12 years of labor, the nation’s official news agency said Monday.

SEOUL, South Korea  —North Koreaon Monday sentenced two American journalists to 12 years of hard labor  in a case widely seen as a test of how far the isolated Communist state was willing to take its confrontational stance toward the United States. The Central Court, the highest court of North Korea, held the trial  of  the two Americans,Laura LingandEuna Lee, from Thursday  to Monday and convicted them of “committing hostilities against the Korean nation and illegal entry,” the North’s official news agency, KCNA, said in a report  monitored in Seoul. Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee have been held  since they were detained by North Korean soldiers patrolling the border between China and North Korea on March 17. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has called the charges “baseless.” The United States government  had demanded that the North  forgo the legal proceedings and release the two women. The sentencing came amid rising tensions between Washington and Pyongyang. Earlier Monday, North Korea threatened to retaliate with “extreme” measures if the United Nations punished it for its  nuclear test last month, and  Washington warned that it might try to put the North  back on its list of states that sponsor terrorism, a designation that could subject the impoverished state to more financial sanctions. “Our response would be to  consider sanctions against us as a declaration of war and answer it with extreme hard-line measures,” the North Korea’s state-run newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, said in a commentary. Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee were on a reporting assignment from Current TV, a San Francisco-based media company co-founded by Al Gore, the former vice president, when they were detained by the soldiers. The reporters were working on a report about North Korean refugees — women and children — who had fled their homeland  in hopes of finding food in China. The circumstances surrounding their capture remain unclear. Analysts said they were  a pawn in a rapidly deteriorating confrontation between the United States and North Korea — a potential bargaining chip for the Pyongyang regime and a handicap for Washington in its efforts to pressure the government  over its recent missile and nuclear tests. The  sentence to North Korea’s infamous prison camps came despite repeated appeals for clemency from the journalists’ families. Defying not only its traditional foes — the United States, Japan and South Korea — but also its longtime ideological allies, China and Russia, North Korea launched an intermediate-range rocket on April 5 and conducted an underground nuclear test on May 25.

Obama needs to recognize that there is no longer any middle way in dealing with Pyongyang&#8217;s nuclear ambitions. The U.S. either has to accept the North as a nuclear power, or get tough.
==::==
2009-06-04T00:00:00Z
==::==
The Obama administration has so far dealt publicly with the North Korean challenge in an understated, almost leisurely, manner. Emphasizing continued reliance on multilateral diplomacy, it has invited Pyongyang to return to the conference table, even while North Korea threatens military action and tests nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them  —     in the face of a declaration by all the major world powers that such actions are “unacceptable.” The challenge goes far beyond the regional security issue. For America, it involves relations with an emerging superpower (China); relations with a re-emerging Russia; relations with key U.S. allies (Japan and South Korea); and a major escalation in the threat of proliferation to non-state parties. The resumption of nuclear and missile testing by North Korea represents an abrupt reversal of a negotiating process that has been going, with only brief interruptions, for nearly two decades. Since 2004, six-party talks in Beijing included all the countries (North and South Korea, China, Russia, Japan and the United States) directly threatened by North Korean missiles and nuclear weapons. For a while, it was argued that bilateral negotiations between the United States and North Korea would prove more effective. That debate has become largely academic. Both approaches were pursued; both contributed to the stalemate inherited by the Obama administration. I favored negotiations with Pyongyang and have occasionally participated in Track II dialogue with Korean officials outside formal channels. But with North Korea kicking over all previous agreements repeatedly,  process has overwhelmed substance. The ultimate test of the Korean diplomacy always had to be the elimination of North Korea’s stockpile of fissionable material and nuclear weapons. But those were growing while the negotiations were proceeding at their stately pace. The negotiating process thereby ran the risk of legitimizing North Korea’s nuclear program by enabling Pyongyang to establish a fait accompli by means of diplomacy. That point is fast approaching if it has not already been reached. The incoming Obama administration gave North Korea every opportunity to accelerate the negotiating process. While on a visit to Beijing, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton hinted that she was seriously considering a visit to Pyongyang. Stephen Bosworth, a distinguished scholar and moderate diplomat, was appointed principal negotiator. These overtures were vituperatively rejected. Pyongyang used the change of American administration to signal a major shift in course. Bosworth was rebuffed while on a visit to the region. Refusing to return to the negotiating table, Pyongyang  also revoked all the concessions it had previously made. It has restarted its nuclear reprocessing plant and conducted another nuclear weapons test. Many explanations have been advanced for the brazenness of North Korean tactics, such as a domestic struggle for succession to the clearly ailing “Dear Leader” Kim Jong-il. But the only partially rational explanation is that North Korea’s leaders have recognized that no matter how conciliatory United States diplomacy, it would in the next phase demand the destruction of North Korea’s existing weapons capability. Pyongyang’s leaders have obviously decided to reject this outcome in the most absolute and confrontational manner. They must have concluded that no degree of political recognition could compensate for abandoning the signal (and probably sole) achievement of their rule, for which they have obliged their population to accept a form of oppression and exploitation unprecedented even in this period of totalitarianism.  They may well calculate that weathering a period of protest is their ticket to emerging as a de facto nuclear power. Hence the issue is no longer what forum should be used for negotiations but what their purpose is to be. The minimum precondition for a resumption of either of the existing forums would be that Pyongyang restore the previously implemented agreements that it has recently abrogated  —   especially the mothballing of the plutonium separation plant.  But that is not enough. However the next diplomatic phase is conducted, the United States needs to enter it with the recognition that there is no longer any middle ground between the abandonment of the North Korean program and the status quo. Any policy that does not do away with North Korea’s nuclear military capability, in effect, acquiesces in its continuation. A program of marginal additional sanctions followed by another protracted period of give-and-take would have that practical consequence. The North Korean challenge thus confronts the administration with two basic options: To accept tacitly or openly that the North Korean nuclear program is beyond the point where it can be reversed and to seek to cap it and proscribe any proliferating activities beyond North Korea’s borders; To attempt to end the North Korean nuclear program by a maximum deployment of pressures, which requires the active participation of Korea’s neighbors, especially China. Acceptance of the North Korean nuclear program would fly in the face of American foreign policy since we shepherded the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty through the international community in 1967, as well as of the policy put forward by President Obama only two months ago in a seminal speech in Prague. Acquiescence in a North Korean nuclear program would undermine prospects of the proposed negotiations with Iran. If the North Korean methods practiced during the Korean negotiations become a model for negotiations on Mideast nuclear programs, a chaotic world will beckon. De facto acquiescence in a North Korean nuclear program would require a reconsideration of current U.S. strategic planning. More emphasis would need to be given to missile defense. It would be essential to redesign the American deterrent strategy in a world of multiple nuclear powers  —   a challenge unprecedented in our experience. The enhanced role of non-state actors with respect to terrorism would have to be addressed. A new argument in favor of acquiescence in North Korea’s nuclear program has recently made its appearance. It contends that Pyongyang’s conduct is really a hidden cry for assistance against Chinese domination and thus deserves support rather than opprobrium.  But turning North Korea into a ward of the United States is neither feasible nor acceptable to the countries whose support for a solution of the North Korean nuclear issue is imperative. No long-term solution of the Korean nuclear problem is sustainable without the key players of Northeast Asia, and that means China, South Korea, the United States and Japan, with an important role for Russia as well. A wise diplomacy will move urgently to assemble the incentives and pressures to bring about the elimination of nuclear weapons and stockpiles from North Korea. It is not enough to demand unstated pressures from other affected countries, especially China. A concept for the political evolution of Northeast Asia is urgently needed. Too much of the commentary on the current crisis has concerned the deus ex machina of Chinese pressures on North Korea and complaints that Beijing has not implemented its full arsenal of possibilities. But for China, the issue is not so much a negotiating position as concern about its consequences. If the Pyongyang regime is destabilized, the future of Northeast Asia would then have to be settled by deeply concerned parties amidst a fast-moving crisis. They need to know the American attitude and clarify their own for that contingency. China faces challenges perhaps even more complex than America’s. If present trends continue, and if North Korea manages to maintain its nuclear capability through the inability of the parties to bring matters to a head, the proliferation of nuclear weapons throughout Northeast Asia and the Middle East becomes probable. China will then face the prospect of nuclear weapons in all surrounding Asian states and an unmanageable nuclear-armed regime in Pyongyang. But if China exercises the full panoply of its pressures without an accord with America and an understanding with the other parties, it has reason to fear chaos along its borders at or close to the traditional invasion routes of China. A sensitive, thoughtful dialogue with China, rather than peremptory demands, is essential. The outcome of such a dialogue is difficult to predict, but it cannot be managed unless America clarifies its own purposes to itself. Some public statements imply the U.S. will try to deal with specific North Korean threats rather than eliminate the capability to carry them out. They leave open with what determination Washington will pursue the elimination of the existing stockpile of North Korean nuclear weapons and fissionable materials. It is not possible to undertake both courses simultaneously. The ultimate issue is not regional but concerns the prospects for world order, especially for a Pacific political structure along the lines of that put forward by the thoughtful Australian prime minister, Kevin Rudd. There could scarcely seem to be an issue more suited to cooperation among the Great Powers than non-proliferation, especially with regard to North Korea, a regime run by fanatics, located on the borders of China, Russia and South Korea, and within missile range of Japan. Still, the major countries have been unable to galvanize themselves into action. In this multipolar world, many issues like nuclear proliferation, energy and climate change require a concert approach. The major powers of the 21st century have proved to be heterogeneous and without much experience as part of a concert of powers.  Connecting their purposes, however, needs to be their ultimate task if the world is to avoid the catastrophe of unchecked proliferation.

The U.S. defense secretary raised the idea of a tougher approach toward North Korea in meetings with Asian allies at the annual security conference in Singapore, officials said.

SINGAPORE — Defense SecretaryRobert M. Gatesraised the idea of a tougher approach towardNorth Korea’s recent nuclear test in meetings here with Asian allies on Saturday, including the prospect of building up United States military forces in the region should six-nation diplomatic talks with North Korea fail, American defense officials said. Mr. Gates raised “the notion that we should think about this as we are pursuing the six-party talks,” said a senior defense official who asked for anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue. “We ought to think about what more we need to do should they not prove successful.” But another defense official cautioned that talk of any military buildup was premature and that it was merely a “prudent option” in terms of “what should we be thinking about in the event that we need to start enhancing our posture, our defenses?” On Friday Mr. Gates said that the United States had no plans to reinforce some 28,000 American troops based in South Korea. Mr. Gates, who warned North Korea in a speech here early Saturday that the United States would not tolerate it becoming a nuclear-armed nation, met throughout the day at the conference, called the Shangri-La Dialogue, with defense officials from China, South Korea, Japan and other Asian nations to begin pulling together a consensus on how to proceed. James B. Steinberg, the deputy secretary of State, attended a number of meetings, as did Dennis C. Blair, the director of national intelligence. There was widespread acknowledgement that sanctions against North Korea had to be strengthened because of its nuclear test on Monday and subsequent firings of short-range missiles. There was also general agreement that the long-running six-nation talks aimed at getting North Korea to give up its nuclear program had so far failed. But by Sunday morning, Asian defense officials had not endorsed a specific course of action. “There’s no prescription yet on what to do,” said one of the senior American defense officials. Late in the day on Saturday, Mr. Gates had a meeting focused on North Korea with the defense ministers of South Korea and Japan, a precursor to more detailed discussions to occur next week about North Korea’s nuclear test. Mr. Steinberg is to lead the American team at those meetings; the group will include Stuart Levey, the Treasury under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, an indication that economic measures will be a significant part of the discussions. Mr. Gates met on Saturday with the highest-ranking Chinese official at the conference, Lt. Gen. Ma Xiaotian, the deputy chief of the general staff of the People’s Liberation Army. American defense officials said after the meeting that China, which has been reluctant to take tough action against North Korea, clearly viewed the nuclear test seriously.

PARIS — Across the globe from Washington to Moscow to Beijing,North Korea’s underground nuclear test drew condemnation and criticism on Monday and some governments  threatened  to press for tighter sanctions at the United Nations Security Council. But given the patchy record of sanctions on North Korea, it remained unclear what effect such threats might yield. Prime Minister Taro Aso of Japan said his government would seek a new United Nations resolution to condemn the test. He said an urgent meeting of the Security Council was expected to be held on Monday in New York at Japan’s request. China, whose response was closely watched around the world, said it was “resolutely opposed” to the test, according to a  Foreign Ministry  statement carried by the official Xinhua news agency. China is by far North Korea’s largest trading partner and wields critical diplomatic influence. Russia said the test breached a United Nations Security Council resolution and would “endanger security and stability in the region,” according to the Russian Foreign Ministry in a statement. President Obama was among the first to register protest, saying in a statement that “North Korea is directly and recklessly challenging the international community.” The statement continued: “Such provocations will only serve to deepen North Korea’s isolation. It will not find international acceptance unless it abandons its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.” Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he believed the latest series of tests “just speak to the growing belligerence on the part of North Korea,” The Associated Press reported. Appearing on NBC’s “Today” show on Monday, Admiral Mullen said described North Korea as a country that “continues to destabilize that region and in the long term should they continue to develop anuclear weaponsprogram, poses a grave threat to the United States.” European governments joined the call for Security Council action and said North Korea would not gain international acceptance as long as it followed policies that Prime Minister Gordon Brown ofBritaindescribed as “erroneous, misguided and a danger to the world.” The French Foreign Ministry said in a statement: “France will consult in the coming hours with its partners on the Security Council and in the region on the consequences to draw from this serious act by North Korea, and in particular on strengthening sanctions.” Germany also condemned the test. Several European foreign ministers were heading for a meeting in Hanoi with their Asian counterparts when news of the test broke. Carl Bildt, Sweden’s minister of foreign affairs, called the development “alarming.” Javier Solana, the foreign policy chief of the European Union, said in Brussels that the “irresponsible acts by North Korea warrant a firm response.” After the North’s first nuclear test in October 2006, a United Nations Security Council resolution, drafted by the United States, banned trade with North Korea in materials linked with unconventional weapons, and authorized countries to inspect cargo going into and out of the North. It also sought to outlaw international travel and freeze the overseas assets of people associated with the North’s weapons programs. But doubts about the sanctions arose when South Korea and China indicated that business and economic relations would be largely unaffected. In April 2009, North Korea defied the United States, China and a series of United Nations resolutions by launching a rocket that the country said was designed to propel a satellite into space. Much of the world viewed the test as an effort to prove it is edging toward the capability to shoot a nuclear warhead on a longer-range missile. Following the launch, the Security Council decided unanimously last month to tighten sanctions against North Korea. The White House asked the United Nations sanctions committee to develop a list of North Korean companies to be singled out, focusing on companies involved in missile and nuclear technology. But some analysts said they doubted that these measures would prove effective. They noted that China opposed a stronger United Nations response to the April missile launching. On the Korean peninsula on Monday , news of the test caused an initial drop on South Korean markets, where the benchmark Kospi index plummeted by up to 6.3 per cent before recovering almost all of its losses. The won fell against the dollar but also recovered. The government in Seoul called the North Korean underground test a “direct threat against the peace and stability in the region as well as to the world.” Australia offered “absolute condemnation” and New Zealand expressed worries about the test, as did India. “India is against nuclear proliferation,” India’s Defense Minister A.K. Antony said in New Delhi, The A.P. reported. “It’s a matter of very serious concern not only to India, but to the world.”

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreahas told international aviation and maritime authorities that it will launch a satellite in early April,  the North’s official news agency  and a news agency in  the  South reported  on Thursday. North Korea’s neighbors and Western nations believe the launching is actually cover for testing a long-range missile  capable of reaching the American mainland. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has  said such a  launching would be “very unhelpful.” The North’s state-run Korea Central News Agency said the country notified the international organizations to “ensure the safety of flights and sea vessels.” It did not disclose a date. But  South Korea’s  Yonhap news agency, quoting unidentified  government sources, said the North had told the international organizations that the launching would be between April 4 and 8.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreahas been moving what appear to be components of a long-range missile to a launching site, a South Korean official and news reports said Tuesday, raising fears that it might test-fire a missile. The North Korean move, first reported by the South Korean news agency Yonhap and the Japanese newspaper Sankei Shimbun, came amid concern among political analysts in Seoul, South Korea’s capital, that the North might also try some sort of military provocation to help make its nuclear program a foreign policy priority for the Obama administration. North Korea has launched missiles in the past to win political or economic concessions. In recent weeks, it has said that its military had assumed an “all-out confrontational posture” and that it had scrapped all nonaggression pacts with South Korea. In Washington, a State Department spokesman, Robert A. Wood, said he could not comment on the reports, calling them “an intelligence matter.” But he added: “North Korea’s missile activities and missile programs are of concern to the region. A ballistic missile launch by North Korea would be unhelpful and, frankly, provocative.” Recent spy satellite images showed a train carrying a long, cylindrical object, believed to be a missile, heading to a new launching site on North Korea’s western coast, Yonhap reported, quoting an unidentified government official. But in another dispatch late Tuesday, Yonhap said that intelligence officials were still tracking the train and that there was a possibility that the North would take it to another launching site. A South Korean government official reached Tuesday confirmed the train’s movement, as cited by Yonhap. “We detected such a movement in the last week of January,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue with reporters. The object is believed to be a Taepodong-2 missile, Yonhap said. The missile is designed to fly at least 4,200 miles, far enough to reach North America, and carry a payload of 1,400 to 2,200 pounds, according to the South Korean Defense Ministry. North Korea test-fired the missile in July 2006. But it was considered a failure, with its rocket fizzling out shortly after it blasted off. While not ruling out the possibility of a missile test, analysts and officials in Seoul  said that the North often “puts on a show” at its military facilities to stir up uncertainty among its neighbors.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge has awarded more than $65 million to several men of the Navy spy ship Pueblo, who were captured and tortured byNorth Koreain 1968. The judge, Henry H. Kennedy Jr. of Federal District Court, issued the judgment against North Korea on Tuesday. North Korea did not respond to the lawsuit, which accused it of kidnapping, imprisonment and torture. Four former crewmen of the Pueblo filed the suit in 2006. The Pueblo was seized off North Korea on Jan. 23, 1968, while it was on an intelligence-gathering mission. North Korea says the ship was inside its coastal zone. Navy records say it was in international waters. One crew member was killed in the attack, and 10 were wounded. The crewmen were held captive for 11 months.

North Korea on Sunday welcomed the move and said that it would resume disabling its nuclear weapons facilities.

WASHINGTON — The Bush administration announced Saturday that it had removedNorth Koreafrom a list of state sponsors of terrorism in a bid to salvage a fragile nuclear deal that seemed on the verge of collapse. Sean McCormack, the State Department spokesman, said that the United States made the decision after North Korea agreed to resume disabling a plutonium plant and to allow some inspections to verify that it had halted its nuclear program as promised months earlier. The deal, which the Bush administration had portrayed as a major foreign policy achievement, began slipping away in recent weeks in a dispute over the verification program. Just days ago, North Korea barred international inspectors from the plant. The decision to remove North Korea from the terror list was a dramatic moment for President Bush, who had called the country part of an “axis of evil” and had only reluctantly ordered administration officials to engage in negotiations, saying that the United States had made deals with the nation’s leaders before without winning enough concessions. That calculus changed in 2006, when North Korea exploded a nuclear device. But Mr. Bush is already having trouble selling the new agreement to his own party. Republican lawmakers, including the presidential nominee, Senator John McCain, quickly expressed concern, complaining that North Korea had yet to demonstrate that it was serious about adhering to its commitment to denuclearize. Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee for president, called the deal “a modest step forward” in dismantlingNorth Korea’s nuclear weaponsprogram. Other Democrats said they welcomed the agreement but noted that it did not go much beyond an agreement President Clinton reached with North Korea in 1994, which the Bush administration, including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, criticized as inadequate. Bush administration officials, trying to head off potential criticism that they were simply seeking a foreign policy victory in their last months, said the agreement was the best the United States could get at this time. Ms. Rice “very strongly feels that it is our own responsibility, until Jan. 20, 2009, to act as good stewards of the national interest,” Mr. McCormack said during a news conference. In the most significant part of the accord announced Saturday, North Korea agreed to a verification plan that would allow United States inspectors access to its main declared nuclear compound, at Yongbyon; international inspectors have worked at the site on and off for years. But the deal puts off decisions on the thorniest verification issue: what would happen if international experts suspected the North was hiding other nuclear weapons facilities, particularly those related to uranium enrichment. The United States wanted the North to agree to inspections at sites that raised suspicions, but North Korea balked. The new agreement calls for United States inspectors to be granted access to such sites “based on mutual consent” with North Korea. Experts on North Korea say that the concession by the United States was probably necessary to achieve a deal, but that it no doubt will lead to future fights, since the North’s leaders will not want to give inspectors free rein to travel the country. Patricia A. McNerney, one of the State Department negotiators, acknowledged that issue would probably lead to a hornets’ nest of problems. “Going into verification with North Korea will not be easy, we know that,” she said. “This is the most secret and opaque regime in the world.” North Korea on Sunday welcomed its removal from Washington's terrorism blacklist and said that it would resume disabling its nuclear weapons facilities, allowing American and United Nations monitors back into its main nuclear complex. South Korea and Japan also hailed the agreement on Sunday. But hawkish politicians in Washington's two main Asian allies, as well as relatives of people allegedly kidnapped by the Communist state, accused the United States of giving in to the North's bad behavior. "We are extremely disappointed with the United States, which we had believed would be a pillar of anti-terrorism and human rights," said Choi Sung Yong, 56, head of the Abductees' Family Union, which includes relatives of hundreds of South Koreans, mostly fishermen, allegedly abducted to the North. Relatives of the South Korean and Japanese abductees have counted on Bush to use the terrorism blacklist as leverage to pressure the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, to return their missing family members. North Korea, which has long sought international acceptance, had been pushing hard to get off the terror list. But Mr. McCormack made clear on Saturday that North Korea is still subject to numerous economic sanctions. The agreement follows weeks of intense negotiations and high-stakes brinkmanship, as North Korea, furious that the Bush administration had not removed it from the terrorism list as it agreed last summer, threatened to restart its plutonium-based weapons program and barred international inspectors from the Yongbyon plant. In Washington, State Department proponents of the deal, including Ms. Rice and her top North Korea envoy, Christopher R. Hill, battled critics inside and outside the administration who castigated them for trying to salvage the accord. The administration has been at war with itself over whether to go ahead with the North Korea pact despite objections from critics in the office of Vice President Dick Cheney, and even some members of the State Department’s verification and compliance office. That rift spilled into the open at the news conference on Saturday, when a reporter asked Paula A. DeSutter, the assistant secretary of state for verification, compliance and implementation, how she responded to criticism of the deal from John R. Bolton, her former boss at the State Department. Ms. DeSutter did not defend the accord, saying simply, “John is the epitome of a skeptical policymaker, and that’s appropriate.” Despite the internal fights, Ms. Rice convinced President Bush last week that this was the best the administration could get in its remaining time in office. But as late as Friday, things remained up in the air, said one administration official, who, like several other officials and diplomats interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the issue. Another senior administration official described the internal deliberations as a “close call.” Senator McCain said in a statement that he would not support the deal until he got some questions answered. “I expect the administration to explain exactly how this new verification agreement advances American interests and those of our allies,” he said. He added that he was “concerned that this latest agreement appears to have been reached between Washington and Pyongyang, and only then discussed with our Asian allies in an effort to garner their support.” Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Republican of Florida, issued a statement strongly criticizing the deal. “I am profoundly disappointed,” she said. “By rewarding North Korea before the regime has carried out its commitments, we are encouraging this regime to continue its illicit nuclear program and violate its pledge to no longer provide nuclear assistance to extremist regimes.” Two of the Bush administration’s main criticisms of the 1994 accord were that it did not mandate the removal of nuclear material from North Korea and that international inspectors were limited to  Yongbyon. The 1994 accord collapsed in 2002 after the Bush administration accused North Korea of circumventing the agreement by pursuing a second path to a bomb, based on enriching uranium. The White House said at the time that it would require full verification that any uranium program had been halted, though later the intelligence community expressed some doubts about how far the program had gotten. Although the new agreement leaves open the possibility of future inspections outside Yongbyon, it leaves vague what mechanism would be used to determine the status of a uranium program. The North has agreed in principle to give up its nuclear material and any weapons, but that seems almost certain to be subject to negotiations with the next president. During the Bush administration, North Korea is believed to have produced enough bomb-grade plutonium for six or more nuclear weapons. Bush administration officials have been consulting about the latest deal with its partners in the so-called “six-party” talks, the group including Russia, South Korea and Japan that negotiated the agreement in 2007 for the North to halt its nuclear activities. Diplomats said that Japan had expressed reservations about removing North Korea from the terror list because the North still had not addressed all of their concerns about abductions of Japanese citizens decades ago. After the official announcement on Saturday, Japan’s finance minister, Shoichi Nakagawa, called the American decision “extremely regrettable.” South Korea has been more supportive. “We welcome the agreement because we believe this will help put the six-party negotiations back on track and eventually lead to the dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear programs,” said Kim Sook, South Korea’s main nuclear envoy, during a news conference in Seoul on Sunday. The South Korean foreign minister, Yu Myung-hwan, had stressed Friday that if the six-party negotiations fell apart now, the next administration would have difficulty restarting them. Gary Samore, a nonproliferation expert in the Clinton administration, characterized the deal as probably the best that could be gotten at this time, but warned of stormy times to come. “Every agreement you ever have with the North Koreans always contains certain ambiguities, and that ends up being the basis for which you have the next round of talks,” he said. “It’s always two steps forward and one step back.” For instance, he said, besides the issue of access to suspected nuclear sites, the United States and North Korea appear to have fudged the critical issue of whether American inspectors will be allowed to take all the samples they want out of the country to foreign laboratories for inspection. According to a fact sheet issued by the Bush administration, the two sides agreed “on the use of scientific procedures, including sampling and forensic activities,” although the sheet doesn’t say where those tests would be done. Mr. Bolton, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations under Mr. Bush, said that the Bush administration had “punted” the hardest issue, that of inspections beyond declared nuclear sites. “This means that North Korea has a veto over everything beyond Yongbyon,” he said, “so that’s a clear victory for North Korea.”

The Bush administration is dispatching Christopher Hill to Pyongyang in a last-ditch effort to rescue an accord leading to the country’s nuclear disarmament.

WASHINGTON  — The Bush administration is dispatching its chiefNorth Koreanegotiator, Christopher Hill, to Pyongyang this week in a last-ditch effort to rescue what the White House had hoped would be a singular foreign policy achievement: an accord leading to the country’s nuclear disarmament. The rapid decision to send Mr. Hill to the North Korean capital, days after North Korea broke the seals thatUnited Nationsinspectors placed on its equipment and said it was restarting a facility to manufacture bomb-grade plutonium, seemed to underscore the administration’s desperation to restore an accord that took most of President Bush’s second term to negotiate and implement. Mr. Hill, one administration official said, is “flying blind,” hoping to get a previous agreement back on track. The fact that Mr. Hill is going to Pyongyang at all shows how much has changed in the administration. In his first term. Mr. Bush refused to talk to the country, and American strategy was to hasten North Korea’s economic collapse. But the country refused to buckle, and sped ahead with its nuclear enrichment facility. In more recent years, the administration argued for months about whether to allow Mr. Hill to participate in direct talks with the North Koreans, particularly in Pyongyang. His efforts to go there were repeatedly blocked by hard-liners who argued that to show up in North Korea would be to reward the government there. But if there were any such arguments this time, they appear to have been brief. The United States must decide in the next month or two whether to continue sending oil shipments to North Korea; before it cuts them off, officials say, Mr. Hill wanted to make a direct appeal to the North Korean leadership. But it is not clear who is controlling the country, after reports PresidentKim Jong-ilsuffered a stroke.

To the Editor: Re “North Koreans Welcome Symphonic Diplomacy” (news article, Feb. 27): Much as I welcome the New York Philharmonic’s role in peacemaking, if a family memory serves as precedent, it may be some time before the orchestra’s visit to North Korea has any positive effect. In 1956, my father, Leonard Burkat, who was at that time the music administrator of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, traveled with the orchestra to the Soviet Union, where it played before the country’s leaders and on radio and television. The tour was underwritten in part by the United States State Department and was said to be the first visit by an American orchestra to the Soviet Union after World War II. Its goal was clear: to help that country and the United States break down the large barriers that separated them. Unfortunately, it took 35 more years and the end of Communist rule to really make that happen. Howard BurkatHastings-on-Hudson, Feb. 27, 2008  To the Editor: The White House dismissed the significance of the New York Philharmonic’s concert in Pyongyang as neither hurting nor helping our diplomatic efforts in North Korea. The emotional outpouring of appreciation by people weaned on anti-Americanism for decades points in a different direction. The concert was not the “axis of evil” threat of a bully, but the face and voice of the American people. If a concert in Pyongyang, why not in Tehran? Why not in Havana? The objection that such events tend to legitimize the host government is absurd. Donald E. SmithWayne, Pa., Feb. 27, 2008  To the Editor: As a native New Yorker, I find it embarrassing to see one of the city’s most prestigious institutions act so naïvely and without regard to the millions who have been abused, jailed, tortured and executed by the dictatorships of Kim Jong-il and his father, Kim Il-sung. Aren’t we New Yorkers supposed to be a street-smart bunch, progressive and concerned with those less fortunate around the world? Instead, the members of the New York Philharmonic played for well-off party dignitaries, while the real North Korean population is starving and living in sections of the Korean Peninsula that many foreign observers have described as almost prison camps. During the 1980s, many artists and performers rightly refused to interact with apartheid South Africa. It’s hypocritical to now see no problem with a cultural exchange with one of the most repressive dictatorships in the world. Mario RamirezWantagh, N.Y., Feb. 27, 2008

The president wrote a letter to Kim Jong-il, his first direct communication with the reclusive North Korean dictator. 
==::==
2007-12-07T00:00:00Z
==::==
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 — President Bush, directly engaging the man he publicly called a “tyrant,” wrote a letter toNorth Korea’s leader,Kim Jong-il, in which he held out the prospect of normalized relations with the United States if North Korea fully disclosed its nuclear programs and dismantled its nuclear reactor, administration officials said Thursday. The high-level personal missive from Mr. Bush to the leader of the country he placed in his “axis of evil” in 2002 was sent as American negotiators  struggle to get the secretive North Korean government to fully explain and disclose the extent, use and spread of its nuclear material and technology. At the same time, the United States is also urging other nations to maintain pressure on Iran in the wake of a new assessment that Tehran halted nuclear weapons work in 2003. Mr. Bush addressed the letter  “Dear Mr. Chairman,” and urged the enigmatic North Korean leader to disclose all of his country’s past and present nuclear work. “I want to emphasize that the declaration must be complete and accurate if we are to continue our progress,” the letter said, according to a senior administration official. The letter closed, “Sincerely,George W. Bush.” It was signed by hand, administration officials said. While administration officials described the letter as straightforward, its very existence underscores just how much the White House wants to ensure that one of the administration’s scarce, tangible diplomatic accomplishments does not slip away. North Korea agreed in October to dismantle all of its nuclear facilities and to disclose all of its past and present nuclear programs by the end of the year in return for about a million tons  of fuel oil or its equivalent in economic aid. That agreement has come under fierce criticism from national security hawks, but many foreign policy experts point to it as a rare diplomatic success in a period that has been dominated by frustration in Iran, the Middle East and Pakistan. The White House declined to provide copies of the letter and sought to minimize its significance by pointing out that Mr. Bush had written letters to the leaders of all the other countries in the so-called six-party group that had been working to end North Korea’s nuclear program. “In these letters, the president reiterated our commitment to the six-party talks and stressed the need for North Korea to come forward with a full and complete declaration of their nuclear programs, as called for in the September 2005 six-party agreement,” said Gordon D. Johndroe, a White House spokesman. But Mr. Bush talks to the leaders of the other countries — China, Russia, Japan and South Korea — on a regular basis. And the letters were not identical, administration officials said. “The letter to Kim Jong-il speaks of the six-party process and its historical mission, and lays out a vision of normalization and complete denuclearization,” a senior administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment on the letters publicly. “They are all different.” Another administration official said the letter emphasized the need to resolve three sticking points: the number of warheads North Korea built, the amount of weapons-grade nuclear material it produced and the need for North Korea to disclose what nuclear material and knowledge it has received from other countries and what nuclear material and knowledge it has passed on to other countries. The proliferation issue has taken on new importance since an Israeli strike in Syria in September, which administration and Israeli officials say was conducted against a nuclear plant near the Euphrates River that was supplied with material from North Korea. Administration officials want North Korea to disclose what help it may have given Syria, although they also acknowledge that any such assistance occurred before North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear reactor and disclose its nuclear programs. Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice indicated on Thursday that Dec. 31 was not a hard and fast deadline for the disclosure, and that it could slip a few days or even weeks. The letter to Mr. Kim is dated Dec. 1, administration officials said. Mr. Hill delivered it to his North Korean counterpart in Beijing on Wednesday. Within hours, North Korea announced that Mr. Kim had received the letter. The White House letter is a huge reversal from the veritable cold war that has existed between Mr. Bush and Mr. Kim for most of the Bush administration. In 2002, Mr. Bush referred to Mr. Kim as a “pygmy” and compared him to a “spoiled child at a dinner table” during a meeting with Republican senators, according to news reports at the time. In his State of the Union address that same year, Mr. Bush called Mr. Kim’s government “a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction, while starving its citizens.” During a news conference in 2005, Mr. Bush called Mr. Kim a “tyrant” and said he maintained “concentration camps.” The letter struck a more cordial tone. “I would describe it as a presidential letter to another leader of a country,” said Dana Perino, the White House press secretary. Mr. Hill, who was recently in North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang, and was in Beijing on Wednesday for meetings with some of his counterparts in the talks, has advised the North to make a full disclosure of its nuclear programs, as it agreed to in October. North Korea seemed to be on the verge of making a limited disclosure, perhaps as a negotiating ploy before Dec. 31, the tentative deadline, administration officials said. Administration officials are walking something of a tightrope between pressing hard for the declaration and compromising with North Korean negotiators to get one and declare victory. Several senior officials said they were mindful of criticism from national security hawks in Washington, who do not want to see a deal go through because they do not believe that North Korea will abide by it. “This is like Lucy and Charlie Brown and the football,” said John R. Bolton, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations. “How many times are we going to go through this with them?”

The deputy chief of the U.N. Development Program said the American accusations far surpassed what the program had at its disposal.

==::==
UNITED NATIONS, June 28 — The deputy chief of the United Nations Development Program has shot back at American accusations that it had squandered millions of dollars inNorth Korea, saying the amount far surpassed what the program had at its disposal and questioning the authenticity of documents the American mission provided to back up its claims. In a confidential letter delivered Thursday evening to Zalmay Khalilzad, the United States ambassador, the official, Ad Melkert, said the money amounts, vendor names and transaction dates supplied by the United States had been examined against his agency’s records and “there is not a single match.” He said the volume of payments that the Americans claimed that the program had made to North Korean government entities was “significantly higher” than the total that the office had for all purposes in the country. American officials have said their charges stem from internal business records of the program, but Mr. Melkert challenged the veracity of seven supporting documents that the United States mission supplied in a June 15 meeting. Those were presented as being files from 2001 and 2002, but he said his office had determined that they had been generated under a computer coding system put into effect in 2004. The documents, he said, “show U.N.D.P. corporate system codes not in use by U.N.D.P. in those years.” Noting that the United States had termed the evidence made available so far “sample documents,” Mr. Melkert asked Mr. Khalilzad to furnish all of the documentation substantiating the American claims. The letter is the latest in a series of frosty exchanges between Mr. Melkert and American officials in the six months since Mark D. Wallace, the deputy American ambassador for management, accused the program of serving as “a steady and large source of hard currency” for the North Korean government. The program, Mr. Wallace wrote then, has been “systematically perverted for the benefit of the Kim Jong-il regime rather than the people of North Korea,” and he suggested that the United Nations money might have ended up financing North Korea’s nuclear program. The new letter was made available by an official interested in combating the wide attention that the American allegations had received through briefings by Mr. Wallace for selected news outlets, editorial writers, members of Congress and nations that finance the development program. A note sent to participants in a briefing by Mr. Wallace before a subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on May 23 promised “many parallels to the oil-for-food scandal” and evidence of “a direct link between U.N. assistance and the North Korean missile programs.” Mr. Melkert complained in a previous letter that the briefings failed to mention the rebuttals supplied by his office to each set of allegations. Asked Thursday afternoon about the months of charge and countercharge, Mr. Wallace noted that Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and Kemal Dervis, the development program’s chief, had committed themselves to look into the matter. “I think the U.S. certainly looks forward to the U.N.D.P.’s constructive and technical inquiry into the program, a program that appears to have lost its way,” he said. The original January accusation from Mr. Wallace prompted the development program’s executive board that same month to order an end to the practice of furnishing payments in hard currency to the North Korean government and to making in-country hiring subject to government approval. In March, after North Korea resisted those conditions, the agency announced that it was suspending operations in the country, curtailing 20 programs with an overall budget of $4.4 million. The programs dealt with agricultural recovery and rural energy development, according to the development program’s Web site. On June 1 a preliminary United Nations audit offered no support for the charge that systematic large-scale diversions to the North Korean government had occurred, but it said the program had broken its own rules by hiring workers selected by the government and paying them in foreign currency. Then the United States raised a series of new charges, and program officials responded to each point. To Mr. Wallace’s charge that the program had transferred $7 million to its counterpart agency in the North Korean government, the program said that the amount actually had been $175,000 and that most of it had gone for  workshops on vegetable growing and seed processing. The program reiterated the same $175,000 figure in reply to a second allegation: that an additional $2.8 million in program money had gone to North Korean missions in New York and Europe and had been used to purchase buildings and houses in Britain, France and Canada. The agency also turned aside Mr. Wallace’s accusations that it had procured equipment for North Korea that could be put to military use. It said the equipment, which included global positioning systems, personal computers and a portable spectrometer, an optical device, had been purchased under a program, common in developing nations, that monitors natural disasters and helps to estimate crop yields. Mr. Melkert also denied that his agency had paid $2.7 million to the Zang Lok Trading Company, a banking institution based in Macao that Mr. Wallace said was linked to a North Korean financial agent involved in weapons sales. According to banking records, Mr. Melkert said, the development program’s total payments to Zang Lok from 1999 to the present amount to $52,201.95 and went for workshop equipment and computers for Unesco, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and for the World Intellectual Property Organization. The development program had no transactions with Zang Lok on its own account, he said. Totaling up the charges, Mr. Melkert said in his letter to Mr. Khalilzad that “the allegation that U.N.D.P. transferred $15 million in cash to the D.P.R.K. government in the period 2001-2005  is not supported as our banking records show that the country office did not have this magnitude of resources at its disposal.” North Korea’s official name is the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Mr. Melkert said that only an average of $2.5 million a year had been available from 2001 to 2005 and that the sum included all payments made by the country office supporting development program operations and some other United Nations functions. Mr. Wallace has also cited “eyewitness accounts” from unidentified people to support his charges, and he has accused the program of retaliating against one of its employees for revealing information about mismanagement. In a letter Tuesday to the secretary general, Senator Norm Coleman, a Minnesota Republican, identified the employee as Artjon Shkurtaj, the program’s chief of operations in North Korea in 2005 and 2006. David Morrison, the program’s spokesman, said Mr. Shkurtaj left North Korea in August 2006 and left the program in March 2007, after fulfilling several short-term contracts. Senator Coleman said he had been let go because of concerns he had raised and should be afforded whistle-blower protection. Mr. Melkert said Mr. Shkurtaj had been invited to submit his information to the program’s audit office but had declined to do so.

North Koreahas test-fired “several missiles,” the United States said, as United Nations nuclear inspectors prepared to visit the Yongbyon reactor today, which North Korea has promised to shut down. “The United States is deeply troubled that North Korea has decided to launch these missiles during a delicate time in the six-party talks,” said Gordon D. Johndroe, a spokesman for theNational Security Council. He added that the United States expected North Korea “to refrain from conducting further provocative ballistic missile launches.” But a Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Chito Peppler of the Navy, played down the  launchings and said they were short-range missiles.  “We believe that this was a routine exercise,” he said.

U.S. officials say doubts about the progress of North Korea’s uranium enrichment gives the country a face-saving way to surrender its nuclear equipment.
==::==

==::==
WASHINGTON, March 4  —  In an effort to make the best of newly murky intelligence aboutNorth Korea, Bush administration officials say they plan to tell the North’s   nuclear negotiators on Monday that Washington’s doubts about how much progress the country has made in enriching uranium gives  North Korea   a face-saving way to surrender its nuclear equipment. The new approach to solve a  dispute over the existence and extent of  a uranium program, which intelligence agencies say could have been developed  using  equipment that the North Koreans purchased from Pakistan, will come at a meeting with North Korea at theUnited Nations. It is the first session intended  to hammer out a schedule under which North Korea is supposed to  disable its main nuclear plant and then account for all its nuclear programs. Because the agreement includes providing North Korea with  a million tons of fuel oil  before it turns over  its suspected arsenal of nuclear arms and fuel, some of President Bush’s conservative allies have denounced it as a dangerous concession. Mr. Bush has called it a “first step,” though it bears similarities to the kind of deal that the administration rejected in its first term. On Sunday, Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, said that at the meeting he planned to “form an agenda to work on our bilateral relationship —  what’s involved in the establishment of diplomatic relations, what’s involved before North Korea can get off the state-sponsor-of-terrorism list, and how to get them off the Trading with the Enemies Act.” He said he would  be “pressing for disclosure of all their nuclear programs, including highly enriched uranium.” Persuading North Korea to address  that program will be particularly challenging —  both because the North Koreans have denied seeking to enrich uranium and because a top American intelligence official told Congress last week that there was  only moderate confidence that the equipment  North Korea bought had been used. But that ambiguity, officials say, may give North Korea the chance to turn over its equipment with a vague explanation that an effort to produce energy, rather than a bomb, did not work out. That is a very different tone than intelligence officials struck in November 2002, just after American officials told the North Koreans that they had discovered evidence of the purchase of centrifuges, the high-speed devices that enrich uranium, from Abdul Qadeer Khan, the head of Pakistan’s nuclear program. In an unclassified, single-page report distributed to members of Congress at the time, top agency officials, headed by George J. Tenet, then the director of the Central Intelligence Agency,  reported, “We recently learned that the North is constructing a plant that could produce enough weapons-grade uranium for two or more nuclear weapons per year when fully operational —  which could be as soon as mid-decade.” On Friday, three days after the testimony of Joseph DeTrani, the North Korea coordinator for the director of national intelligence, suggesting doubts about the current state of the program, Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan and the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, sent a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates seeking more answers. “Is this still the intelligence community’s assessment?” he asked of the 2002 report. “If not, why, and when did the intelligence community revise this assessment? What is the current intelligence community assessment?” He also asked what underlay the conclusion that an enrichment plant was under construction.

The negotiations appeared near collapse on Sunday over North Korea’s demands for huge shipments of fuel oil and electricity.

BEIJING, Feb. 11 — Negotiations on a step-by-step deal that the Bush administration hopes will leadNorth Koreato give up its nuclear weapons program appeared near collapse on Sunday over North Korea’s demands for huge shipments of fuel oil and electricity before agreeing to a schedule for turning over its nuclear weapons and fuel. The chief American envoy, Christopher R. Hill, said he and North Korea’s envoy, Kim Kye-gwan, held a “lengthy and very frank” meeting on Sunday. But Mr. Hill seemed much less optimistic that a deal could be struck. Negotiators are planning to end the talks on Monday, and other envoys were pessimistic that any breakthrough would emerge on the final day. Meanwhile, a summary of the proposed agreement being circulated among senior policy makers in Washington makes it clear that even if the North agreed to take the listed first steps — sealing its main nuclear reactor and inviting international inspectors back into the country — there was no specified time period during which it would  be required to turn over any nuclear weapons or weapons fuel that it has produced in recent years.  And such a turnover would happen  only after reaching another agreement. In essence, the agreement Mr. Hill, an assistant secretary of state, is negotiating could prevent the North from producing more weapons, but defers discussions over the weapons and fuel it has stockpiled. Mr. Hill had earlier suggested that if there was agreement, follow-up talks could be set up in March and April. The summary calls for all six nations in the talks — the others are South Korea, Japan, China and Russia — to “create working groups for full and rapid implementation” of a September 2005 agreement in which the North agreed in principle to abandon its nuclear weapons. But in the past, the North Korean envoys to similar working groups have proven to have no real negotiating authority. Furthermore, the proposed agreement sets no dates on nuclear action beyond shutting down the nuclear plant at Yongbyon and allowing inspectors in within 60 days; it leaves unresolved what the North would get in return. The summary was given to The New York Times by a person trying to explain the timing and vagueness of the deal’s elements. After months of preparation that created unusual optimism within the Bush administration, failure to reach even a preliminary agreement could cast doubt on the prospects of disarming North Korea in the administration’s last two years. Several Asian diplomats said  they feared that North Korea had sensed the American distraction in Iraq and could be trying to run out the clock until the election of a new president. At the same time, the North is under pressure because of the effectiveness of financial sanctions, particularly those aimed at Kim Jong-il and other North Korean leaders, and it may feel this is a good time to extract concessions from the South Korean government, which is clinging to economic ties to the North. Mr. Hill, a seasoned negotiator who played a critical role in the Dayton accords that ended conflict in the Balkans in 1995, made it clear that the United States would not sign a deal that provided North Korea with energy but failed to ensure that it gave up its nuclear material. “We’re not looking to provide energy assistance so that they could avoid taking the further steps on denuclearization,” he said at a news conference late Sunday in Beijing. “We understand that you can’t just get there in one jump, you have to take several steps, so we’re prepared to take several steps.” He added, “But we’re not interested in providing that kind of assistance so that they don’t have to take the next step.” In the past, the North has always insisted that it get rewards before giving away the nuclear ability that Mr. Kim regards as his sole international bargaining chip. Kyodo, the Japanese news agency, has reported that North Korea wants an annual energy package of two million tons of fuel oil and two million kilowatts of electricity for taking the first steps in the agreement. It quoted unidentifed diplomatic contacts who said the North also wanted a short-term infusion of hundreds of thousands of tons of fuel oil almost immediately. That presumably would be a reward for shutting down Yongbyon, even though it  does not provide electric energy. Any deal would inevitably be compared with the 1994 agreement between the Clinton administration and North Korea. President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice have  criticized that accord because it involved a “freeze” on activity that the North could quickly reverse, and because it left the shipment of weapons and fuel out of the country to the very end. The agreement fell apart in 2002, and the North is believed to have then converted its spent nuclear fuel into weapons. The North tested its first nuclear device in October, though with only partial success. Outside experts familiar with the outlines of the proposed deal say that the Bush administration would give up relatively little at the beginning,  but it would also receive little. “Freezing and disabling Yongbyon is an important but modest step,” said Michael Green, who negotiated with North Korea as the top Asia expert at the National Security Council until he left a year ago. “It does not yet capture harvested plutonium and the existing weapons.” If a deal holds together, he said, “the key will be retaining leverage” on the North by preventing China, Russia and South Korea from increasing their economic cooperation so much that that their actions negate the United Nations Security Council sanctions on the North. According to the outline, the proposed agreement would establish “tight timelines for actions that are measured in months, not years,” and would include a flurry of moves in the first 60 days, among them the closing of the Yongbyon facilities. Inspectors would return to the country for the first time in more than four years, and the North would have to declare “all of its existing nuclear programs.” That is a reference to the American accusation that the North has a hidden program to enrich uranium, purchased from the rogue Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan. The North once admitted to the existence of the program, American officials say, but has since denied it. The working groups outlined by the proposed agreement would discuss denuclearization, economic and energy cooperation, normalization of diplomatic relations, and a peace treaty formally ending the Korean War. The North’s commitments, the document says, “are to all five other parties, including China,” and it says that “conventional energy assistance will be determined by the working group and will be commensurate with the steps” North Korea takes to fulfill its commitments. The huge annual energy package North Korea is demanding would eclipse the aid provided under the 1994 deal, when the North was promised light-water nuclear reactors with a generating capacity of two million kilowatts of electricity, as well as a temporary fix of 500,000 tons of heavy fuel oil. The chief Japanese envoy, Kenichiro Sasae, told Kyodo, “The problem is that North Korea has excessive expectations about this, and unless it reconsiders this issue, an agreement will be difficult.” North Korea’s insistence on the package deflated the optimism that had infused the early days of this round of talks and spread to senior officials in the White House, who said they expected a deal this weekend. By Sunday afternoon, diplomats had decided that Monday would be the final day of talks, agreement or no. According to Reuters, South Korea’s representative, Chun Yung-woo, blamed the size of the energy package “and the scope, pace and range of the North’s actions to denuclearize” for the stalemate. The Russian envoy, Aleksandr Losyukov, suggested that the best outcome might be a “chairman’s statement” by China that summarized the negotiations. “It seems the chances to reach a joint statement are slim,” Mr. Losyukov said, according to Xinhua, China’s official news agency.

The return of an official who was banished may signal a renewed openness to economic reforms.
==::==

==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — A former North Korean prime minister who was banished three years ago for pushing market-oriented reforms too far has returned to the center of economic policy, leading to speculation that the nation’s leader, Kim Jong-il, might give such proposals a second chance. The former prime minister, Pak Pong-ju, 71, resurfaced at a state function in the capital, Pyongyang, on Saturday, carrying the title of first deputy director of the central committee of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea, according to the North’s state-run Central Broadcasting Station. He is the latest among senior North Korean officials whose sudden banishment and equally unexpected reinstatement have sparked outside speculation about Mr. Kim’s intentions. Mr. Pak appeared to have fallen from Mr. Kim’s favor when he was fired from the premiership in 2007 and sent to work as a factory manager in a provincial town. “His reinstatement could signal the return of pragmatists and reformists,” said Cheong Seong-chang, aNorth Koreaanalyst in the Sejong Institute south of Seoul. “We may be able to see him push the economic reform and openness he had once championed.” Analysts in Seoul say that few North Korean officials wield much individual influence in Mr. Kim’s government. But they say that they can infer Mr. Kim’s plans from the way he punishes and rewards officials identified with various policy approaches. “Pak’s reinstatement indicates that North Korea is shifting back to market reforms, even if grudgingly, after its botched attempt to re-enforce state control on the economy,” said Baek Seung-joo, the head of North Korea research at the government-financed Korea Institute for Defense Analyses in Seoul. Mr. Pak, a lifetime technocrat, was best known as the architect of “Measures to Improve Economic Management Order.” Issued on July 1, 2002, they indirectly acknowledged the failure of the North’s ration system by instructing factories, collective farms and other economic units to provide their own daily necessities and give incentives for workers. In September 2003 Mr. Pak was made prime minister, a post in charge of carrying out economic policies. His reforms were necessitated by the collapse of the centrally planned economy after a famine in the mid-1990s. But they also coincided with — and fueled — the spread of private markets, which quickly emerged as a key source of food and other necessities for North Koreans. But Mr. Pak’s reform programs irked the government’s old guard, especially in the hard-line military, which had grabbed the lion’s share in trade under the old system. The markets facilitated the influx of DVDs and other smuggled goods the government considered a capitalist threat. Around 2005, North Korea began controlling markets. Its attempt to reinforce state control on the economy peaked late last year whenit replaced its banknotes with a new currency, shut down markets and ordered people to buy goods only from state-run stores. The currency reform was aimed at stifling the markets by drastically reducing traders’ personal wealth in the old currency. Themoves quickly backfired. Inflation surged as traders hoarded their goods and government stores failed to meet demand. Sporadic protests were reported. Earlier this year, Pak Nam-gi, head of finance and planning who led the failed currency reform, was executed, according to South Korean news reports. North Korean markets began coming back to life, according to recent defectors. Pak Pong-ju, the former prime minister,  returns as North Korea prepares for a party caucus early next month. Officials and analysts in Seoul say they will monitor the meeting for changes in the cabinet and party leadership that might provide clues to Mr. Kim’s plans to hand over power to his third son,Kim Jong-un, who is in his late 20s. Mr. Pak’s reinstatement adds to the growing influence of Jang Song-taek, Mr. Kim’s brother-in-law, said Mr. Baek, the researcher. In June, Mr. Kim presided over a session of the rubber-stamp Supreme People’s Assembly where Mr. Jang, a potential caretaker for his son, was elevated to the No. 2 post in the ruling hierarchy. In the same meeting, Mr. Pak’s successor as prime minister, Kim Yong-il, who reportedly made a rare apology in February for the botched currency reform, was fired. Mr. Pak, as first deputy director, is believed to report directly to Kim Kyong-hee, Mr. Kim’s younger sister and Mr. Jang’s wife, who works as party director in charge of the North’s light industries, Mr. Cheong said. Mr. Jang, 64, is widely seen as a main player in ensuring the transfer of power to the leader’s son. He may even head a collective caretaker government if Mr. Kim dies before his son is firmly in control  or is seen as too young to lead a ruling hierarchy that includes generals in their 70s and 80s, analysts said.

Amnesty International interviewed 40 North Korean defectors and heard tales of operations without anesthesia and meals of grass and bark.

SEOUL, South Korea — North Korean doctors perform operations withoutanesthesiain clinics wherehypodermic needlesare not sterilized and sheets are not washed, the human rights groupAmnesty Internationalsaid in areportreleased on Thursday. “Five medical assistants held my arms and legs down to keep me from moving,” the report quoted a 24-year-old North Korean defector as saying, describing how his left leg was amputated without anesthesia after a train accident. “I was in so much pain that I screamed and eventually fainted from pain.” Other defectors told similarly horrific stories. One said her appendix was removed without anesthesia and her hands and feet were bound to prevent her from moving during the procedure. Others told of entire cities with no ambulances. Drawn from interviews with more than 40 North Koreans who had defected over the past six years, as well as with health professionals who had worked with North Koreans, the report depicted a North Korean health system in dire straits. Long cut off from most of the world,North Koreahas been pushing its people even deeper into isolation. Rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula after the North’s nuclear test last year and the North’s presumed role in the sinking of a South Korean warship in March have driven away potential aid donors. The government’s botched currency reform late last year also worsened chronic food shortages in the North. “The North Korean people are in critical need of medical andfood aid,” said Catherine Baber, Amnesty International’s deputy director for the Asia-Pacific. “It is crucial that aid to North Korea is not used as a political football by donor countries.” North Korea claims that it offers free medical service for all its people. But in reality, patients have had to pay their doctors with cash, cigarettes, alcohol and food since the 1990s, the 50-page report said. “Many North Koreans bypass doctors altogether, going straight to the markets to buy medicine, self-medicating according to their own guesswork or the advice of market vendors,” it said. “The North Korean authorities recently banned a highly addictive narcotic painkiller that many North Koreans routinely used as a cure-all.” North Korea spends less on health care than any other country in the world — less than $1 per person per year, according to the World Health Organization. As some North Koreans resorted to eating grass, tree bark and roots, tuberculosis has made a comeback in North Korea, Amnesty International said. For years, North Koreans fleeing their country have told of a deteriorating health care system, especially after the collapse of the economy in the mid-1990s.

North Korea said Friday it would release an American who illegally entered the country on Christmas Day to urge its leader, Kim Jong-il, to resign.

SEOUL —North Koreasaid Friday that it would release Robert Park, a Christian missionary from the United States who illegally entered the country on Christmas Day to urge its leader, Kim Jong-il, to shut down its concentration camps, free all its prisoners and resign. North Korean officials said they “decided to leniently forgive and release him, taking his admission and sincere repentance of his wrongdoings into consideration,” according to a report by the North’s official news agency, K.C.N.A. North Korea hadremained silent about the fate of Mr. Park,28, a Korean-American religious activist from Tucson who disappeared into the isolated nation after walking across a frozen river that makes up part of the border with China. Before his trip, he told friends in Seoul that he would die with political prisoners in the North if Mr. Kim refused to free them. But Mr. Park confessed that he had been wrong about the North after meeting kind North Koreans, the K.C.N.A. report said. “I seriously repent of the wrong I committed, taken in by the West’s false propaganda,” it quoted Mr. Park as saying in an interview. “What I have seen and heard in the North convinced me that I misunderstood it.” The agency said Mr. Park gave the interview voluntarily. There was no indication when he might be released. Mr. Park also was quoted as saying that his prejudices about the North were shattered first by North Korean border guards who protected his human rights and later by the “shocking fact” he learned during a visit to Pongsu Church in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, that freedom of religion was fully protected in the North. “They even returned my Bible to me,” he was quoted as saying. “This fact alone was enough to convince me that there was a complete freedom of religion.” Pongsu Church is widely believed to be fake: The North takes outside visitors there to advertise its claim to religious freedom. Jo Sung-rae, the head of Pax Koreana, a conservative civic group in Seoul that supported Mr. Park’s mission to North Korea, said he believed that the American was coerced to make his statement praising the North. He said that he had heard from sources inside the North that Mr. Park had been severely beaten. When he crossed the border into the North, Mr. Park was carrying statements bitterly criticizing Mr. Kim for human rights violations and calling for his resignation, his friends said. Such criticism is a grave crime in North Korea, one that usually entails a lengthy term in a prison camp, if not immediate execution, according to officials and analysts in Seoul. The North had previously freed American citizens under detention, but usually after high-profile foreign envoys visited Pyongyang. The North’s decision to free Mr. Park without demanding such a visit — which could be used for domestic propaganda — comes as it seeks to draw Washington into bilateral talks. There was no immediate comment from the United States government. Washington does not have diplomatic ties with North Korea and has been working through the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang to gain consular access to Mr. Park. Last month, Robert R. King, President Obama’s envoy on North Korean human rights issues, called the North “one of the worst places in terms of lack of human rights.” North Korea keeps an estimated 160,000 political prisoners in labor camps, according to reports from the United States and South Korean governments. It also punished religious activities, they said.

North Korea put further pressure on the U.S. to start bilateral talks by declaring that it had completed reprocessing its spent nuclear fuel for use in a bomb.

==::==
SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreaput further pressure on the United States to start bilateral talks  by declaring on Tuesday that it had completed reprocessing its spent nuclear fuel for use in  a  bomb. In early September, North Korea had told the United Nations Security Council that it was in the “final phase” of reprocessing 8,000 spent fuel rods unloaded from its nuclear reactor in Yongbyon,  north of Pyongyang, and was “weaponizing” plutonium extracted from the rods. If reprocessed with chemicals, the rods could yield enough plutonium for at least one nuclear  bomb, according to officials and nuclear experts in Seoul and Washington. Using the same procedure at Yongbyon, North Korea was believed to have already accumulated enough plutonium for six to eight bombs. On Monday, the North’s official news agency, K.C.N.A., said that the country  completed reprocessing the 8,000 rods two months ago  and had made “significant achievements” in turning the plutonium into an atomic bomb. “We have no option but to strengthen our self-defense nuclear deterrent in the face of increasing nuclear threats and military provocations from hostile forces,” the  news agency said. North Korea conducted  underground nuclear tests in October 2006 and in May. In April, it also test-fired a long-range rocket. If fully developed, the rocket, known as a Taepodong-2, is feared to have the capacity to deliver a nuclear warhead as far as North America. Those moves resulted in new  United Nations   sanctions. Now, North Korea is trying to draw the United States back to the negotiating table, where its threats to reactivate its Yongbyon nuclear complex and acquire more   bomb material serve as its strongest negotiating tool to obtain humanitarian aid, diplomatic recognition and other rewards. On Monday, North Korea pressed the United States for a decision about starting bilateral talks, warning that it was ready to proceed   with itsnuclear weaponsprogram. North Korea has also  said it was also enriching uranium. Highly-enriched uranium would give it  another route to build nuclear bombs.

Bill Clinton’s trip will have been well worth the effort if it laid the groundwork for truly productive talks on North Korea’s nuclear programs.

Sending a former president to secure the release of two journalists detained by North Korea was a big step, but Bill Clinton’s trip will have been well worth the effort if it laid the groundwork for truly productive talks on North Korea’s nuclear programs. Now it is up to President Obama to make it clear to Pyongyang that it is no longer good enough to make easily broken promises. Even before Mr. Clinton’s mission this week to rescue Laura Ling and Euna Lee from a 12-year sentence to North Korea’s gulag, Obama administration officials concluded that Pyongyang was looking for a face-saving way to re-engage with Washington. North Korea made a colossal mistake by getting off to a bad start with President Obama, who offered the kind of dialogue that President George W. Bush took far too long to embrace. The North Koreans responded by breaking off six-country negotiations, conducting a second nuclear test, and test-firing missiles. They also vowed to make more nuclear weapons and threatened military action against efforts to isolate it, and may have resumed nuclear fuel production. There are growing concerns about Pyongyang’s willingness to sell missiles and other technology to other states. We do not know the details of Mr. Clinton’s meetings, but we hope they lead to future talks. That poses a challenge for Mr. Obama: while he must pursue this opening, he must not be so desperate for a deal that he lets North Korea set all the terms. He struck the right note when he told MSNBC on Wednesday that Mr. Clinton’s mission had not eased the need for North Korea to alter its behavior if it wants a “path to better relations.” To start, that means not giving in to Pyongyang’s desire to make the talks a bilateral process with Washington. It is imperative to keep South Korea, Japan, China and Russia — key participants in any effective deal — engaged. Officials from Washington and Pyongyang can still meet separately, as they did under Mr. Bush. Most important, the United States and its partners need to make clear that the expectations are higher than they were before — that North Korea will not be rewarded again just for recommitting to promises that were broken before and likely will be broken again. Future steps toward disarmament must be irreversible. Under a 2005 agreement, North Korea shut down its reactor at Yongbyon — the source of plutonium for its nuclear weapons — and promised to dismantle its bomb-making infrastructure. It has since kicked out international inspectors and claims to be rebuilding and resuming its capabilities. One way to make disablement more permanent: pour concrete into the reactor core. The United States and its partners also have to re-establish their credibility; North Korea never received all the fuel deliveries promised under the 2005 deal. At the same time, however, Washington and its partners must keep enforcing the tougher Security Council sanctions imposed on Pyongyang in June. It is understandable to doubt that impoverished North Korea will ever abandon its nuclear program — its only form of leverage over the rest of the world. But patient — and firm — engagement backed by sanctions still offers the best path toward a peaceful solution, however tortuous it might be.

Former President Bill Clinton and the two freed journalists were greeted at the airport by family members and Al Gore, who founded the company that employs the journalists.

2009-08-06T00:00:00Z

WASHINGTON — Former PresidentBill Clintonarrived in the United States Wednesday morning after a dramatic 20-hour visit toNorth Korea, in which he won the freedom of two American journalists, opened a diplomatic channel to North Korea’s reclusive government and dined with the North’s ailing leader, Kim Jong-il. The private plane carrying Mr. Clinton and the journalists,Laura Ling, 32, andEuna Lee, 36, landed at 5:50 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time at Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, just outside Los Angeles. The two women stepped off the plane in jeans and sweaters, rushing down the stairs to be reunited with their families, who clustered around them. Ms. Lee, in tears, embraced her husband, Michael Saldate, and knelt to hug her 4-year-old daughter, Hana. Ms. Ling kissed her husband, Iain Clayton. Mr. Clinton stepped off the plane a few moments later, embracing former Vice President Al Gore, the founder of the media company that employs the journalists. “Thirty hours ago, Euna Lee and I were prisoners in North Korea,” Ms. Ling said in brief remarks to reporters, blinking back tears. “We feared that at any moment we could be prisoners in a hard labor camp. Then suddenly we were told that we were going to a meeting. “We were taken to a location and when we walked through the doors, we saw standing before us President Bill Clinton,” she said, recounting the final moments of her ordeal. “We were shocked, but we knew instantly in our hearts that the nightmare of our lives was finally coming to an end. And now we stand here home and free.” Mr. Gore then spoke. “President Obama and countless members of his administration have been deeply involved,” in the effort to bring the women home, he said. “To everybody who has played a part in this,” he said, “we are so grateful.” The North Korean government, whichin June sentenced the women to 12 years of hard laborfor illegally entering North Korean territory, announced hours before the jet’s departure from North Korea that it had pardoned the women after Mr. Clinton apologized to Mr. Kim for their actions, according to the North Korean state media. Mr. Clinton’s wife, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, said Wednesday that the administration was “extremely excited” that the women would be reunited with their families. But she denied that her husband had apologized. President Obama, who contacted the families of the women on Tuesday evening, said that he, too, was “extraordinarily relieved” at the journalists’ return. “I want to thank President Bill Clinton — I had a chance to talk to him — for the extraordinary humanitarian effort that resulted in the release of the two journalists,” Mr. Obama said outside the White House on Wednesday morning. Mr. Clinton’s mission to Pyongyang was the most visible by an American in nearly a decade. It came at a time when the United States’ relationship with North Korea had become especially chilled, after North Korea’s test of its second nuclear device in May and a series of missile launchings. It ended a harrowing ordeal for the two women, who were stopped on March 17 by soldiers near North Korea’s border with China while researching a report about women and human trafficking. They faced years of imprisonment in the gulag-like confines of a North Korean prison camp. And it catapulted Mr. Clinton back on to the global stage, on behalf of a president who defeated Mrs. Clinton in a bitter primary campaign last year, and who later asked her to be his secretary of state. Mrs. Clinton was deeply involved in the case, too. She proposed sending various people to Pyongyang — including Mr. Gore — to lobby for the release of the women, before Mr. Clinton emerged as the preferred choice of the North Koreans, people briefed on the talks said. About 10 days ago, these people said, Mr. Gore called Mr. Clinton to ask him to undertake the trip. Mr. Clinton agreed, as long as the Obama administration did not object. In an interview Wednesday with NBC’s “Today” show in Nairobi, Kenya, Mrs. Clinton said the final request to Mr. Clinton had come from the White House. “When the message came to us from the young women themselves, to their families, to former Vice President Gore, and then to the administration that sending my husband would be the best way to ensure their release, of course we took that very seriously, discussed it,” she said, according to a transcript. “The White House reached out, as they said, to my husband, to ask him if he would be willing to do that.” The riveting tableau, of a former president jetting into a diplomatic crisis while his wife was embarking on a tour of Africa in her role as the nation’s chief diplomat, underscored the unique and enduring role of the Clintons, even in the Obama era. At a news conference in Nairobi on Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton said the case of the captured Americans had been handled separately from America’s dispute with North Korea over its nuclear program. “We have been working hard on the release of the two journalists, and we have always considered that a separate issue,” she said. The future of the United States’ relationship with Pyongyang, she continued, was “really up to them.” Mr. Clinton’s trip to Pyongyang came just two weeks after North Korea issued a harsh personal attack on Mrs. Clinton, in response to comments she made comparing its nuclear test and missile launchings to the behavior of an attention-seeking teenager. The North Korean Foreign Ministry objected to her “vulgar remarks” and called her “a funny lady” who was neither intelligent nor diplomatic. “Sometimes she looks like a primary-school girl and sometimes a pensioner going shopping,” a spokesman said. The episode evidently did not stop consideration of sending her husband as an envoy. But the initiative was cloaked in secrecy and came after weeks of back-channel talks between the United States and North Korea through its United Nations mission. In addition to Mr. Gore, the White House’s list of potential candidates included Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico. North Korea signaled its desire to have Mr. Clinton act as a special envoy in conversations with Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee, who relayed that message to their families in the middle of July, according to a senior administration official. The message was passed to Mr. Gore, who contacted the White House, which then explored whether such a mission would be successful. Mr. Obama did not speak directly with Mr. Clinton before the mission. But his national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, contacted the former president to sound him out. The senior official said the administration did “due diligence” with the North Koreans to ensure that if Mr. Clinton went, he would return with the journalists. As president, Mr. Clinton had sent Mr. Kim a letter of condolence on the death of his father, Kim Il-sung, according to a former official. For Mr. Kim, the former official said, freeing the women was a “reciprocal humanitarian gesture.” Mr. Kim is believed to have suffered a stroke last year. American officials said they thought his declining health had set off a succession struggle, complicating the Obama administration’s dealings with the North. The families of the American journalists issued a statement saying they were “overjoyed” by news of the pardon and thanked Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton. “We especially want to thank President Bill Clinton for taking on such an arduous mission and Vice President Al Gore for his tireless efforts to bring Laura and Euna home,” the statement said. Current TVsaid in a statement that it was also “overjoyed” and that the hearts of its employees went out to Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee for “persevering through this horrible experience.” Mr. Clinton and the journalists traveled on a private jet owned by Stephen Bing, a real estate heir and a major Democratic Party contributor, who donated the use of the jet as a favor, said Andy Meyers, the chief executive officer of Shangri-la Industries, which was founded by Mr. Bing. Administration officials said Mr. Clinton went to North Korea as a private citizen, did not carry a message from Mr. Obama for Mr. Kim and had the authority to negotiate only for the women’s release. “This was 100 percent about the journalists,” said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter. “We knew Kim Jong-il would probably seek a meeting with Clinton. But that’s not what this visit was about.” Still, North Korea, clearly seeing a propaganda opportunity at home and a rare chance for a measure of favorable publicity abroad, welcomed Mr. Clinton with the fanfare of a state visit. It broadcast a group portrait, as well as photos of Mr. Kim gesturing and talking to Mr. Clinton; of the former president accepting flowers from a North Korean girl; and of Mr. Clinton, seated across a negotiating table from Mr. Kim, each flanked by  aides. Among those greeting Mr. Clinton at the airport was Kim Kye-gwan, North Korea’s chief nuclear negotiator. Among those accompanying Mr. Clinton was David Straub, a former director of the Korea desk at the State Department, who had held talks with the North Koreans through what is known as the “New York connection.” Also on hand was John Podesta, an informal adviser to the Obama administration who served as Mr. Clinton’s chief of staff in the final years of his presidency, when the former president yearned to travel to North Korea to clinch a deal that would have curbed its nuclear program. That visit never happened — partly because the White House concluded that a deal was not assured — and former President George W. Bush put the brakes on direct talks with North Korea, setting the stage for eight years of largely fruitless efforts to stop the North’s nuclear ambitions. Given Mr. Clinton’s stature and his long interest in the North Korean nuclear issue, experts said it was likely that his discussions in North Korea ranged well beyond obtaining the release of Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee. “It would be someplace between surprising and shocking if there wasn’t some substantive discussion between the former president, who is deeply knowledgeable about the nuclear issue, and Kim Jong-il,” said Robert L. Gallucci, who negotiated with North Korea in the Clinton administration. Mr. Clinton has sought to find the right place in the Obama era, eager to play a role without stepping on the toes of the new president or, certainly, the secretary of state. The last time the two had spoken, said the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, was in March, when Mr. Obama invited Mr. Clinton to a ceremony in Washington for signing legislation expanding the AmeriCorps program created by Mr. Clinton. In interviews last spring, Mr. Clinton said that he would be happy to do anything Mr. Obama asked him to do, but that “I try to stay out of their way.” Mr. Clinton’s mission may be less of an issue for Mr. Obama than for Mrs. Clinton. The same day he landed in North Korea, she arrived in Kenya, beginning an 11-day journey through Africa — a visit now largely eclipsed by her husband’s travels.

Kim Jong-il has pancreatic cancer and the illness is life-threatening, the South Korean broadcaster YTN said.
==::==
2009-07-14T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — The North Korean leaderKim Jong-il, who suffered a stroke last August, was also found to have “life-threatening” pancreatic cancer around the same time, a South Korean cable television network reported on Monday. The network, YTN, a cable news station, quoted unidentified Chinese and South Korean intelligence sources for the report, which was made by YTN’s correspondent in Beijing. The station did not explain how the sources obtained the sensitive medical information fromNorth Korea, an isolated, nuclear-armed state that has kept details of its leader’s health a closely guarded secret. South Korean officials said Monday that they could not confirm the report, but added that they were studying possible causes of Mr. Kim’s recent loss of weight. If the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer were true, Mr. Kim might not have much longer to live. Pancreatic cancer is one of the most difficult cancers to detect early. It spreads rapidly, and the fatality rate is high. The World Health Organization says fewer than 5 percent of patients with pancreatic cancer live longer than five years. Although Mr. Kim began making occasional public appearances a few months after he mysteriously disappeared last August, photographs of him and television images recently carried by the North Korean media showed him limping and frail. Mr. Kim’s loss of weight, in particular, has elevated speculation about the severity and nature of what is wrong with him. The Unification Ministry, a South Korean government agency in charge of relations with North Korea, “has no information” on Mr. Kim’s reported cancer, said Chun Hae-sung, a spokesman. The National Intelligence Service and other government agencies also said they could not confirm it, repeating their standard answer to a recent flurry of thinly sourced and often speculative reports about Mr. Kim’s health. Mr. Kim’s health is a topic of intense international interest, in large part because world leaders and governments are unclear about who would succeed him. North Korea is one of the world’s most unpredictable nations, and any transfer of power will focus new attention on the security of its nuclear arsenal. South Korean news media scrutinized every still photo and segment of television footage of Mr. Kim released by North Korea. In his latest public appearance last Wednesday at a memorial for his father, the founder of North Korea, Kim Il-sung, Mr. Kim looked thinner and appeared to have less hair than before. His mouth looked lopsided. That led to a slew of speculative reports, though Mr. Kim walked on his own into last week’s ceremony. “When I saw his loss of weight, I thought of diabetes or cancer,” said Hyun Jong-jin, a gastroenterologist at Korea University Anam Hospital in Seoul. “But by just looking at him in those pictures, you can not say he has a pancreatic cancer.” Doctors say that a person with chronic diabetes, a smoking habit and obesity is more likely to get pancreatic cancer. Mr. Kim before his reported stroke fits the description. The Seoul government has long suspected Mr. Kim of having diabetes. “We are looking into what his loss of weight means,” said a senior government official in Seoul who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing his department policy. “But if he is a pancreatic cancer patient, he is remarkably doing well because he is making quite a few public appearances.” Mr. Kim has made dozens of visits to military units, farms and factories this year, the Unification Ministry said, citing North Korean news reports. Mr. Kim inherited power after his father died in 1994 at the age of 82. American intelligence officials said last fall that Mr. Kim was seriously ill, although the exact nature of his illness has been a matter of speculation. A French neurosurgeon who has treated Mr. Kim said the North Korean leader did have a stroke last August. In December, the doctor, Francois-Xavier Roux, told Le Figaro, the French daily newspaper: “Kim Jong-il suffered a stroke but did not undergo an operation. He is now better.” In May, North Korea tested its second nuclear device in a move that shocked and angered the international community. Even China, the North’s closest ally, condemned the test. Mr. Kim has three known sons, and in recent months there have been widespread reports — many of them thinly sourced — that the youngest son, Kim Jong-un, has been designated the heir apparent.

The defense secretary warned North Korea that the U.S. will not accept it as a nuclear-armed state.

SINGAPORE — Defense SecretaryRobert M. GateswarnedNorth Koreaon Saturday that the United States would not accept it as anuclear weaponsstate and would consider any transfer of nuclear material to other countries or terrorist groups a “grave threat” to the United States and its allies. “We will not stand idly by as North Korea builds the capability to wreak destruction on any target in the region — or on us,” Mr. Gates told a major security conference here that has been dominated by North Korea’s test this week of a nuclear device and the firing of at least six short-range missiles, all in defiance of international sanctions. North Korea test-fired a missile on Friday, according to a South Korean defense official. North Korea, Mr. Gates said, had a choice: “To continue as a destitute, international pariah, or chart a new course.” Mr. Gates, who was speaking for the first time at the annual conference, called the Shangri-La Dialogue, as an emissary of his new commander in chief, said the new administration had limited patience with North Korea’s bellicose words and behavior. “President Obama has offered an open hand to tyrannies that unclench their fists,” Mr. Gates said. “He is hopeful, but he is not naïve. Likewise, the United States and our allies are open to dialogue, but we will not bend to pressure or provocation.” Military officials traveling with Mr. Gates said the tough talk was aimed at increasing worldwide pressure on North Korea as well as reassuring allies in the region, particularly Japan and South Korea, that the United States was committed to their defense should North Korea make good on talk of war this week. On Wednesday, North Korea threatened military strikes against the South. The officials acknowledged that the United States had only limited information about what was happening inside North Korea and suspected but did not know for certain that its leader, Kim Jong-il, was in the midst of political maneuvers to make his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, his successor. The officials described the country’s leadership as unpredictable and bizarre. Mr. Gates’s sharp language was met with some skepticism by at least one participant in the conference, a Hong Kong television commentator, who in a question-and-answer session after the defense secretary’s formal remarks noted that although Mr. Gates had declared that the United States would not recognize North Korea as a nuclear weapons state, it was already a “de facto nuclear weapons state.” The questioner asked about the next step for the United States and whether the long-running six-nation talks aimed at getting North Korea to abandon its nuclear program had failed. Mr. Gates responded that the next step was political and that the United States would send a team to Asia to “reassess” how to go forward with the talks. He acknowledged, “It would be hard to point to them at this point as an example of success.” Although North Korea was the “hot topic” at the conference, as Mr. Gates put it to reporters on his plane, he also used the forum to appeal to Asian allies for help, both financial and military, with the war in Afghanistan. “I know some in Asia have concluded that Afghanistan does not represent a strategic threat to their countries, owing in part to Afghanistan’s geographic location,” Mr. Gates said. “But the threat from failed or failing states is international in scope.” In representing Mr. Obama, Mr. Gates concluded that the United States, “in our efforts to protect our own freedom, and that of others” had “from time to time made mistakes, including at times being arrogant in dealing with others.” He did not name names, but then said, “We always correct our course.”

North Korea’s state-run media have released a flurry of reports of public appearances by its reclusive leader, Kim Jong-il.
==::==
2008-11-07T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL, South Korea —North Korea’s state-run media outlets have released a flurry of reports of public appearances by the North’s reclusive leader,Kim Jong-il, in what analysts on Thursday described as an effort to demonstrate to his people and the outside world that he is firmly in control, despite widespread rumors of ill health. Since Sunday, news outlets in the North have described three separate appearances by Mr. Kim, 66, who officials in Washington and Seoul have said probablysuffered a strokearound August and may have undergone brain surgery. In the latest such report, the North’s official news agency,KCNA, said on Thursday that Mr. Kim had attended a concert, where a state choir and opera groups performed numbers like “Please Receive Our Salute!” Photographs of Mr. Kim that have accompanied these reports have been studied by North Korea watchers in government and media. Aided by neurosurgeons and other experts, they have scrutinized every detail, from Mr. Kim’s facial expressions to background scenery, to gauge his condition. “The reports and release of his pictures are carefully calculated and timed,” said Ryoo Kihl-jae, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. “It’s Kim Jong-il’s way of responding to the intense outside attention to him. He is a man very sensitive to how the outside world views him.” But the photographs have raised as many questions as they have answered. North Korea’s state media did not say when the pictures were taken, confounding the analysts. Undated pictures released on Oct. 11, for example, showed Mr. Kim inspecting a military unit and looking healthy. But they showed green foliage, while trees on the Korean Peninsula at the time were tinged with red and gold. Then, on Sunday, North Korea issued two photos of Mr. Kim, saying he was watching a soccer match. This time, the background vegetation had appropriately autumnal colors. In one picture, he was smiling. The smile, experts said, was symmetrical enough to exclude any serious paralysis of the facial muscles, a common occurrence among people who suffered a stroke. Mr. Kim also had a full head of hair, despite reports that he might have had a brain surgery. But the experts also noted that in both pictures Mr. Kim’s left hand looked immobile, either resting limply on his lap or in a pocket. They also noted that he was not wearing the shoes he usually uses to elevate his short stature. Such details led news media to speculate that Mr. Kim might be suffering paralysis on the left side of his body. On Wednesday, 14 photographs were released that seemed intended to dispel such notions. They showed Mr. Kim walking about and clapping his hands. “The fact that the North is going to such lengths to demonstrate that Kim Jong-il is O.K. is, ironically, a sign that his health is not normal,” Mr. Ryoo said. Other analysts said the timing of recent reports about Mr. Kim was linked to the American presidential election. “Kim Jong-il wants to show that he is in control and that he has no problem being a partner of dialogue with the United States,” said Kim Yong-yun, a North Korea expert at Dongguk University. He suggested that the North Korean leader might soon stage a “foolproof” demonstration of his health, for example by releasing a video of his public activities or paying a courtesy call to the Chinese Embassy in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang. China is North Korea’s main ally.

The chief American negotiator forNorth Koreaextended his talks in Pyongyang, the capital, on Thursday in an effort to salvage a crumbling nuclear disarmament deal, while the South Korean media reported that the North had been upgrading its ballistic missile test site. The unconfirmed reports on the missile base, Musudan, which is on North Korea’s northeast coast, came as the American negotiator, Christopher R. Hill, an assistant secretary of state, met North Korean officials in Pyongyang  to try to persuade them not to restart their nuclear weapons program in Yongbyon. Mr. Hill had been expected to return to Seoul, South Korea, on Thursday, and officials in Seoul declined to speculate on whether the extension of his stay was a sign of progress.

The Berlin Wall might be a thing of the past, but the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea — the world’s most heavily armed border — is still a modern-day phenomenon. Americans who’d like to take a peek behind North Korea’s Iron Curtain, including the zone have a chance to do so this fall with two tours offered by Snow Lion Expeditions (www.snowlion.com), a Salt Lake City-based travel company. “We have a crack in the door for Americans to get in,” said Steve Pastorino, vice president of marketing for the company, who has found a way to procure visas for Americans through a partnership with Koryo, a British consortium of documentary filmmakers and tour guides who work regularly in North Korea. The 11-day tours visit both North and South Korea, using Beijing as a home base. Highlights of the itinerary include attending the Mass Games, a color-coded, athletic performance organized by the state, and visiting sites like Kumsusan Memorial Palace, the mausoleum of Kim Il-Sung. The trip starts at $5,895, including guides, lodging, meals and admission — but not flights.

The White House is split on how long to exercise patience without jeopardizing the fulfillment of an agreement.
==::==
2008-01-19T00:00:00Z

WASHINGTON — A debate is under way within the Bush administration over how long it can exercise patience withNorth Koreawithout jeopardizing the fulfillment of a nuclear agreement that President Bush has claimed as a foreign policy victory. With North Korea sending signals that it may be trying to wait out Mr. Bush’s time in office before making any more concessions, administration officials are grappling with how the United States should react. The debate has fractured along familiar lines, with a handful of national security hawks in Vice President Dick Cheney’s office and at the State Department arguing for a more confrontational approach with Pyongyang. On the other side, Mr. Bush’s lead North Korea nuclear negotiator, Christopher R. Hill, has argued that the United States should continue a more restrained approach, one that is widely credited with bringing about an agreement last year that is intended eventually to lead to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. While the restrained stance still appears to have support from Mr. Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, it is coming under fire from conservative critics, both in and out of the administration. In a public departure from administration policy, Jay Lefkowitz, a conservative lawyer who is Mr. Bush’s envoy on North Korean human rights, said this week the North would likely “remain in its present nuclear status” when the next president took over in January 2009. “North Korea is not serious about disarming in a timely manner,” Mr. Lefkowitz told an audience at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. “We should consider a new approach to North Korea.” At issue is a declaration that North Korea was supposed to make by the end of last year formally stating everything in its nuclear inventory. When the North missed that deadline, administration officials initially sought to minimize the significance of the lapse, but they have expressed increasing concern in the wake of a North Korean statement on Jan. 4, in which the North  insisted that it had already disclosed everything that it needed to. The North has cited a list of nuclear programs that it provided in November, but the United States has rejected the list as incomplete. “Some people make the argument that we’re just pursuing a policy of talks that go nowhere,” said one administration official with knowledge of the debate within the administration. John R. Bolton, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations, argued in a Wall Street Journal op-ed article last week that the Bush administration should dump the nuclear pact with North Korea because, he said, Pyongyang was not interested in giving up its nuclear program. “They’re in the classic North Korean role of deception,” Mr. Bolton said in an interview. “It’s like groundhog day; we’ve lived through this before.” Mr. Bush said the two countries needed to resolve three sticking points: the number of warheads that North Korea has built; the amount of weapons-grade nuclear material produced by North Korea; and the need for North Korea to disclose that it has passed nuclear material to others. The proliferation issue has taken on new importance after an Israeli strike in Syria in September, which American and Israeli officials said was conducted against a nuclear facility near the Euphrates River that was supplied with material from North Korea. Administration officials want North Korea to disclose what help it may have given Syria, although they also say that the help came before the North agreed to dismantle its nuclear reactor and disclose its nuclear programs. Mr. Bolton and other critics of the agreement, including the officials in Mr. Cheney’s office, never liked the pact to begin with, and advocates of the deal with North Korea say their second-guessing is expected. They argue that the Bush administration’s previous confrontational strategy with North Korea is part of what led to the North’s detonation of a nuclear device in October 2006. Besides the United States and North Korea, the other parties to the nuclear pact include China, South Korea, Japan and Russia. “People lambaste the six-party process, and sure, it offers no refuge for those in need of instant gratification,” Mr. Hill, the negotiator, said in an interview. “But when asked for alternatives” to the nuclear pact, Mr. Hill said, “even the noisiest critics fall silent.” Administration officials say that the North has remained true to one part of the October agreement: It has made great strides in disabling and dismantling its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon. “Bush can say, with credit, that he has achieved more than any other administration as far as dismantlement,” said Gary Samore, a vice president at the Council on Foreign Relations who helped negotiate the Clinton administration’s 1994 agreement with North Korea. “He can say that he managed to freeze further production, and handed the next administration a diplomatic process.” But Bush administration officials say that they want more than just dismantlement on their record, and insist that they have not written off their chances of getting North Korea to make a complete declaration of its nuclear programs before the end of the administration. Bush officials say they will not ultimately be able to verify that North Korea has got rid of its nuclear weapons program unless they first know what is in the program. “The issue of the declaration is important because that which they declare must later be abandoned,” a senior administration official said. The official, who asked that his name not be used because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue, said that the administration really wanted North Korea to provide an explanation for purchasing aluminum tubes that could be used to convert uranium gas into nuclear fuel. In its Jan. 4 statement, North Korea accused the United States and the other countries in the six-party talks of reneging on promises made under an October deal, including the shipment of one million tons of fuel and the removal of North Korea from the United States’ list of states that sponsored  terrorism. So far, North Korea has received about 150,000 tons of fuel, and Bush administration officials say the removal of the North from the terrorism list will depend on whether it meets the requirements of the October deal. North Korea agreed in October to dismantle   its nuclear facilities and to disclose all of its past and present nuclear programs by the end of 2007 in return for 950,000 metric tons of fuel oil or its equivalent in economic aid. Last month, Mr. Bush reached out directly for the first time to the North Korean leader,  Kim Jong-il, holding out the prospect of normalized relations with the United States if North Korea fully disclosed all nuclear programs and got rid of its nuclear weapons.

To the Editor: Re “Philharmonic Agrees to Play in North Korea” (front page, Dec. 10): The Philharmonic’s decision to play in Pyongyang is a brazen act that shows how music remains a powerful tool of communication. Let’s hope that this trip will create more room for dialogue between North Korea and the rest of the world. Looking at the long-term benefits, it’s difficult to concur with the arts critic Terry Teachout’s conclusion that the Philharmonic “will be doing little more than participating in a puppet show whose purpose is to lend legitimacy to a despicable regime.” The Philharmonic has more potential to engender mediation than a plethora of pertinacious talk or bombs would. And since this trip is intended to foster openness, in addition to playing Western works the Philharmonic should play some North Korean music. A cup of coffee with Kim Jong-il could turn sour, but North Korean tunes might help enliven the situation. Patrick Kabanda Andover, Mass., Dec. 10, 2007 The writer is the school organist and a music instructor at Phillips Academy.  To the Editor: As the most important orchestra in America, the New York Philharmonic is automatically one of the truly great symbols of Western civilization — a civilization that values reason, science, individual rights and artistic freedom. So it is appalling that the leadership of the Philharmonic has chosen to defile and devalue that great symbol by placing it in the service of one of the world’s bloodiest dictators. As the musicians are giving their usual world-class performance in a comfortable venue, North Korean children will be dying of starvation — a starvation that is the direct and inevitable result of having been denied their inalienable rights by the tyrant Kim Jong-il. There is a disturbing pattern emerging. First, New York University prohibited a student group from displaying the famous Danish cartoons. Then Columbia University invited President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran to visit the campus and present his views in a respected forum. Now we have the New York Philharmonic helping the North Korean regime to paint itself with a thin veneer of civilization. One by one, New York’s institutions are betraying the very culture on which their existence depends. Greg Elmlinger New York, Dec. 10, 2007  To the Editor: While the New York Philharmonic is to be congratulated for its historic coming trip to North Korea, I despair that our cultural policy toward Cuba must remain in the dark ages. When inaugurating the administration’s Global Cultural Initiative, Laura Bush stated that “one of the best ways we can deepen our friendships with the people of all countries is for us to better understand each other’s culture by enjoying each other’s literature, music, films and visual arts.” Our present policies deny such possibilities of friendship and cultural sharing with Cuba, and it’s time to change.

The government granted theWorld Food Programpermission to send four emergency teams to flood-stricken areas, to provide a wider independent assessment of the damage. Margareta Wahlstrom, the deputy emergency relief coordinator at the United Nations, said 58,000 homes had been destroyed along with nearly 222,400 acres of farmland, leaving 300,000 people homeless. She said 83 people were dead and about 60 missing. The United Nations said its relief officials in the region had reported that flood waters had wrecked more than 800 public buildings, 540 bridges, 70 stretches of railway and more than 500 electricity towers. More than 30 water reservoirs and 450 agricultural structures were damaged, it said. World Food Program officials planned to travel today to 10 hard-hit counties to assess immediate needs.

North Korea said that its dispute with the U.S. over $25 million frozen in a bank in Macao had been resolved, and that it would begin to shut down its main nuclear plant.

SEOUL, South Korea, June 25 —North Koreasaid Monday that its dispute with the United States over $25 million frozen in a bank in Macao had been resolved, and that it would begin to carry out its much-delayed promise to shut down its main nuclear plant. The first test of the North Korean commitment to stop and seal its main nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang, the capital, and an adjacent fuel-reprocessing plant, will come when officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency begin five days of negotiations on Tuesday in North Korea. The agency, the United Nations’ nuclear monitoring arm, and North Korean officials  will discuss a timetable for shutting down the reactor and technical details of monitoring and verification. Ever since the first suspicion of a North Korean nuclear weapons program surfaced in the early 1990s,  the agency and North Korea have bickered over how much access the agency should have to  nuclear facilities and data in the isolated country. “As the funds that had been frozen at Macao’s Banco Delta Asia have been transferred as we demanded, the troublesome issue of the frozen funds is finally resolved,” the official North Korean KCNA press agency quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying. “We too will start implementing the Feb. 13 agreement on the principle of action for action.” In the agreement reached in February with the United States and four other countries, North Korea promised to close the Yongbyon nuclear plant, which, according to American intelligence estimates, has produced enough plutonium for as many as a half dozen bombs. To ensure that North Korea keeps its promise, the United States made several concessions. It agreed to release the $25 million in North Korean funds, even though  the United States Treasury had blacklisted the bank in Macao as a main conduit of money-laundering  for North Korea. It also made a point of transferring the money to other North Korean accounts because the North wanted the United States to treat it as part of the international banking system. Then, Christopher R. Hill, the main American negotiator with North Korea on the issue, went to Pyongyang last week in part to show that the Bush administration, which once called North Korea part of an “axis of evil,” was treating it like a serious negotiating partner. The United States had promised to release the money by mid-March and in return North Korea  promised to shut down the reactor by mid-April. But the process took  longer than expected because few banks wanted to touch the money. Finally, Dalkombank, of Russia,  agreed to act as an intermediary. It said Monday that the money had been transferred to the Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea. North Korea said it would use the released money “for improving the standard of people’s living and humanitarian purposes,” as the United States demanded. But neither North Korea nor the United States elaborated on how to check whether the promise would be kept.

WASHINGTON, June 11 — The United States appears to be close to reaching a deal to transfer $25 million in frozen funds toNorth Korea, with Russia and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York acting as intermediaries, in hopes of getting North Korea to begin to dismantle its nuclear arms program, American officials said Monday. The funds have been frozen for nearly two years at a bank that the Bush administration has labeled a violator of American money laundering laws. Because of that label, the bank is barred from doing business with any bank in the United States. The bank,  Banco Delta Asia, is based in Macao, a semiautonomous region in China. It has been accused by the United States of helping North Korea finance its nuclear arms program, and carrying out counterfeiting and narcotics activities. In February, North Korea agreed to begin dismantling its nuclear program in return for several political and economic concessions, including the return of its frozen funds. It also insisted that the money being routed through an international bank in a transaction be in dollars. Major banks that were asked to facilitate the deal balked, however, and the money remained frozen. North Korea then continued to refuse to shut down its main nuclear plant, which the United States says is processing fuel for nuclear bombs. Several banks in China and the United States, including Wachovia Bank, refused to carry out the transaction. They cited a ruling by the Treasury Department in March that barred American banks from facilitating dollar transactions with the Macao bank. Recently,  a Russian bank agreed to be the vehicle for the transaction, American officials said, provided that it could obtain dollars to carry it out. With American laws barring American commercial banks from supplying the dollars, officials turned to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to facilitate the deal with North Korea. “The United States is working with Russian and Macanese authorities to facilitate the transfer” of North Korean funds that were previously frozen at Banco Delta Asia, said Molly Millerwise, a Treasury Department spokeswoman. “We appreciate the willingness of the Russian government to facilitate this transaction and the good cooperation of the Macanese authorities.” The Wall Street Journal reported details of the proposed deal on Monday. American officials said because the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was not a private bank, but part of the Federal Reserve system, it was not subject to American laws barring commercial transactions involving illicit funds. The system is independent of the government but run by presidential appointees. Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs, has said that as soon as the money is transferred to North Korea, the United States would demand that North Korean fulfill the commitments it made in February. The Bush administration has come under criticism, especially from conservatives, for making the deal with North Korea. Many of the critics charge that American officials were too trusting of the North’s intentions. North Korea agreed to disable its nuclear facilities in a deal with the United States, China, Russia, Japan and South Korea. The failure to unfreeze the $25 million has been frustrating to the Bush administration for weeks. In April, a senior Treasury delegation failed to get the money transferred after 13 days of talks in Beijing.

BEIJING, March 18 — The United States andNorth Koreahave resolved a standoff over North Korean funds frozen in a bank account in Macao, clearing the way for talks to focus on implementing a nuclear disarmament accord, Chinese and American officials said today. Christopher Hill, an assistant secretary of state who is the chief American envoy at the talks, said he met with representatives from the North Korea delegation over the weekend to explain the American position on $25 million in North Korea-related accounts  in Macao’s Banco Delta Asia. An 18-month investigation into the bank ended last week, putting responsibility for returning the funds to North Korea in the hands of the authorities in Macao. But funds connected to illegal activities, like money laundering, counterfeiting, and narcotics and weapons trafficking, are not supposed to be returned. North Korean officials have said several times in recent days that they will not move forward with their commitment to shut down Yongbyon by mid April unless they recover the $25 million.North Korean officials have sent mixed signals about whether the Treasury Department action satisfies their demands to end the dispute. Senior officials in Pyongyang have not yet indicated that they consider the Macao matter to be resolved. But the issue “will not be an impediment to our six-party talks,” Mr. Hill told reporters. The North Korean officials “made it very clear that they have begun their tasks for the purpose of denuclearization.” Chinese State Councilor Tang Jiaxuan told a group of visiting Japanese lawmakers today  that the United States  and North Korea had  resolved the dispute, Hidenao Nakagawa, secretary-general of Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party, told reporters. The United States, North Korea, China, Russia, South Korea and Russia reached an initial agreement on Feb. 13 that gave North Korea 60 days to shut down its facility for producing plutonium for nuclear weapons at Yongbyon in return for aid and security pledges. The six parties will convene on Monday in the Chinese capital to hammer out details of that agreement and establish working groups to discuss a variety of other diplomatic and security concerns. Daniel Glaser, a Treasury department official, completed talks on Saturday with banking authorities in Macao, who operate under Chinese sovereignty,   and traveled to Beijing today  to hold discussions about the financial issue. Meanwhile, Mr. Hill said he hopes to set up a working group to examine the delicate issue of whether North Korea has been seeking to make nuclear fuel from a second source, highly enriched uranium, as well as its better known effort to use plutonium for the same purpose. Bush administration officials initially raised allegations that the North had a clandestine uranium program underway in 2002, citing intelligence from Pakistan, which American officials said may have sold equipment for enriching uranium to North Korea. The allegations were one of the factors that led to a collapse of an earlier agreement to freeze North Korea’s plutonium program. North Korea in October exploded its first nuclear device, which was made using plutonium. Pyongyang has denied that it has sought to build bombs using highly enriched uranium, but North Korean officials have said recently that they are willing to discuss the matter with the United States.

Negotiators will consider a draft agreement that promises rare but limited steps toward curbing the North’s nuclear ambitions.

BEIJING, Friday, Feb. 9 (Reuters) — The prospect for progress  toward endingNorth Korea’s nuclear arms program brightened on Friday as negotiators considered a plan for the country  to suspend operations at its nuclear facilities within two months. The  Kyodo news agency in Japan  said the proposal, drafted by China after the first day of six-country talks in Beijing, would help the North meet its  needs for more energy  in return for concessions on its nuclear program. The reported  progress in the talks among  the two Koreas, China, the United States, Japan and Russia came after American   and North Korean negotiators held pathbreaking direct  talks in Berlin last month. Their meetings cooled tension that had grown  after North Korea  staged its first nuclear test blast in October and the United Nations responded with sanctions. Envoys to the new talks, which began Thursday, voiced hope that North Korea would accept measures to rein in its nuclear activities in return for aid and security assurances, as outlined in a deal that was hammered out in 2005 but never carried out. “We’ve gone 18 months without anything, and so we have to pick up the pace,”  the chief American  negotiator, Assistant Secretary of State Christopher R. Hill, told reporters just before the talks resumed on Friday. Citing unidentified United States  officials, NBC News reported that North Korea was offering to suspend and eventually disable its nuclear program and permit United Nations  inspections of facilities. In turn, the North  wants diplomatic relations with the United States, an end to United Nations  sanctions and hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel aid, NBC reported. In Beijing, Japan’s chief negotiator, Kenichiro Sasae, said the six sides still had much ground to cover. “It’s too early to discuss whether the draft agreement is acceptable, as each country is to present its ideas and I believe China has its own ideas,” Mr. Sasae told reporters. South Korea’s envoy, Chun Yung-woo, also  sounded a note of caution. The draft was a “fine one” as a basis for discussions, Mr. Chun told reporters, adding, “I don’t want to prejudge whether the discussions will be smooth.” North Korea’s envoy, Kim Kye-gwan, told the delegates on Thursday that his country  was “ready to make its first step” toward denuclearization, Russia’s Interfax reported, quoting an unidentified source close to the negotiations.

The United Nations Development Program agreed to cease $1.7 million in new projects in North Korea until completion of what Alejandro D. Wolff, the acting United States ambassador, called a “real, full, thorough, independent, investigative audit” and to end direct payments in hard currency to local staff members and vendors and recruitment through the North Korean government. The $2.7 million in programs that will go forward are those that directly benefit the people of North Korea, officials said. The action followed complaints from the United States and Japan that some money could be diverted to the government, a claim that North Korea dismissed as “ridiculous and nonsense.”.
