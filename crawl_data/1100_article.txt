After spending 18 months illegally in China in the mid-1980's and converting to Christianity, Kim Tae Jin was locked up for four years in North Korea's infamous prison camp No. 15 at Yodok. He fled North Korea a few years after his release and in 2001 found his way to South Korea, where he is a co-chairman of NK Gulag, a private group focusing on human rights in North Korea. For Mr. Kim, while securing those rights is an important goal, it comes second to a far more consequential one: evangelizing in North Korea.

The international community &#151; above all China &#151; has to quickly come up with a strategy for reeling in North Korea.

North Korea is again bullying its way into the headlines. On Tuesday, it shelled a South Korean island, killing two South Korean soldiers. Earlier this month it flaunted a new plant that could allow it to significantly increase the size of its nuclear arsenal. It is nearly impossible to know what is going on there, but these outbursts are almost certainly tied to the struggle over replacing the ailing leader, Kim Jong-il. The international community — above all China, the North’s main source of fuel and food and the only country with any clout there — has to quickly come up with a strategy for reeling in North Korea. The Obama administration has to press China hard to finally engage. China has long enabled North Korea, making clear that its only real concern is stability on its border. But China should realize that an erratic neighbor armed with nuclear weapons is anything but a recipe for stability. On Tuesday, it was still in denial. After the shelling, China called only for a resumption of six-party nuclear talks. It has said nothing about the enrichment plant. The attack on Yeonpyeong Island occurred after South Korean forces on exercises fired test shots into waters near the North Korean coast. We hope South Korea’s president is asking who came up with that idea. But the North should have protested, rather than firing on a populated area, wounding three civilians and 15 soldiers. South Korea showed admirable restraint earlier this year when the North Koreans torpedoed and sank a South Korean warship, killing 46 sailors. It needs to continue to exercise restraint, as difficult as that may be. Washington must underline that message, even as it rightly denounces the North’s belligerence. The enrichment plant is alarming because it gives the North a second way to produce fuel for nuclear weapons. And when the North owns up to one enrichment facility, who is to say there aren’t others hidden? Over the last several weeks, North Korean officials unveiled two ambitious new nuclear projects to three separate delegations of visiting American experts. In addition to an industrial-sized centrifuge plant, they are also building an experimental light water reactor, supposedly for energy production. Siegfried Hecker, a former chief of the Los Alamos nuclear lab who visited the centrifuge plant, called it “astonishingly modern.” He said the plant and the reactor could be converted to produce weapons. But he said they “appear to be designed primarily for civilian nuclear power, not to boost North Korea’s military capability.” Obama administration officials are right to be skeptical. North Korea did freeze its program for seven years, but repeatedly cheated on its commitments since — diverting enough plutonium from a reactor to build six to eight bombs, testing two nuclear devices and failing to dismantle its plutonium fuel program. The last time the North sat down with other members of the six-party talks was in 2008. Since then, North Korea tested a second nuclear device and has increasingly clashed with the South. Meanwhile, the United States backed South Korea and Japan in suspending energy aid, tightening United Nations sanctions and demanding that the North show serious purpose before talks resume. Mr. Obama has insisted that he won’t get played by the North, but administration officials have also left the door open to both reviving the six-party talks and bilateral negotiations. We see no evidence of a serious American strategy for getting there. For now, China, reinforced by United Nations sanctions, has the best chance of walking the North back from the brink. It must take the lead. But Washington must also re-engage.

North Korea also blamed South Korea for the death of a South Korean tourist last week.

SEOUL,South Korea—North Koreablamed South Korea for the death of a South Korean tourist last week, and rejected an offer by PresidentLee Myung-bakof South Korea offer to resume dialogue as “a laughable cheap trick.” “It contains nothing new,” the North’s main state-run newspaper, Rodong, said of Mr. Lee’s offer in a commentary carried on a North Korean Web site. “He is repeating what his underlings had been trumpeting.” The commentary said Mr. Lee’s proposal was “not worth our consideration” because it lacked a firm South Korean commitment to be bound by the summit agreements reached between Lee’s predecessors and North Korean leader Kim Jong-il  —  accords the North accused Mr. Lee of flouting. The North’s strident posture, coupled with the standoff over the shooting death, signaled a prolonged chill in inter-Korean relations. Also on Sunday, South Korea issued a statement declaring that the killing of the woman “cannot be justified under any circumstances” and urging the North to cooperate in an investigation. “If we don’t investigate this tragic incident thoroughly, it will throw cold water on people’s expectations to improve inter-Korean relations through dialogue,” the statement said. “The North needs to take measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again.” Mr. Lee had proposed the resumption of the stalled talks on Friday despite learning of the shooting just 90 minutes before his speech. North Korea has refused to permit South Korean officials to enter to investigate the shooting. “The responsibility for the incident entirely rests with the South side,” the government bureau that oversees the Kumgang resort said in a statement, according to the official Korean Central News Agency. The tourist, Park Wang-ja, had been a guest at the resort near Diamond Mountain, a tourism zone at the southeastern tip of North Korea. The North Korean agency said in its statement that Ms. Park was killed after she “intruded deep” into the military zone and ignored repeated orders to stop, and warning shots. The statement expressed regret over the death, but it also demanded that South Korea “make a clear apology.” The shooting and the North Korean response clouded the offer by Mr. Lee to resume a dialogue and provide humanitarian aid to North Korea. What could have been considered a bold initiative, an unexpected policy reversal intended to thaw the chill in inter-Korean relations, was quickly overwhelmed by furor.

Since the sinking of a warship nearby, residents fear more for their livelihoods than their safety.

BAENGNYEONG ISLAND,SOUTH KOREA— As his tourist boat steered toward a gray-blue sea through a billowy mist, Lee Jeong-oh remembered the day his business went down with a South Korean warship blasted and sunk only a couple kilometers off this island. “At first I couldn’t believe thatNorth Koreadid it,” said Mr. Lee, 53, slowing his craft to a stop at the spot where theCheonan, a South Korean Navy corvette, sank with 46 sailors aboard on the night of March 26. “I never imagined that a North Korean submarine would come all the way around our island for a torpedo attack, right below our feet here. “Poor sailors,” he said. “But life goes on here as usual.” Not quite. Like South Koreans in general, the 5,000 farmers and fisherfolk on this border island have grown so used to North Korean provocations and an uneasy truce on the divided Korean Peninsula that they appear to accept the Cheonan sinking as a matter of fate. But stop any of the residents and ask about their biggest worries, and they mention not the North Korean military threats but the sharp decline in the number of tourists following the sinking and all the publicity that has gone with it. Tourists used to arrive by ferryloads. They came here to sail along coastal bluffs where spotted seals doze on rocks. They also came to watch North Korea just over the horizon, the forbidden territory until recently more an intriguing mystery than a threat. Usually a trip to the island gives tourists from the South Korean mainland the thrill of getting close to North Korea while being cut off from the rest of their own country. After the Cheonan sinking, that thrill turned into a real fear. “People think that if they come here and war breaks out, they will all die,” said Chung Cheol-soo, an island resident. On the night of the sinking, another islander, Chang Hyung-soo, rushed out of his house when the offshore sky lit up with flares and thundered with guns. Unbeknown to him, a South Korean warship was starting a barrage at an object it had believed was a North Korean submarine slipping away after blasting the Cheonan but was later determined to have been a flock of north-bound migrating birds. “I told myself, ‘There they go again — our military training.’ And then I went back in to sleep,” said Mr. Chang, 67. “We won’t know we have a war until an enemy artillery shell falls in our front yard.” This nonchalance stands in stark contrast with Seoul’s official rhetoric. A large placard put up by the military at the center of the island reads: “Never forget the Cheonan! Remember 46 brave sailors! Let’s defend our northwestern islands with our lives!” The United States has sided with Seoul in the matter. “We are determined to show that our alliance is standing very firmly together during an absolutely critical period,” the U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, Kurt M. Campbell, said Thursday when he met Foreign Minister Yu Myung-hwan in Seoul. Earlier this week, at the United Nations in New York, the North Korean representative repeated his government’s denial of involvement in the Cheonan sinking and warned that if the Security Council endorsed a South Korean argument that the Cheonan was attacked by a North Korean torpedo, the North Korean military would lash out. “It’s just Kim Jong-il continuing his nonsense talk,” said Mr. Lee, the tourist boat captain. “Nothing has changed in our life.” This small island is just 16 kilometers, or 10 miles, from the North Korean coast. But for the civilian population and thousands of marines stationed here, their only regular link to mainland South Korea is a 220-kilometer, four-hour ride on a ferry, which sails in a broad curve to stay outside the range of North Korean artillery. Baengnyeong is the only place in South Korea where high school students and homemakers join regular military drills that use live ammunition. Its hills bristle with military antennas. Mines and steel columns guard its shorelines. Anyone seen on the beaches after dusk risks being shot. Across a narrow channel, North Korea has amassed two army divisions, whose artillery and rockets could zero in on this island. Hidden in coves and caves, 360 North Korean war vessels, including 13 submarines, stand ready to forge across, said Kim Young-chan, a South Korean Marine lieutenant stationed at a hilltop observation post overlooking the channel. “The waters around here are a tinderbox,” he said. Against all odds of leading a normal life, civilian residents here are determined to go about their business, but worried that  uneasiness over the waters around their island is driving off tourists. Mr. Chung said almost all 4,800 tourists who had booked trips to Baengnyeong in April and May with his company, Canari Tourism, canceled their plans. In June, business has been one-tenth its normal level. Lee Yun-cheol, 47, a fisherman and owner of a restaurant on the island, said that after the Cheonan sinking, he got calls from friends as far away as the United States, questioning why he lives in a dangerous place. Baengnyeng receives intense news coverage every time tensions flare up between the two Koreas — during the North’s nuclear test last year or when the two navies fought bloody skirmishes in 1999 and 2002, and again during a naval clash last November. That last battle was tool place close enough for the island’s residents to hear gunfire. But islanders say no previous crisis drove off tourists the way the Cheonan sinking did. Lee Joon-hee, 71, a rice farmer, said most islanders were so accustomed to the front-line life they were barely conscious of the potential danger of living on an island surrounded by waters claimed by North Korea. “As far as we are concerned, the only difference the Cheonan has made is that tourists don’t come,” said Mr. Lee, the tourist boat captain. “A swarm of reporters has landed here. That drives off tourists. I say, ‘What crisis?”’

ISLAMABAD,Pakistan—Abdul Qadeer Khan, the  founder of Pakistan’s atomic weapons program who confessed four years ago to having run an illicit global nuclear proliferation network, expressed hope in an interview published Wednesday that the new  government would end his house arrest and lift the restrictions on his movements. In the interview, his first since 2004 when he was put under house arrest in Islamabad, Dr. Khan, 72, bitterly complained about his confinement and what he described as his deteriorating health. The interview was published by Nawa-i-Waqt, an Urdu-language newspaper,   and its sister English-language publication, The Nation. It was unclear precisely when the interview had been conducted and whether it had been done in person or by telephone. Ayesha Khan, one of Dr. Khan’s two daughters, said in an interview on Wednesday evening that there were no signs of her father’s immediate release and that the family had not been approached by any official of the government of Yousaf Raza Gilani, the new prime minister. “Nobody has come to us,” she said. “The hope has always been there, but we are not holding our breath,” Ms. Khan said when asked if the family was optimistic about the lifting of the restrictions on her father. Information Minister Sherry Rehman could not be reached Wednesday  for comment. Dr. Khan, a metallurgist known here as the “father of the bomb,” is considered a national hero despite his tearful public apology on state-run television in which he said he sold nuclear technology to several countries. Last year, the government of PresidentPervez Musharrafeased some restrictions on Dr. Khan, and he was allowed to meet close friends after an authorization issued by the director of the Strategic Plans Division, which is responsible for handling Pakistan’s nuclear program. Family members said not much had changed. Ms. Khan also said that her father’s health was deteriorating. “Given his age and prolonged stress, obviously he is having stress-related issues,” she said. In the published interview, Dr. Khan dismissed claims by Mr. Musharraf that his health was stable. “My lower limbs are losing vitality and I am suffering from extreme lethargy,” he was quoted as saying. He also said that his blood pressure was “unmanageable day by day.” In early 2004, Dr. Khan shocked the world with a detailed confession in which he admitted that during the previous 15 years he had providedIran,North KoreaandLibyawith the designs and technology to produce the fuel for nuclear weapons. He was pardoned because of his national stature, but under an arrangement with Mr. Musharraf he was placed under house arrest indefinitely. Nawaz Sharif, the former prime minister  who leads the Pakistan Muslim League-N, which is a member of the newly elected government coalition, has been critical of Mr. Musharraf’s decision to put Dr. Khan under house arrest. Pakistan conducted its nuclear tests in 1998, when Mr. Sharif was the prime minister.

BEIJING, March 17 —North Koreasent mixed signals on its nuclear disarmament plans on Saturday, claiming that it had begun preparations to shut down its main facility for making nuclear fuel but also that it would not take action unless it received  all the money frozen when the United States slapped financial penalties on aMacaobank. As a new round of nuclear talks was scheduled to get under way in Beijing on Monday, Kim Kye-gwan, North Korea’s envoy, said the country “will not stop its nuclear activity” until its full  $25 million at Banco Delta Asia in Macao is returned. The United States maintains that the return of the money is now up to banking officials in Macao, a Chinese territory. But another North Korea diplomat, Kim Song-gi, said Saturday  that the country would  move to shut down the  nuclear facility, at Yongbyon, as it is obligated to do in April under a Feb. 13 agreement with the United States and four other nations.

The current crisis over North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons has unmistakable parallels with the events of spring 1994.
==::==
2009-08-04T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL — The current crisis over North Korea’s pursuit of nuclear weapons has unmistakable parallels with the events of spring 1994. Then, as now, North Korea was plunging ahead to make bomb-grade plutonium at its nuclear complex in Yongbyon. Then as now, the United States was rallying international support for sanctions against the North. Tensions spiked as North Korea warned it would consider any sanctions an “act of war.” There is, however, one key difference. In 1994, the United States was prepared to attack the North Korean nuclear complex, says Kim Young-sam, who was South Korea’s president at the time. That prospect prompted South Korea to reject any moves against the North. How Seoul responded to Washington’s handling of the crisis in 1994, as Mr. Kim described it in a recent interview, illuminates South Koreans’ continuing quandary in the long-running nuclear standoff: They may loathe North Korea for having invaded the South in 1950,  for starving its people, for building nuclear weapons. But, with the carnage of the Korean War still fresh in their collective memory,  they also recoil whenever they sense the United States is pushing North Korea too hard, fearful this might provoke Pyongyang to lash out in a suicidal attack. In 1994, Mr. Kim said, “the Americans were quite adamant about attacking Yongbyon. They had 33 warships positioned off the east coast.” He envisioned an apocalyptic scene in Seoul,  just 65 kilometers, or 40 miles, from the border, within striking distance of North Korean artillery and rockets. “I said absolutely no to the United States unilaterally bombing Yongbyon,” Mr. Kim said. “The North Korean artillery would have been rolling out within three minutes, and Seoul would have turned into a sea of fire.” Mr. Kim can hardly be accused of spinelessness before an adversary. He had his two military-backed predecessors arrested on corruption and sedition charges, forever shutting the military out of South Korean politics. But his rush to shield North Korea from an American strike speaks volumes about the complicated mix of disdain and fear, kinship and even nationalistic pride South Koreans   —   even many politically conservative, anti-Communist  South Koreans  —  feel about the North. U.S. officials came to appreciate this mentality during the subsequent decade of liberal rule, from 1998 till 2008. As the government engaged North Korea, surveys showed that the South Korean public considered the United States a bigger threat to peace than North Korea. One liberal politician  said that if the United States planned to attack Yongbyon, he would lead thousands of  “peace-loving” South Koreans across the border to form a human shield around the nuclear complex. Such emotionally charged friction between Seoul and Washington has subsided in recent years, as the governments of President Lee Myung-bak in Seoul and President Barack Obama in Washington conclude that they can prevail against the North only if they forge a united approach. Still, the South Korean outlook  —  distrusting the North, but wary of U.S. intervention against the North —  remains fundamentally unchanged. In 1994, as the United States prepared to evacuate American civilians and beefed up forces here, the South Korean stock market plummeted. Citizens stockpiled instant noodles and candles. This spring, when North Korea conducted a nuclear test and launched a long-range rocket, the local markets and the public hardly blinked, confident the United States would not take military action. U.S. officials tend to view the North’s nuclear program within the global framework of combating proliferation. But to ordinary South Koreans, it is just a latest episode in the decades-old hostilities from the Korean War, which halted with a cease-fire in 1953 and has yet to end with a formal peace. Opinions among South Koreans on how to resolve the nuclear crisis depend on how they see the North Korean government. Is it an evil regime bent on keeping its dictatorial grip on a starving people and building nuclear bombs to deter meddling from the outside? Or is it a cornered beast whose threats are a desperate cry for a way out? Whichever side they take, ordinary South Koreans hardly see the nuclear crisis in global terms, but rather within the highly local context of how to end the war and possibly reunify the peninsula. That partly explains why South Korean leaders over the years, both conservative and liberal, were eager for a meeting with their North Korean counterparts. Mr. Kim almost had one. Like most South Koreans of his generation, Mr. Kim, 81, harbors a visceral mistrust of North Korea. His mother was murdered in 1960 by a North Korean agent who attacked his island village. But when former President Jimmy Carter of the United States traveled to Pyongyang to help defuse the nuclear crisis in 1994 and returned with a proposal for an inter-Korean meeting, Mr. Kim readily accepted it. He saw a momentous opportunity as a politician. “Unifying the fatherland” is an idea drilled into the heads of schoolchildren on both sides of the border. Koreans’ greatest historical grievance is the peninsula’s division by the United States and Soviet Union at the end of World War II. Mr. Kim was to meet the North Korean leader, Kim Il-sung, in Pyongyang on July 25, 1994. But two weeks beforehand, on July 8, the 82-year-old Kim Il-sung died of a heart attack. “Fate played a trick on me,” Mr. Kim said with a tone of regret. “If I had met Kim Il-sung, I would have changed the nation’s history.” The achievement that had eluded him  —  becoming the first South Korean leader to hold a summit meeting with North Korea  —  went to Mr. Kim’s rival and successor, Kim Dae-jung. In 2000, Kim Dae-jung flew to Pyongyang and met with Kim Jong-il, Kim Il-sung’s son and successor. That year, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Today, Kim Young-sam remains the outspoken conservative critic of North Korea, while Kim Dae-jung is still the tireless evangelist for engaging it. “Over the years, both the Americans and we have conducted many negotiations with the North Koreans, but all of them failed,” Kim Young-sam said. “We can never trust the North Koreans.” But during the interview at his Seoul residence, decorated with photos of Mr. Kim smiling and posing with American leaders, Mr. Kim said he was proud of having averted war by stopping his U.S. ally from attacking Yongbyon  — even though he concedes that this may have emboldened Pyongyang. “Looking back,” he said, “I think the North Koreans think they can say whatever they want because no matter what they do, the Americans will never attack them.” Such is the South Korean dilemma.

Choi Se-woong defected from North Korea in 1995 and has since built a reputation as one of the most prominent North Korean entrepreneurs in the South.
==::==
2010-11-11T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL — Choi Se-woong’s day is just like that of many other businessmen here. He wakes up at 5:30 a.m., checks the news headlines with a cup of coffee and then drives to work in the financial district of Yeouido. What makes Mr. Choi different is the unusual path he took in his life. He defected from North Korea in 1995 and has since built a reputation as one of the most prominent North Korean entrepreneurs in the South. “I have Kim Jong-il to thank for finding the job of my life,” said Mr. Choi, 49, referring to the North Korean leader. He spoke between puffs on a cigarette at a coffee shop in a Seoul hotel recently. Growing up, Mr. Choi was one of the privileged few, eventually studying German literature at Kim Il-sung University. His family had connections to the government — his father is Choi Hee-byeok, who was North Korea’s de facto finance minister as director of the finance and accounting department of the Workers’ Party. It was Kim Jong-il who suggested to the elder Mr. Choi that his son should learn finance. Today, Mr. Choi is a managing director of foreign exchange marketing with NH Investment & Futures, a futures brokerage house in Seoul. He lives with his two children and wife, Shin Yeong-hee, who was once a dancer at Mansudae Art Theater, a prestigious art troupe in North Korea. Mr. Choi’s first encounter with capitalism was in 1984, when he went to work in Vienna at the Golden Star Bank, which at that time was the only North Korean bank abroad. (The bank eventually shut down in 2004, long after Mr. Choi’s time there, as international suspicion about illegal activities at the bank rose.) Several years after he arrived in Vienna, Mr. Choi moved on to London and worked at Development Investment Bank, a foreign exchange trading firm that has since closed and was set up by Daesong Bank of North Korea and a British entrepreneur. “The education I got associated capitalism with imperialism and aggression,” he said. “I thought it would be cold, like lacking humanity and loyalty among friends.” While in London, Mr. Choi ended up lending the money he had made to the North Korean Embassy. “The embassy didn’t get much support from the regime in the ’90s,” he said. It was while in London that Mr. Choi decided he would not go back to North Korea. He said that he had become “fed up” with the system and did not want to raise his children there. He declined to be more specific because he feared retaliation against family members still in the North. Before his defection, his father lost his position in a political reshuffle, meaning that Mr. Choi’s life upon return would be less privileged. He arrived in South Korea on Dec. 12, 1995, via a route he declined to disclose to prevent a crackdown on potential defectors. Now, 15 years later, Mr. Choi is still fighting. “It’s a constant battle,” he said. In 2009, 2,927 North Koreans defected to the South, up from 1,000 in 2002. The number is rising each year, and the Unification Ministry predicts that the total number of defectors will soon exceed two million. Getting a job is a big challenge for North Korean defectors, in part, observers say, because of education and in part because of prejudice. A recent survey showed that 13.7 percent of defectors between 15 and 64 years old were jobless as of last November, about four times the unemployment rate for South Koreans. Those who landed jobs earned an average of just 1.27 million won, or about $1,100, a month last year, which is less than half of the average income in Seoul. Mr. Choi has had more luck, thanks to his education and experience. Soon after he arrived in South Korea, he got a job at Korea Financial Telecommunications and Clearings Institute, a company that manages payment systems between banks. At the height of the Asian financial crisis, Mr. Choi tried his luck in the restaurant business. In 1998, he opened a restaurant named Jinadallaegak, specializing in North Korean-style naengmyeon, or cold noodles. The restaurant gave him enough capital by the year 2000 to set up SN Bank, a company providing 24-hour online foreign currency trading for individuals and small businesses. It was believed to be the first such service in South Korea. SN Bank was having financial problems and he sold it in 2006. He held several other finance jobs, increasing his pay all the while. Most recently, he joined NH in October, having been recruited after conducting a training course for employees there. Not all has been smooth. He was once sued by an employee at his restaurant when he refused to give the worker a raise. And when he developed the 24-hour online foreign currency trading service, his business partner tried to take credit for it. There are certain things anybody doing business in Korea should learn, he said: drinking and golf. Kim Jong-il ordered all North Koreans living overseas to stop drinking alcohol. So when he arrived in the South, he flatly refused to drink. Only later did he realize it was considered rude, and he now drinks alcohol. As for golf, Mr. Choi joked that his game had gotten so good that no one could tell anymore that he came from the North. Kim Hyung-eun is a business reporter at Korea JoongAng Daily.

North Korea’s government appears to be trying to build a personality cult around Kim Jong-un, the youngest son of Kim Jong-il.
==::==
2010-04-25T00:00:00Z
==::==
SUNGNAM, South Korea — The black-and-white photographs that were published last month in a North Korean newspaper appear no different from other propaganda coming fromNorth Korea: they show the supreme leader,Kim Jong-il, touring a steel plant in a fur cap and his trademark sunglasses. It is the pudgy but stern-faced young man next to him, dressed in a snappy Western suit and dutifully scribbling in a notebook, who has spurred intense speculation. Could this unidentified man be just a plant manager? Or could this be the first public appearance ofKim Jong-un, the North Korean leader’s third son and heir apparent? “There, see how his face is in focus and illuminated even more than Kim Jong-il himself?” said Cheong Seong-chang, a specialist on North Korean politics at the Sejong Institute. “There is a high possibility that this is Kim Jong-un.” Little is known about the inner workings of the secretive North Korean government, not even the identity of the heir apparent. But if Mr. Cheong is right, the enigmatic photographs are the latest signs of the desperate push that the North Korean government is making to build a cult of personality around the son, who is believed to be 27, to prepare him to assume control as the current leader’s health declines. The elder Mr. Kim, 68, appeared to suffer a stroke two years ago, and there have been recent reports that he is suffering from kidney disease. Analysts say that if Mr. Kim dies too soon, his son could be pushed aside in a scramble for power among political and military elites that would end the family’s dynastic rule and might even bring about the collapse of the impoverished totalitarian state. While this internal struggle is going on, problems continue to mount. A ham-handed currency revaluation last fall, aimed at reasserting central control over the economy, is reported to have badly backfired, producing unrest and disaffection with the government. At the same time, the spread of cellphones and DVD players has broken the North’s self-imposed isolation, giving many of its citizens a sense for the first time of how poor and backward their country has become. Recently, the government is said to have given mass promotions and luxury cars to officers in the nation’s powerful military, in a bid to cement their loyalty. Indeed, the sinking last month of a South Korean warship, which many South Koreans now suspect was the work of a North Korean torpedo, is widely seen in the South as a show of strength by the North aimed at winning the military’s support for the younger Mr. Kim. Despite the breakdown of communications barriers, reliable information on the political system remains scant. Photographs like those that appeared in last month’s Rodong Sinmun, the ruling party’s newspaper, are among the limited evidence that analysts and intelligence experts must rely on as they try to understand the efforts to shore up the Kim dynasty for a third generation. “This remains Kremlinology,” said Lee Ki-dong, a researcher on North Korea at the Institute for National Strategy, referring to the cold-war-era study of politics in the former Soviet Union. “We have to scrutinize the Rodong Sinmun as if we were looking for nuggets in a gold mine.” Not much is known about the man who could become the next leader of the unpredictable, nuclear-armed country, even including what he looks like. The only firsthand account comes from a Japanese chef who once worked for the Kim family and knew Kim Jong-un only as a personable and precocious boy.  The only known photograph of him was taken when he was 11 years old. It is also unknown whether Kim Jong-un has any rivals. For a time, North Korea watchers regarded the leader’s eldest son, Kim Jong-nam, 39, as the most likely heir — until he was caught by Japanese authorities using a fake passport to visit Tokyo Disneyland. He now lives in Macao, giving occasional paid interviews to Japanese television. Reports out of North Korea indicate that the government is trying to build a cult of personality around Kim Jong-un, just as it did during the last succession, when the current leader replaced his father, the North’s founder, Kim Il-sung. But while Kim Jong-il is believed to have had two decades as heir before assuming power after his father’s death in 1994, his son is being rolled out much faster. Moreover, some experts say, the average North Korean is growing worldly and aware of life outside the country’s borders, making it increasingly unlikely that the government’s often bizarre propaganda efforts will succeed. On Monday, the Daily NK, a Web site that specializes in information on North Korea, said it had obtained aninternal propaganda documentthat called Kim Jong-un the Youth Captain and quoted his father (who has his own title, Dear Leader) praising his loyalty and good works. The documents also extolled the son for such achievements as managing a fireworks display last year in Pyongyang, the capital, and becoming a proficient driver of military vehicles, the Daily NK reported. “He is a genius of geniuses,” the document says. “He has been endowed by nature with special abilities. There is nobody on the planet who can defeat him in terms of faith, will and courage.” Mr. Cheong, the analyst, said that members of local North Korean work units and government employees had been taught a new song titled “Footsteps,” which lauds Kim Jong-un’s fitness to follow his father as leader. Kim Jong-il has been rushing to prepare the ground for his son in other ways, analysts say. They said that wiretaps of North Korean phones by the South’s intelligence agency revealed that the younger Mr. Kim was appointed to a top post in the ruling party’s internal security apparatus last year and that he now worked in the same building as his father. The analysts have offered many predictions about what may happen when the current leader does die. One is that his brother-in-law, Jang Song-taek, 64, widely seen as the second most powerful member of the inner circle, could serve as a regent until the younger Mr. Kim is ready to rule — or simply hold onto power for himself. “The signs are that the elite do not take Kim Jong-un seriously,” said Kim Yeon-su, a professor of North Korean studies at the National Defense University in Seoul. “This is the final stage of the Kim family dictatorship.”

SEOUL, South Korea — The United States has proposed to meet withNorth Koreato discuss for the first time in six years bringing home the remains of any American soldiers buried there. North Korea, one of the world’s most isolated countries, has no diplomatic ties with the United States, with which it is still technically at war. “The U.S. recently sent a letter requesting a meeting on resuming remains recovery in North Korea,” Maj. Carie A. Parker, a spokeswoman for theDefense P.O.W./Missing Personnel Officeof the Pentagon, said on Tuesday. “We have received no response from North Korean officials regarding the request.” There are almost 8,000 American service members still unaccounted for from the Korean War, which ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. Major Parker said that North Korean officials contacted the Pentagon recently indicating that they would look favorably on an American request to discuss the possibility of recovering remains. North Korea last year accused Washington of ignoring its offer to discuss repatriating “lots of U.S. remains” that were “being dug out and scattered here and there in our country.” The Pentagon’s decision to react to the latest overture from the North followed a visit to New York by Kim Kye-gwan, a senior North Korean diplomat, in late July. Mr. Kim met Stephen W. Bosworth, Washington’s special envoy to six-nation talks aimed at endingNorth Korea’s nuclear weaponsprograms. Washington’s invitation for Mr. Kim and its decision to engage North Korea over the American remains came as the United States investigated ways of restarting the nuclear talks, suspended since 2008. After ignoring decades of American appeals to search for and return service members’ remains, North Korea handed over what it claimed were 208 sets of remains from 1990 to 1994. The boxes contained scattered bones and personal effects. American forensic experts believed the boxes actually contained the remains of as many as 400 individuals. They have been unable to identify most. American experts were allowed in North Korea in 1996 to guide more scientific recovery efforts. Thirty-three joint on-site missions yielded more than 220 sets of remains. About 80 have been identified and returned to families for burial. But the operations were halted in 2005 after Washington took issue with the safety and security of its workers. North Korea has reportedly earned millions of dollars for cooperation over the remains recovery. It has also used the matter to try to entice the United States into bilateral talks. Washington insists that any talks be within a multilateral framework. “If thousands of U.S. remains buried in our country are washed off and lost due to the U.S. side’s disregard, the U.S. side should be wholly responsible for the consequences as it has developed the humanitarian issue into a political problem,” the North’s official Korean Central News Agency said in April 2010. During his visit to Pyongyang, the North’s capital, in December, former Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico said, a top North Korean general offered to help return the remains of several hundred American troops.

SEOUL, South Korea — The North Korean military, the world’s fourth-largest, has bolstered its special-forces units during the past two years and has deployed a new battle tank, called the Storm, while expanding its tank brigades, the South Korean Defense Ministry said on Thursday in its biennial white paper. The report said the North’s overall troop strength had remained the same since 2008, when the active-duty force was estimated at 1.1 million. With a population of 24 million,North Koreahas by far the world’s largest military in per capita terms. In actual numbers of troops, only China, the United States and India are larger. The South Korean military has 688,000 troops, making it the sixth-largest over all, according toGlobalSecurity.org, a public policy organization focused on military and security issues. Some 28,500 American troops are also based in South Korea. Defense officials in Seoul said Thursday that the North had steadily upgraded its capabilities in asymmetric warfare and was better able to strike the South in unconventional and unpredictable ways. A rise in special-operations troops, to 200,000 from 180,000, was indicative of that shift in strategy. The white paper said the North’s new battle tank, the Pokpung-ho, was apparently based on former Soviet and Russian models. It was estimated that the North now had 4,100 tanks in service, up from 3,900 in 2008. Defense officials declined to comment on how the ministry had gathered the information on the North’s military. They also would not confirm reports that the North had shifted more troops to the land border with the South. The border zone between the two Koreas is one of the most heavily militarized in the world. North and South Korea are still technically at war: The 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, rather than a full peace treaty. A much-studied facet of each defense white paper is the South’s description of North Korea. “North Korea is our enemy,” a defense official said Thursday, repeating the language of the new report. Enemy is a stronger term than the previous white paper used. In 1994, a North Korean official notoriously vowed to turn Seoul into a “sea of fire,” and the white paper the following year reflected the strained relations, describing the North as the “main enemy” of the South. That description was eventually downgraded to “serious threat” in 2004, under President Roh Moo-hyun. But in 2008, the conservative government of President Lee Myung-bak ratcheted it back up, using the words “direct and serious threat.” Since then, North Korea has conducted a second nuclear test; allegedly torpedoed a South Korean warship, killing 46 sailors; revealed a new and sophisticated uranium-enrichment facility; and struck a South Korean island, killing four persons, during an artillery battle. “Not using the expression ‘main enemy’ does not mean that we have softened our stance,” Deputy Defense Minister Chang Kwang-il told reporters. The conservative daily Chosun Ilbo said in a commentary on Thursday: “There is no way to avoid calling such a country an enemy. “The main opposition Democratic Party said labeling North Korea as an enemy would ‘drive a wedge’ into inter-Korean relations. Surely it must realize that North Korea is the one driving a wedge between the two sides by threatening the South with a nuclear attack.” On Thursday, Russia urged both Koreas to return to six-nation talks in order to reduce tension on the Korean Peninsula. “It is imperative to stop military activity,” Deputy Foreign Minister Alexei Borodavkin said, according to the Reuters news service, “and move from muscle flexing to dialogue between the North and South.” Mr. Borodavkin’s comments appeared to reinforceChina’s call for a return to talksafter the Nov. 23 barrage on Yeonpyeong Island. It also followed Mr. Lee’sstatements on Wednesdaythat he would be willing to endorse restarting the multiparty talks.

South Korea has not responded to the disclosure on Sunday of a new nuclear enrichment plant.

SEOUL, South Korea — Revelations of a uranium enrichment facility inNorth Koreafound the South Korean government and nuclear experts grappling for a response. “If this information is true, then this is a serious problem,” an official with the South’s Defense Ministry said on Monday, referring to the facility that was seen this month by an American nuclear scientist on a visit to North Korea. The defense official and other government officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of the issue and because the South Korean government was still formulating its position. “Our ministry is watching and monitoring North Korea’s nuclear activity,” said the defense official, adding that he was not permitted to say whether the military had known that the facility existed before the American scientist, Siegfried S. Hecker, disclosed  it. The revelationswere first reported Sundayin The New York Times. Several other senior government officials said Monday that they were surprised by the news of the highly sophisticated plant, which Mr. Hecker describedin a reportas an “industrial-scale uranium enrichment facility with 2,000 centrifuges.” One senior official in Seoul said the government had long had “suspicions” of the North’s continuing enrichment program. Although the new revelations were “a serious matter,” he said, he characterized the mood in his ministry as “not that panicked.” Wi Sung-lac, Seoul’s chief negotiator on nuclear issues, met Monday morning in Seoul with Stephen W. Bosworth, the United States special envoy for North Korea, who called the new North Korean enrichment effort “disappointing” and “not helpful.” On Monday afternoon, Mr. Wi traveled to Beijing to meet with his Chinese counterparts, a trip that had been previously scheduled. China is North Korea’s only major ally. On Monday, South Korea’s foreign minister, Kim Sung-hwan, played down the new facility, saying, “It’s nothing new.” But some political analysts in Seoul were alarmed at an apparent lapse in intelligence gathering by United States and South Korean agencies. “These are supposedly the best and brightest guys and they’re making such stupid mistakes,” said Moon Chung-in, a professor of political science at Yonsei University in Seoul. “Washington and Seoul always fall into the pattern of looking at North Korea from their own negative perceptions. They are blinded by their own stereotypes, prejudices and inertia.” Mr. Moon said the North had publicly announced that it would continue with its nuclear efforts if international sanctions against the government remained in place. On April 15 of last year, the North Korean Foreign Ministry said it would “proceed with our own LWR fuel cycle,” referring to the production of low-enriched uranium for use in a civilian light-water reactor. North Korean atomic officialsrecently told Mr. Heckerand a former American diplomat, Jack Pritchard, that they had begun construction of such a reactor. “Intelligence agencies in South Korea and the U.S. haven’t even been paying attention to official announcements from North Korea,” Mr. Moon said. “There was no reaction from Washington and Seoul. They just said it was North Korea bluffing or for propaganda purposes.” But now that the North has unveiled its new enrichment facility, Mr. Moon said, “North Korea has proved they can deliver.” Analysts, including Kim Seoc-woo, a proliferation expert and director of the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul, said the North Koreans would have had to have help. Traders using smuggling channels might have brought banned nuclear equipment into the North using an overland route — starting from Iran, then through Afghanistan and perhaps Pakistan, then into China and on to North Korea, the analysts said.

SEOUL, South Korea — The ailing North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, may soon visit China, the North’s last remaining  patron, to seek help as his government faces its greatest crisis since the catastrophic famine in the mid-1990s, according to South Korean officials and news reports. Reports of Mr. Kim’s “imminent trip” to China, in what would be his fifth visit to Beijing since he took power in 1994, have been circulating here for months. In an unusual prediction, the office of President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea said this week that there was “a high level of possibility” that Mr. Kim would visit China. The likelihood of Mr. Kim’s trip increased after a recent exchange of high-level delegations between the North and China, during which Mr. Kim was formally invited to Beijing. The predictions also stem from the fact that analysts say Mr. Kim is facing both external and internal pressures that are forcing him to reach out to the one remaining, if reluctant, source of aid: China. “His biggest goal on a trip to China will be securing help to overcome the North’s economic crisis,” said Choi Myeong-hae, a visiting professor at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security in Seoul. As payback for such aid,North Koreamight be expected to return to the six-nation talks, a forum that China presides over and that is aimed at persuading the North to give up itsnuclear weaponsprogram in exchange for economic and diplomatic rewards. Experts on North Korea say that Mr. Kim, a reclusive yet shrewd survivalist, might try to obtain Chinese investment or aid, which could weaken the impact of United Nations sanctions, while continuing to hold on to his nuclear program, which is his last bargaining chip and a source of national pride he can hold up before his people, who are said to be facing growing food shortages. Mr. Kim, 68, is also thought to be in declining health, after a stroke in 2008. He is now undergoing dialysis every two weeks, according to Nam Sung-wook, director of the Institute for National Security and Strategy, a research organization affiliated with South Korea’s main spy agency. Mr. Kim, who inherited power after the death of his father, Kim Il-sung, in 1994, is hurrying to groom his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, 27, as his heir, officials in south Korea say. To justify another dynastic succession, he is proposing to build a “strong and prosperous nation” by 2012. But recent seizures of cargo out of North Korea demonstrate  that the United Nations embargo, tightened after the North’s nuclear test in May 2009, is squeezing the North’s ability to export weapons, a major source of hard currency.Food aidfrom South Korea has dried up under President Lee, a conservative who wants to see North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons program. The government’s disastrous currency revaluation in November, meant to fight inflation and curb free markets, has also deepened food shortages. Mr. Kim, who has kept his people in isolation and fearful of prison gulags, has outlived previous predictions of the collapse of his government, even after an estimated two million North Koreans died of famine in the mid-1990s. But the North Korea of today is not the North Korea of the 1990s. South Korean DVDs and outside news are smuggled in from China. The currency revaluation elicited highly unusual outbursts of public anger. North Korea “is facing several domestic problems that in isolation would each be manageable but together could threaten regime survival,” Daniel Pinkston, an International Crisis Group researcher, said in arecent report. But he also cautioned that for now, the state security apparatus and the barriers to collective action made a “revolution from below” impossible. Meanwhile, the government seems to be gambling that it can tighten political control by cracking down on private markets, a conduit of capitalist influence, while trying to improve food supplies and the economy with Chinese help. “Markets will be removed in the future, by reducing their numbers step by step, while continuously expanding the planned supply through state-run commercial networks,” Ri Ki-song, a professor at the North’s state-run Academy of Social Sciences, said in an interview in Pyongyang, North Korea’s capital, that was broadcast on APTN on Thursday. B. R. Myers, a North Korea expert at Dongseo University in South Korea, said at a forum in Seoul this week that the North’s currency reform and crackdown on the markets might not be as unpopular as reported. It is likely that they did not affect most North Koreans, he said, except those relatively few who had amassed a private fortune through black markets. Mr. Kim’s plea for aid will be strengthened by the implicit threat of his country’s economic collapse, which would be a nightmare for China’s leaders, who can easily envision millions of starving refugees flooding over the border. “Buttressing up the Kim Jong-il regime for stability in the North is as important as denuclearizing it,” said Mr. Choi, the analyst. Chinese state media reported on Thursday that China and North Korea planned to start building twohydroelectricdams this year on the Yalu River, which serves as their border. The dams will cost about $161 million and generate 308 million kilowatt hours of electricity for North Korea and the northeastern Chinese province of Jilin. China is also considering investments to build bridges and renovate roads and railways in North Korea to tap its rich natural resources and use its ports, according to South Korean news reports and analysts. For its part, South Korea wants China and the United States to focus more on dismantling the North’s nuclear weapons. A nuclear North Korea increases investors’ risks in South Korea, leaves the South more dependent on the benevolence of the United States’ nuclear umbrella and makes a unified Korea a more distant dream, officials here say. At the same time, if the North does not get any help from China or South Korea, “it might launch a desperate provocation against the South,” Kim Young-soo, a North Korea expert at Sogang University in Seoul, said at a recent seminar. Fears of such a situation increased last week, when a South Korean Navy ship sank in a mysterious explosion in waters disputed by North Korea, possibly after being hit by a North Korean torpedo or mine, the defense minister, Kim Tae-young, told South Korea’s National Assembly on Friday.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreasaid Friday that its differences with the United States had been diminished during the visit this week of President Obama’s special envoy, but that it needed more talks before deciding whether to return to six-nation nuclear disarmament talks. “Through businesslike and candid talks, both sides deepened mutual understandings, narrowed differences in their respective views and identified not a small number of things in common,” an unidentified spokesman for North Korea’s Foreign Ministry said, according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency. “Both sides agreed to continue to cooperate to narrow the remaining differences.” Stephen W. Bosworth, Mr. Obama’s envoy, released a similar assessment of his three-day visit to North Korea, which ended Thursday. He said that North Korea and the United States shared an understanding of the necessity but not the timing of reconvening six-nation talks and carrying outa 2005 agreementto dismantle the North’snuclear weaponsprograms. “We identified some common understandings on the need for and a role of six-party talks and the importance of implementation of the 2005 joint statement,” Mr. Bosworth said at a news conference in Seoul on Thursday. But, he said, “it remains to be seen when and how” North Korea will return to talks. He said that the talks — the Obama administration’s first senior-level negotiations with the North Korean government — were “exploratory” and that it would take more consultation with the other nations inthe six-nation talksbefore it would be clear when the North would rejoin the discussions. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton told reporters in Washington that “for a preliminary meeting it was quite positive.” Although the North has indicated that it may return to the six-nation meetings, it has also insisted on a new track of bilateral talks with the United States to negotiate the normalization of diplomatic relations and a peace treaty to replace the truce that ended the Korean War in 1953. The North said it would not give up its nuclear arms until it believed that the United States was no longer “hostile.” Mr. Bosworth said that once the six-nation talks reconvened and gained “a significant traction” on denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, the United States and its allies would be ready to discuss the incentives offered in the 2005 agreement: economic aid, security guarantees, normalized relations with Washington and a peace treaty. After a stop in South Korea, Mr. Bosworth was heading to China, Japan and Russia to brief officials. Those four countries have been the other participants in the six-nation talks. Mr. Bosworth updated South Korean officials on the talks with North Korea’s first vice foreign minister, Kang Sok-ju, who is considered the main architect of his country’s nuclear policy and one of the closest aides to North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-il. Mr. Bosworth also met with the North’s chief negotiator, Kim Kye-gwan. Mr. Bosworth’s visit was meant to help Washington decide whether it should maintain sanctions or switch to engagement to prod North Korea toward giving up its nuclear weapons. American and South Korean officials remain unconvinced that the North would give up its nuclear weapons, fearing that it wants to use a new round of talks to escape sanctions and obtain aid. North Korea has struggled to maintain control of its economy, most recently by revaluing its currency. In the past year, North Korea has tested ballistic missiles and a long-range rocket, detonated a nuclear device and reactivated its plutonium production plant. It has also declared that it began enriching uranium for possible use in nuclear weapons. But recently, it has begun to reach out. On Thursday, in a rare admission of a domestic problem and a sign of new openness, North Korea accepted a South Korean offer to send itswine flumedication, South Korean officials said. A day earlier, the North acknowledged nine cases of H1N1 influenza in Pyongyang, the capital, and Sinuiju.

SEOUL — The North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, told the visiting prime minister of China that his government was ready to return to six-nation talks on itsnuclear weaponsprogram if it sees progress in bilateral talks with the United States, state-run media inNorth Koreaand China said Tuesday. Meanwhile, North Korea was “close to completing” the restoration of its main nuclear facilities in Yongbyon, the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported Tuesday, quoting an unidentified government source. The government in Seoul could not immediately confirm the Yonhap report. In an angry reaction to United Nations sanctions earlier this year, North Korea said it would restore the Yongbyon complex, previously mothballed under a deal with Washington. The complex, 62 miles north of the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, is the North’s only known source of weapons-grade plutonium. Along with its uranium enrichment program, the Yongbyon facility also serves as North Korea’s main negotiating card as the regime has begun reaching out to the United States for a new round of one-on-one talks. Mr. Kim’s commitment to the Chinese prime minister, Wen Jiabao, who is on a highly publicized trip to Pyongyang, reverses North Korea’s previous stance that the six-nation talks were “dead,” and also clears a major hurdle for the United States to engage North Korea. But Mr. Kim’s insistence on bilateral talks with Washington reiterates the North’s longstanding strategy of handling its nuclear dispute largely as a matter between it and the United States. Washington said recently it was open to direct talks with the North to coax it back to six-party talks, which include the two Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the United States. “We expressed our readiness to hold multilateral talks, depending on the outcome” of talks with the United States, said the North’s state-run news agency, K.C.N.A., in a dispatch about a Kim-Wen meeting on Monday. “The six-party talks are also included in the multilateral talks.” “The hostile relations between the D.P.R.K. and the United States should be converted into peaceful ties through the bilateral talks without fail,” the news agency also quoted Mr. Kim as saying, using the acronym for the North’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. “Our efforts to attain the goal of denuclearizing the peninsula remain unchanged.” Mr. Kim’s comments were also reported Tuesday by Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency. While North Korea had issued similar statements before, Mr. Kim’s latest comments provided the clearest sign yet that Pyongyang was eager to return to the negotiating table after months of rising tensions over its nuclear and missile tests earlier this year. But that process, analysts say, is bound to be complicated. North Korea has repeatedly used negotiations over ending its nuclear weapons program as a way of extracting aid and diplomatic concessions from the outside world. Mr. Wen arrived in Pyongyang on Sunday to celebrate the 60th anniversary of formal ties between the two communist allies. But his trip has also been cast as a mission to persuade North Korea to return to the disarmament talks. China offered an unspecified amount of aid to the North during Mr. Wen’s trip, according to K.C.N.A.

Despite the relief over the freeing of two U.S. journalists, the Clinton mission has long-term implications.

Amidst the widespread relief that the two American journalists have avoided the brutal fate meted out to them by a North Korean court, it may seem captious to consider the long-term implications. The impulse to save two young women from 12 years of hard labor  in a North Korean gulag is powerful. Yet now that this goal has been achieved, we need to balance the emotions of the moment against the precedent for the future. It is inherent in hostage situations that potentially heartbreaking human conditions are used to overwhelm policy judgments. Therein, in fact, lies the bargaining strength of the hostage-taker. On the other hand, at any given moment, several million Americans reside or travel abroad. How are they best protected? Is the lesson of this episode that any ruthless group or government can demand a symbolic meeting with a prominent American by seizing hostages or threatening inhuman treatment for prisoners in their hands? If it should be said that North Korea is a special case because of its nuclear capability, does that create new incentives for proliferation? Context matters. It is less than six months since Pyongyang conducted a nuclear test and resumed the production of weapons-grade plutonium in violation of an agreement signed at the six-power conference in Beijing in February 2007. North Korea refused a visit by the new U.S. envoy charged with discussing its proliferation efforts. Pyongyang has rejected various U.N. Security Council resolutions to desist from these activities and to return to the six-party talks. A visit by a former president, who is married to the secretary of state, will enable Kim Jong-il to convey to North Korea, and perhaps to other countries, that his country is being accepted into the international community  —  the precise opposite of what the U.S. secretary of state has defined as the goal of U.S. policy until Pyongyang abandons its nuclear weapons program. Already speculation is rife that the Clinton visit inaugurates the prospect of a change of course of American policy and of a bilateral U.S.-North Korea solution. But two-party talks outside the six-party framework never made any sense. North Korean nuclear weapons threaten its neighbors more than the United States. The other members of the six-party talks are needed to help enforce any agreement that may be made or to sustain sanctions on the way to it. These countries should not be made to feel that the United States uses them as pawns for its global designs. To be sure, the administration has disavowed any intentions for separate, two-power talks. But the other parties will be tempted to hedge against the prospect that these assurances may be modified. That feeling is likely to be particularly strong in Japan, where a national election campaign is taking place and which feels it has secured inadequate support on behalf of Japanese abducted by North Korea. The pains the administration has taken to cast the Clinton mission as a private, humanitarian visit  and the restrained manner in which it was conducted demonstrate an awareness of those risks. Though the distinction between private and public is likely to prove elusive when it concerns a former president and spouse of the secretary of state, the administration is still in a position to achieve a beneficent long-term outcome. The root cause of our decade-old controversy with Pyongyang is that there is no middle ground between North Korea being a nuclear weapons state and a non-nuclear weapons state. At the end of a negotiation, North Korea will either destroy its nuclear arsenal, or it will become a de facto nuclear state. So far, it has used the negotiating forums available to it in a skillful campaign of procrastination, alternating leaps in technological progress with negotiating phases to consolidate it. We seem to be approaching such a consolidating phase now. North Korea may return to its well-established tactic of diverting us with the prospect of imminent breakthroughs. This is exactly what happened after the last Korean nuclear weapons test in 2006. Pyongyang undoubtedly will continue to seek to achieve de facto acceptance as a nuclear weapons state by endlessly protracted diplomacy. The benign atmosphere by which it culminated its latest blackmail must not tempt us or our partners into bypaths that confuse atmosphere with substance. Any outcome other than the elimination of the North Korean nuclear military capability in a fixed time period is a blow to non-proliferation prospects worldwide and to peace and stability globally.

WASHINGTON — Former PresidentBill ClintonleftNorth Koreaon Wednesday morning after a dramatic 20-hour visit, in which he won the freedom of two American journalists, opened a diplomatic channel to North Korea’s reclusive government and dined with the North’s ailing leader, Kim Jong-il. Mr. Clinton departed from Pyongyang, the capital, around 8:30 a.m. local time, along with the journalists,Laura Ling, 32, andEuna Lee, 36, on a private jet bound for Los Angeles, according to a statement from the former president’s office. The North Korean government, which in June sentenced the women to12 years of hard laborfor illegally entering North Korean territory, announced hours earlier that it had pardoned the women after Mr. Clinton apologized to Mr. Kim for their actions, according to the North Korean state media. President Obama contacted the families of the women on Tuesday evening, according to administration officials, but the White House said it would withhold public comment until the former president landed on American soil. Mr. Clinton’s mission to Pyongyang was the most visible by an American in nearly a decade. It came at a time when the United States’ relationship with North Korea had become especially chilled, after North Korea’stest of its second nuclear devicein May and a series of missile launchings. It ended a harrowing ordeal for the two women, who werestopped on March 17by soldiers near North Korea’s border with China while researching a report about women and human trafficking. They faced years of imprisonment in the gulaglike confines of a North Korean prison camp. And it catapulted Mr. Clinton back on to the global stage, on behalf of a president who defeated his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, in a bitter primary campaign last year, and who later asked her to be his secretary of state. Mrs. Clinton was deeply involved in the case, too. She proposed sending various people to Pyongyang — including Mr. Clinton’s vice president, Al Gore — to lobby for the release of the women, before Mr. Clinton emerged as the preferred choice of the North Koreans, people briefed on the talks said. About 10 days ago, these people said, Mr. Gore, who co-foundedCurrent TV, the San Francisco-based media company that employs Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee, called Mr. Clinton to ask him to undertake the trip. Mr. Clinton agreed, as long as the Obama administration did not object. The riveting tableau of a former president, jetting into a diplomatic crisis while his wife wasembarking on a tour of Africain her role as the nation’s chief diplomat, underscored the unique and enduring role of the Clintons, even in the Obama era. The trip came just two weeks after North Korea issueda harsh personal attackon Mrs. Clinton, in response to comments she made comparing its nuclear test and missile launchings to the behavior of an attention-seeking teenager. The North Korean Foreign Ministry objected  to her “vulgar remarks” and called her “a funny lady” who was neither intelligent nor diplomatic. “Sometimes she looks like a primary-school girl and sometimes a pensioner going shopping,” a spokesman said. The episode evidently did not stop consideration of sending her husband as an envoy. But the initiative was cloaked in secrecy and came after weeks of back-channel talks between the United States and North Korea through its United Nations mission. In addition to Mr. Gore, the White House’s list of potential candidates included Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico. North Korea signaled its desire to have Mr. Clinton act as a special envoy in conversations with Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee, who relayed that message to their families in the middle of July, according to a senior administration official. The message was passed to Mr. Gore, who contacted the White House, which then explored whether such a mission would be successful. Mr. Obama did not speak directly with Mr. Clinton before the mission. But his national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, contacted the former president to sound him out. The senior official said the administration did “due diligence” with the North Koreans to ensure that if Mr. Clinton went, he would return with the journalists. He also denied that Mr. Clinton apologized as a condition of obtaining the pardons from the government. As president, Mr. Clinton had sent Mr. Kim a letter of condolence on the death of his father, Kim Il-sung, according to a former official. For Mr. Kim, the former official said, freeing the women was a “reciprocal humanitarian gesture.” Mr. Kim is believed to have suffered a stroke last year. American officials said they thought his declining health had set off a succession struggle, complicating the Obama administration’s dealings with the North. The families of the American journalists issued a statement saying they were “overjoyed” by news of the pardon and thanked Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton. “We especially want to thank President Bill Clinton for taking on such an arduous mission and Vice President Al Gore for his tireless efforts to bring Laura and Euna home,” the statement said. Current TVsaid in a statement that it too was “overjoyed” and that the hearts of its employees went out to Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee for “persevering through this horrible experience.” The Obama administration said Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee were in good health. Administration officials said Mr. Clinton went to North Korea as a private citizen, did not carry a message from Mr. Obama for Mr. Kim and had the authority to negotiate only for the women’s release. “This was 100 percent about the journalists,” said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter. “We knew Kim Jong-il would probably seek a meeting with Clinton. But that’s not what this visit was about.” Still, North Korea, clearly seeing a propaganda opportunity at home and a rare chance for a measure of favorable publicity abroad, welcomed Mr. Clinton with the fanfare of a state visit. It broadcast a group portrait, as well as photos of Mr. Kim gesturing and talking to Mr. Clinton; of the former president accepting flowers from a North Korean girl; and of Mr. Clinton, seated across a negotiating table from Mr. Kim, each flanked by their aides. Among those greeting Mr. Clinton at the airport was Kim Kye-gwan, North Korea’s chief nuclear negotiator. Among those accompanying Mr. Clinton was David Straub, a former director of the Korea desk at the State Department, who had held talks with the North Koreans through what is known as the “New York connection.” Also on hand was John Podesta, an informal adviser to the Obama administration who served as Mr. Clinton’s chief of staff in the final years of his presidency, when the former president yearned to travel to North Korea to clinch a deal that would have curbed its nuclear program. That visit never happened — partly because the White House concluded that a deal was not assured — and President George W. Bush put the brakes on direct talks with North Korea, setting the stage for eight years of largely fruitless efforts to stop the North’s nuclear ambitions. Given Mr. Clinton’s stature and his long interest in the North Korean nuclear issue, experts said it was likely that his discussions in North Korea ranged well beyond obtaining the release of Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee. “It would be someplace between surprising and shocking if there wasn’t some substantive discussion between the former president, who is deeply knowledgeable about the nuclear issue, and Kim Jong-il,” said Robert L. Gallucci, who negotiated with North Korea in the Clinton administration. Mr. Clinton has sought to find the right place in the Obama era, eager to play a role without stepping on the toes of the new president or certainly of his secretary of state. The last time the two spoke, said the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, was in March, when Mr. Obama invited Mr. Clinton to a ceremony in Washington for signing legislation expanding the AmeriCorps program created by Mr. Clinton. In interviews last spring, Mr. Clinton said that he would be happy to do anything Mr. Obama asked him to do, but that “I try to stay out of their way.” Mr. Clinton’s  mission may be less of an issue for Mr. Obama than for Mrs. Clinton. The same day he landed in North Korea, she arrived in Kenya, kicking off an 11-day journey through Africa — a visit now largely eclipsed by her husband’s travels.

Kim Jong-il has pancreatic cancer and the illness is life-threatening, the South Korean broadcaster YTN said.
==::==
2009-07-13T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — The North Korean leaderKim Jong-il, who suffered a stroke last August, was also found to have “life-threatening” pancreatic cancer around the same time, a South Korean cable television network reported on Monday. The network, YTN, a cable news channel, quoted unidentified Chinese and South Korean intelligence sources for the report, which was made by YTN’s Beijing-based correspondent. YTN did not explain how the sources obtained such medical information about Mr. Kim fromNorth Korea, an isolated, nuclear-armed state that historically has kept details of its leader’s health a closely guarded secret. But if the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is true, Mr. Kim may not have much longer to live. Pancreatic cancer is one of the most difficult cancers to detect early, it spreads rapidly and the fatality rate is high. The World Health Organization says fewer than 5 percent of patients with pancreatic cancer live longer than five years. Although Mr. Kim began making occasional public appearances a few months after he mysteriously disappeared last August, photographs of him and television images recently carried by the North Korean media showed him limping and frail. Mr. Kim’s loss of weight, in particular, has elevated speculation about the severity and nature of what is wrong with him. His health and who is going to succeed him at the top of one of the world’s most secretive states are most intensely monitored issues. Mr. Kim looked gaunt during a public appearance last Wednesday at a memorial for his father, the founder of North Korea, Kim Il-sung. Mr. Kim inherited power after his father died in 1994 at the age of 82. American intelligence officials said last fall that Mr. Kim was seriously ill, although the exact nature of his illnesses has been a matter of speculation. A French neurosurgeon who has treated Mr. Kim said the North Korean leader did have a stroke last August. In December, the doctor, François-Xavier Roux, told Le Figaro, the French daily newspaper: “Kim Jong-il suffered a stroke but did not undergo an operation. He is now better.” Mr. Kim’s health is a topic of intense international interest, in large part because world leaders and governments are unclear about who would succeed him. North Korea is one of the world’s most unpredictable nations, and any transfer of power will focus new attention on the security of its nuclear arsenal. In May, North Korea tested its second nuclear device in a move that shocked and angered the international community. Even China, the North’s closest ally, condemned the test. Mr. Kim has three known sons, and in recent months there have been widespread reports — many of them thinly sourced — that the youngest son, Kim Jong-un, has been designated the heir apparent.

Seven missiles were fired into the sea between North Korea and Japan, flouting a United Nations resolution.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreafired three missiles into the sea between the Communist state and Japan on Saturday morning, the South Korean military announced. News reports here called them ballistic Scud or Rodong missiles. The South Korean military declined to clarify what types of missiles the North had fired. But if the reports were correct, the North Korean tests on Saturday were bound to raise tensions between the North and its neighbors. After anuclear testby North Korea on May 25, the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution that, among other things, barred it from testing ballistic missiles. A South Korean military official, speaking on condition of anonymity citing government policy, said the missiles launched Saturday were believed to have flown no more than 300 miles, indicating that they might be the North’s Scud-type missiles. The South Korean news agency Yonhap quoted military sources as saying the missiles were either Scud or Rodong missiles. A statement from the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said the military was “fully ready to counter any North Korean threats and provocations based on strong South Korea-U.S. combined defense posture.” The latest launchings came on July 4. The North has a record of timing missile tests to coincide with Independence Day in the United States, as a way of highlighting the provocative gestures. Pyongyang fired off a barrage of missiles, including a long-range Taepodong-2, on the Fourth of July in 2006. The Taepodong launching was a failure, with the projectile falling into the sea less than a minute after blastoff. The United States is currently is leading international efforts to enforce the United Nations resolution, which calls for a global embargo on arms trade with the North. North Korea has responded by declaring that it would conduct more missile and nuclear tests. Speculation has been running high in South Korea and Japan that the North might launch more missiles in coming days. It had warned shipping to stay away from its east coast through July 10. North Korea launched arocket on April 4, in what was widely considered another test of Taepodong-2, designed to be an intercontinental missile capable of carrying a warhead as far as the West Coast of the United States. Attention has been focused on whether the North would attempt to launch another intercontinental missile, as it has said it would in the wake of the United Nations  sanctions. But so far, spy satellites have not detected any signs of preparing a Taepodong launching, South Korean officials said in recent days. The United States chief of naval operations, Adm. Gary Roughead, said Saturday that the American military was ready for any North Korean missile tests. "Our ships and forces here are prepared for the tracking of the missiles and observing the activities that are going on,” he said in Tokyo after meeting with Japanese military officials in Tokyo, according to The Associated Press.

The new sanctions adopted by the United Nations Security Council must be enforced if there is any chance of deterring more dangerous actions by North Korea.
==::==
2009-06-17T00:00:00Z
==::==
North Korea is developing a frightening track record of making good on its threats. True to its word, in recent weeks it has conducted a second nuclear test  and several missile tests. It also may have resumed making fuel for nuclear weapons. And the threats keep coming. Over the weekend, the North vowed to make more nuclear weapons and to take “resolute military actions” against efforts to isolate it. Whether new sanctions adopted unanimously by the United Nations Security Council can deter even more dangerous actions is anyone’s guess. We know there is no chance if they are not implemented. The resolution leaves a lot of room for governments to avoid enforcement should they choose. The resolution bars North Korea from selling weapons (ballistic missiles and parts are exports) or buying them. It authorizes states — but does not require them — to inspect cargo vessels and airplanes suspected of carrying North Korean weapons or nuclear technology. The North has sold missiles to Iran and other unsavory customers and a nuclear reactor to Syria. It also calls on — but does not require — states and financial institutions to stop providing banking services, loans and credits that could support its nuclear or missile programs. That could have the biggest impact, if countries and banks heed the call. It is encouraging that China, North Korea’s top supplier of food and fuel, and Russia were heavily involved in drafting the resolution. China’s ambassador endorsed what he called the international community’s “firm opposition” to the North’s nuclear ambitions. But talk is cheap. China and Russia exposed their continued ambivalence by blocking efforts to make certain elements of the new sanctions mandatory. China also insisted on carving out an exception so that it could continue selling small arms to the North. No one has more influence with the North Koreans than China, but it has repeatedly blocked tough sanctions for fear of destabilizing the North and unleashing a flood of refugees. The Obama administration is doing its part. It has said that it would confront any ship suspected of carrying banned items and is exploring new ways to squeeze the North financially. After all that has happened, administration officials are understandably skeptical that any negotiated deal is possible. And they are right to insist that they will not keep paying the North to live up to commitments it has repeatedly made and then reneged on. But they are also right to leave the door open to negotiations. After meeting on Tuesday with South Korea’s president, Lee Myung-bak, President Obama called a nuclear-armed North Korea a “grave threat.” He also said that the North had “another path available”  and that it could still come in from the diplomatic cold if it returns to the bargaining table and abandons its nuclear ambitions. This is a very dangerous time. As the pressure mounts, no one can be sure how North Korea’s erratic leaders will respond. But it would be even more dangerous to allow the North to churn out more nuclear weapons or sell them to the highest bidder. The United States and the other powers, starting with China, must use all of their influence to head off the worst.

North Korea confirmed that it had detained two American journalists on charges of “illegally intruding” into the Communist state through its border with China.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreaconfirmed Saturday that it had detained two American journalists on charges of “illegally intruding” into the North through its border with China. The journalists, Laura Ling, a Chinese-American, and Euna Lee, a Korean-American, both working for Current TV, were on a reporting trip along the border when they were detained by North Korean border guards, according to human rights activists and a South Korean news report. Their colleague, Mitch Koss, and their Chinese guide were reported to have been detained by Chinese border guards. “A competent organ is now investigating the case,” the North’s official news agency, KCNA, said. The terse dispatch, which gave no details, was the first confirmation by North Korea of the arrests. On Friday, Washington said that Secretary of StateHillary Rodham Clintonwas trying to free the two journalists, who had traveled to the border area to report on North Korean refugees in China, according to Chun Ki-won, a Christian clergyman in Seoul who helped arrange their trip. Their arrest complicates Washington’s already thorny relations with the North, including an increase in tensions over North Korea’s plan to launch a satellite between April 4 and April 8. American officials say they believe that the rocket launching is a cover for testing ballistic missile technology. Also Saturday, the North told international aviation authorities that it would close two international air routes through its airspace from April 4 to April 8 for the satellite launching, according to the Japanese and South Korean governments. It remains unclear under what circumstances Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee were detained. The Chosun Ilbo, South Korea’s leading newspaper, reported Saturday that the American television crew appeared to have crossed the river border — either intentionally or not — while trying to get a closer shot of North Korea. Citing Chinese sources on the border, the newspaper reported that the three American journalists and their Chinese guide, an ethnic Korean, crossed the border around sunrise on Tuesday near Tumen, a Chinese border city. The Tumen River, which forms the border, is only 20 or 30 yards wide in the area, according to human rights advocates who have visited there. Much of the river bed is dry, and the shallow water is frozen at this time of the year. It is difficult to tell where the border lies, and North Korean guards often stay hidden in bunkerlike guard posts, they said. The two men in the group, Mr. Koss and the guide, who was not identified, freed themselves from the armed North Korean soldiers and ran back to China, while the two women were overpowered, The Chosun Ilbo reported. Current TV, based in San Francisco, was founded by former Vice President Al Gore.

Kim Jong-il, North Korea’s leader, is probably hospitalized but still capable of making decisions, Japan’s prime minister, Taro Aso, said Tuesday.

TOKYO —Kim Jong-il,North Korea’s leader, is probably hospitalized but still capable of making decisions, Japan’s prime minister, Taro Aso, said Tuesday. Citing intelligence reports, Mr. Aso said in a parliamentary session that “there are reports he has been hospitalized.” “However, it’s not believed that he is completely incapable of making decisions,” Mr. Aso said, answering an opposition lawmaker’s question during an exchange on foreign affairs and defense. If Mr. Kim, 66, had been incapable of decision-making, Japanese and other intelligence officials believe, “we would be seeing different developments” in North Korea, Mr. Aso said. In a separate assessment of Mr. Kim’s health on Tuesday, the intelligence chief for South Korea’s conservative government said in a closed parliamentary session in Seoul that the leader appeared to be recovering quickly. According to Yonhap News, Kim Sung-ho, the director of the National Intelligence Service, told lawmakers that the North Korean leader had recovered enough to start performing his daily duties. Previous reports said he might have suffered a stroke. That report came the same day that North Korea threatened to reduce South Korea to “debris” if it did not stop its “smear” campaign. The government was apparently enraged that Seoul had done  nothing to stop human rights advocates from dropping anti-Kim leaflets from balloons flying over North Korean territory. Although Mr. Aso did not provide further details about the North Korean leader’s condition, his comments were a rare instance of a national leader speculating  publicly about Mr. Kim’s health. They did not seem to relate to any domestic political considerations, but Japanese leaders were upset this month when the Bush administration removed North Korea from the State Department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism. Tokyo has long wanted to use the promise of removal from the terrorism list as leverage to force North Korea to be more forthcoming about the fate of Japanese citizens who were abducted many years ago. The prospect that the six-nation talks, in which Japan is participating, on dismantling the North’s nuclear program could be completed without resolving the abduction issue is anathema to the Japanese. Mr. Kim’s health, long a topic of intense speculation outside North Korea, has been a  focus of intelligence officials since he failed to attend a celebration last month of the 60th anniversary of the founding of North Korea. American and other officials said that he had possibly suffered a stroke and was under the care of doctors in the capital, Pyongyang, raising fears about instability in the North, a nuclear power. North Korea has denied that Mr. Kim is ill. According to North Korean media,  Mr. Kim has made public appearances since his absence from last month’s celebration. But experts have raised doubts about the date of one photograph supposedly showing Mr. Kim.

The decisions were disclosed in an internal agency memo that was obtained by The Associated Press. The memo was a strong indication that North Korea was making good on its pledge to return to an international agreement in which it had promised to dismantle its nuclear weapons program in exchange for political concessions and energy aid. The change of heart came on Sunday after the United States removed the country from its list of states sponsoring terrorism.

North Korea fired short-range missiles off the country’s western coast, South Korean media reported.
==::==
2008-10-09T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL, South Korea  —North Koreafired short-range missiles off the country’s western coast this week, , South Korean media reported Wednesday, a move that comes amid tensions raised by its efforts to reassemble part of its nuclear facilities. Several news organizations reported the launches, but offered differing details. South Korea’s Yonhap news agency, quoting an unnamed government source, reported that the .North  had launched two missiles on Tuesday toward international waters between the North and China. Chosun Ilbo, a mass-circulation daily in Seoul, also quoting an unnamed government source, reported that North Korea launched  an unknown number of missiles from a naval base in Chodo, an island about 60 miles southwest of the North Korea capital, Pyongyang. It said the missiles were either KN-01 land-to-sea missiles or Styx ship-to-ship missiles. North Korea has deployed more missiles around Chodo  and declared it a no-go zone, meaning that it may launch more missiles to mark the Oct. 10 anniversary of the ruling Workers Party of Korea, the newspaper  quoted the government source as saying. But another mass-circulation newspaper, JoongAng Ilbo, said  two missiles were fired  Tuesday and said they were air-to-ship missiles launched from an IL-28 North Korean bomber. The South Korean military would not confirm the launches. A spokesman at the office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, asking for  anonymity under normal ground rules, said,  “We cannot confirm these reports because it’s an intelligence matter.” South Korea usually dismisses short-range missile tests by the North as part of routine military exercises. But analysts say that the North tests  missiles when it wants to escalate tensions to strengthen  its bargaining position. In March, North Korea test-fired a barrage of short-range missiles off its western coast, while threatening to slow down work to  disable its nuclear weapons facilities in Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang, work it had agreed to as part of a hard-won international agreement. North Korea stopped disabling the Yongbyon complex in August, angry that it had not been removed  from the United States’  list of state sponsors of terrorism. Last month, North Korea began reassembling the facilities used to produce weapons-grade plutonium from spent nuclear fuel rods. Christopher R. Hill, the senior  American envoy for North Korea, visited Pyongyang last week to try to find a way to salvage the disarmament deal. North Korea conducted its only  nuclear test in October 2006.  It is unknown whether the North has the technology to arm its missiles with nuclear warheads. North Korea has a large arsenal of missiles, including ballistic weapons  whose range includes  all of South Korea and Japan. Missile experts say that the North is also developing a long-range  missile series, called Taepodong,  that would be  able  to reach parts of North America.

That a stream of the New York Philharmonic’s performance made its way out over the Internet was nothing short of amazing.
==::==
2008-02-27T00:00:00Z
==::==
It would of course have been fascinating to attend theNew York Philharmonic’s concert on Tuesday night at the East Pyongyang Grand Theater in North Korea. Daniel J. Wakin, a  reporter for The New York Times, was there to cover this breakthrough event, the first performance by an American orchestra in that totalitarian country. Yet, in a way, the potential (if any) of this concert to thaw the icy relations between North Korea and the United States may have come through even better in the live relay that I watched at home on my desktop computer. The performance was streamed at 4 a.m. Eastern time on  Tuesday on thePBS-WNET Web site.  (A broadcast in conventional fashion was scheduled for Tuesday night at 8 in the New York area as part of the “Great Performances” series on WNET, and showings on other PBS stations will follow later in the week.) In negotiating with the North Korean government for this 48-hour stop on its Asian tour, the New York Philharmonic and its music director, Lorin Maazel, insisted that the concert in Pyongyang be broadcast within the country and beyond. It is hard to know how many North Koreans were actually able to see it. Still, that the performance made its way over the Internet was nothing short of amazing. For music lovers in the New York area who have grown familiar with the Philharmonic players, it was affecting to see them take their places onstage in the recently renovated  modern   concert hall in Pyongyang, as the audience applauded warmly. There were immediate close-up images of the assistant concertmaster, Michelle Kim; she  left South Korea for America as a child with her parents, who had fled the North during the war. But the knowing cameras also singled out Glenn Dicterow, the affable veteran concertmaster; Carter Brey, the elegant principal cellist; and the young Joseph Pereira, a versatile percussionist, as they assumed their roles as cultural ambassadors to this isolated country where the news media are strenuously controlled. Extremes of political opinion have been expressed about the Philharmonic’s decision to accept this invitation. I was touched by the comments of one Philharmonic player, quoted in The Associated Press, who felt bad that the orchestra would be playing for an audience of Pyongyang elites, while so many North Koreans lack the basics of food, heat and electricity. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, an accomplished pianist, brought some cool diplomatic perspective to the concert in a statement last week. “I don’t think we should get carried away with what listening to Dvorak is going to do in North Korea,” she said. Still, to judge from the streamed version, Lorin Maazel and the Philharmonic did very well by Dvorak on Tuesday night, giving a full-bodied, vibrantly characterized performance of the “New World” Symphony. Mr. Maazel switched easily between the roles of towering maestro and gracious host. Introducing the pieces in English (relying on an  interpreter), he tossed in a few welcoming phrases in Korean that drew appreciative laughter and applause from the audience. What the Philharmonic played was just as important as how it played. Here Mr. Maazel’s tame choices represented missed opportunities. Presenting the “New World” Symphony made a point, of course. As Mr. Maazel explained, the piece, commissioned by the Philharmonic, was a Czech composer’s symphonic ode to America. And there were valid reasons to include Gershwin’s sassy, jazzy “American in Paris.” Someday, Mr. Maazel said, maybe someone will compose a piece called “Americans in Pyongyang.” If only he had chosen to include even one short work by a living American composer, perhaps an Asian-American composer. Because the orchestra stuck  to staples, the classical music art form came off as unthreatening. New music, by definition, is destabilizing. To have a composer taking part in the program would have been a reminder that the heritage is living, breathing and unpredictable. Instead Mr. Maazel began with Wagner’s prelude to Act III of “Lohengrin.” Wagner’s career rather undermines the case for the humanizing powers of music. Here was a nasty man who somehow wrote sublime and stirring operas. Still, the concert was historic. And the image of a major American orchestra as a sleek machine under the control of an imposing conductor was nicely countered by the second encore: the overture to Bernstein’s “Candide,” which, as Mr. Maazel explained, was played by the musicians without a conductor as a tribute to its beloved composer. After the final encore, an arrangement of a wistful Korean folk song, “Arirang,” the audience stood, cheered and even waved farewell to the musicians. Many of the players visibly choked up, and waved back. It’s a start.

The comments made last week by President Bush’s special envoy on North Korean human rights criticized the current United States diplomatic approach of North Korea.

WASHINGTON — Secretary of StateCondoleezza Rice, in a rare public rebuke, has upbraided a White House envoy who criticized United States diplomacy towardNorth Koreathat is aimed at coaxing the North Koreans to give up their nuclear weapons. Ms. Rice said  the official, Jay Lefkowitz, President Bush’s special envoy on North Korean human rights, was not speaking for the administration when he told an audience at the American Enterprise Institute last week that the United States “should consider a new approach to North Korea” because the current approach was unlikely to resolve the issue before  the end of Mr. Bush’s term   in a year. Speaking to reporters aboard her flight to Berlin on Monday, Ms. Rice sharply disagreed, and said Mr. Lefkowitz should stick to human rights and leave the  talks over the North’s nuclear policy to her, Mr. Bush and the other nations involved: Russia, China, Japan and South Korea. “He’s the human rights envoy,” Ms. Rice said. “That’s what he knows. That’s what he does. He doesn’t work on the six-party talks. He doesn’t know what’s going on in the six-party talks and he certainly has no say in what American policy will be in the six-party talks.” Mr. Lefkowitz, reached at his office in New York,  said he and Ms. Rice spoke on Friday about the disagreement, and he described their conversation as “very amicable, substantive and useful.” “I’m going to have a great deal more to say about elevating the issue of human rights in North Korea, which is clearly a priority for the president and Congress,” he said. The dispute comes at a time when nuclear talks have stalled, with North Korea missing a year-end deadline to disclose all of its nuclear programs. A debate within the administration has fractured along familiar lines, with  hard-line national security hawks in Vice President Dick Cheney’s office and at the White House arguing for a more confrontational approach with the North. On the other side, Mr.  Bush’s lead North Korea nuclear negotiator, Christopher R. Hill, backed by Ms. Rice, has argued that the United States should continue a more restrained approach, one that was widely credited with bringing about an agreement last year intended to eventually lead to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Ms. Rice said that Mr. Bush had “spoken as to what our policy is in the six-party talks.” “I know where the president stands,” she added, “and I know where I stand, and those are the people who speak for American policy.”

SEOUL, Aug. 14 — Severe flooding inNorth Koreahas left hundreds dead or missing and inflicted widespread damage, North Korean officials acknowledged today, raising fears of worsening food shortages in an already impoverished land. The rare admission of problems by the reclusive Communist government — and the speed with which it invited United Nations relief agencies like the World Food Program to assess the situation — suggested the gravity of the situation in North Korea, where many people already live on the edge of starvation. “We are very concerned that this flooding is very serious,” said Paul Risley, Asia spokesman with the World Food Program, whose officials were traveling at Pyongyang’s invitation to the affected areas. “They have made a preliminary request for assistance.” South Korea said it is also considering offering emergency aid to its neighbor, although it has not received a formal request from the North. Reports of the flooding in North Korea, a country that is chronically prone to floods and drought, came two weeks before President Roh Moo Hyun of South Korea was scheduled to meet North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Il, in Pyongyang from Aug. 28 to 30. With extensive parts of its farmland destroyed now, economic aid will loom larger in the summit meeting, the first in seven years. “The material damage so far is estimated to be very big,” said the North’s state-run Korean Central News Agency. The agency said the heavy rains, which started a week ago, were known to have destroyed at least 800 public buildings, 540 bridges, 70 sections of railroads and 1,100 vehicles, pumps and electric motors. Hardest hit were four agriculturally productive provinces in central and southern North Korea and the capital, Pyongyang, where some low-lying residential zones were inundated, according to a dispatch by Chosun Sinbo, a pro-North Korean newspaper in Japan. North Korea said “tens of thousands of hectares of farmland” were inundated, buried under silt and washed away. “That will have an effect on this year’s harvest and the ability of farmers to replant those areas,” Mr. Risley said. “This will certainly have an effect on the food available this fall.” Even in a good year, North Korea has a grains shortfall of about one million tons, according to the World Food Program. The damage this month was feared to be greater than that reported in the flooding of July last year, according to Mr. Risley and Suh Sung Woo, a senior official at South Korea’s Unification Ministry who spoke to reporters in Seoul today. “The one really interesting phenomenon now is how quickly North Korea both announced the extent of damages and how quickly they requested assistance from U.N. agencies,” a Western diplomat in Asia familiar with North Korea’s food crisis said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “The government is more open about the situation,” the diplomat said. “This is either an indication that this is a very serious crisis or it is an indication that the government is acting in a more cooperative manner.” During the flooding last year, weeks passed before North Korea acknowledged flood damage and requested outside help. At the time, Chosun Sinbo quoted North Korean sources as saying that the flooding had left 549 people dead and 295 missing, with 28,747 homes destroyed. This time, North Korean officials have told the International Red Cross that 200 people are dead or missing across the country, the agency’s acting delegation head, Terje Lysholm, told The Associated Press from Pyongyang. The Red Cross was able to visit 14 counties, where it counted 2,500 homeless families and is distributing kits of necessities such as blankets, kitchen sets and water purification tablets. Flooding has been a recurring curse in mountainous North Korea, where many hills have been deforested as North Koreans try to create more arable land and collect firewood.

Pyongyang has demanded the return of up to $25 million frozen in a Macau bank before it continues negotiations.

BEIJING, March 22  — Talks aimed at dismantlingNorth Korea’s nuclear weapons program stalled here today  over the failure to release up to $25 million frozen in a Macau bank that Pyongyang has demanded be returned before it continues disarmament negotiations. The United States assistant secretary of state, Christopher Hill, said that Chinese officials were working to transfer the money from the Macau bank,  Banco Delta Asia, but that this had been delayed because of unexpected “technical banking issues”. China called a halt to the talks late today  without a date being agreed for the next round of negotiations, although Mr. Hill said a Feb. 13 agreement that the North would shut down its Yongbyon reactor by April 13 in return for economic aid remained on track. He declined to comment on the specific reasons why it was proving difficult to release the money  from accounts linked to North Korea that have been frozen since Washington in September 2005 accused the small, family-owned bank of money-laundering and distributing counterfeit American  currency on behalf of the North. Banco Delta Asia has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Over four days of six-nation talks in the Chinese capital this week, North Korean negotiators refused to discuss arms control until the money was  transferred to an account controlled by the North in the Bank of China, a state-owned Chinese lender. “To me, it highlights the degree of the D.P.R.K.’s isolation that it sometimes proves difficult to return money to them even when everybody wants to see the money returned to them,” Mr. Hill said, referring to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the North’s official name. “It really was an issue of how do you move bank accounts,” he said. Mr. Hill said he expected the money  to be transferred within days, but there was some confusion late today  about how North Korea would get the money and how much of the $25 million it was entitled to have. The president of the Bank of China, Li Lihui, said today  that the bank had not been asked to handle the transaction. “I can tell you that up until now, we were not asked to deal with this business,” he told reporters in Hong Kong today,  The Associated Press reported. Earlier, China’s official Xinhua news agency quoted Russia’s top envoy at the six-party talks, Alexander Losyukov, as saying that the Bank of China had refused to accept the money. But  China’s chief negotiator at the talks, Wu Dawei, who has been closely involved in efforts to transfer the money,  said the Bank of China had concerns about accepting the money and “not all the concerns have been assuaged.” In a statement on its Web site, the Macau monetary authority said it would handle transferring all money  at  Banco Delta Asia according to instructions from the account holders. Still, banking industry analysts said it was unlikely that all account holders would agree to have their money transferred to an account they could not control at  the Bank of China. They also questioned whether the Chinese bank would be comfortable accepting money without question from a bank that the United States has accused of criminal activity. Accounts controlled by about 50 North Korean banks, trading companies and individuals were frozen in Banco Delta Asia along with $7 million in the account of Daedong Credit Bank, North Korea’s only foreign-managed bank. Daedong Credit Bank has said it can prove that the sources of the money  frozen in its account are  legitimate, and it has been lobbying officials in Macau and Washington to have the money released. Colin McAskill, a British businessman in the process of buying the Macau bank, was unavailable for comment. After an 18-month investigation, the United States  Treasury Department on March 14 formally issued a ruling that bans American banks from dealing with Banco Delta Asia, effectively isolating it from the American  financial system. The Treasury Department’s attack on Banco Delta Asia has angered Pyongyang and become a major sticking point in efforts to disarm the North. In answer to a question about whether these moves against the bank had undermined international efforts to disarm North Korea, Mr. Hill said, “This is a long-term question.” He added, “Our country has absolutely no choice but to be vigorous in protection of our financial system.” Soon after the United States  moved against the bank in September 2005, North Korea began boycotting the six-nation talks, and its state-controlled news media carried a host of reports about  demonstrations  in North Korea against the talks. The  North conducted tests of improved ballistic missiles last summer, and then on Oct. 9, test-detonated a nuclear weapon for the first time. Both steps drew angry protests from neighboring nations and the United States. The regime in Pyongyang agreed to return to the talks late last year only after the United States agreed to hold separate negotiations on Banco Delta Asia. As a result of those financial talks, Washington announced on Monday that the frozen funds would be returned to the North by way of the Bank of China, after Pyongyang pledged that the money would be used for humanitarian purposes and education. While only American banks have been formally banned from dealing with Banco Delta Asia, Washington also actively discouraged many international lenders from doing business with the bank, according to financial experts and American officials. Because of those efforts, an informal financial embargo was tightening around the impoverished North, effectively isolating it further from the international banking system. Analysts have said there was no doubt that this led isolation led to economic pain for the North. But the regime focused most of its attention on the frozen funds in Banco Delta Asia, Japanese diplomats following the talks said, even though the sum involved  was fairly small, even for a poor nation like North Korea. The diplomats speculated that some of the frozen money may be the personal funds of top officials in Pyongyang. A senior Japanese diplomat in Beijing this week, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the North’s determination to recover the frozen funds could be a sign that financial sanctions were limiting the leadership’s access to foreign currency, which is used to reward loyal officials with expensive gifts and luxury goods.

To the Editor: Re “The Lesson of North Korea” (editorial, Feb. 14): It appears that the price has been set as to what the rest of the world, including the United States, will pay to get you to give up your nuclear weapons. The only question that remains is whether the price will go up for a government in the Middle East or South America or somewhere else  where a government decides to blackmail the world. The lesson of the deal with North Korea is that nuclear blackmail is a practical means for a tyrant to provide for the people under his thumb. Bill Decker San Diego, Feb. 14, 2007  To the Editor: Instead of celebrating the recent nuclear disarmament agreement between the United States and North Korea, I have reasons to be skeptical: ¶North Korea has broken such agreements in the past, so what makes us think that it will keep the agreement this time? ¶How will the dismantling of its nuclear weapons program be enforced, and how effective will the enforcement be? ¶What will the inspectors be allowed to do? ¶Does North Korea consider this to be only a temporary agreement or a permanent one? I have a bad feeling that the United States and North Korea will be back squabbling before long. Kenneth L. Zimmerman Huntington Beach, Calif. Feb. 14, 2007  To the Editor: Re “Private Talks Held in Berlin Spurred Sides to Reach Deal” (news article, Feb. 14): It’s refreshing to read that diplomacy has deterred North Korea’s aspirations for nuclear weapons. Now we must hope that the same can occur in Iran. It’s obvious from the disaster in Iraq that diplomacy trumps warfare. Sarah Newman Los Angeles, Feb. 14, 2007  To the Editor: You write (“The Lesson of North Korea,” editorial, Feb. 14), “We hope that Mr. Bush learns the most basic lesson of this week’s deal: sometimes you really do have to talk to your enemies, even if you have to grit your teeth.” Speaking of gritting one’s teeth, I could figuratively hear your editorial teeth grind as you said something almost nice about the president. You seem frightened that he might yet “salvage” his presidency. How glad I am to be a political independent and to be pleased when a president, whoever he may be, succeeds. That means the country succeeds. You seem almost angry. Such is the price of making partisanship the first priority.   Ronald M.

BEIJING — An American who had been detained for six months inNorth Koreaarrived in Beijing on Saturday following his release a day earlier, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said. The American, Jun Young-su, who lives in Southern California, arrived in Beijing on Saturday with an American envoy who had visited the reclusive country this past week, said U.S. Embassy spokesman Richard Buangan. Mr. Jun was freed because a visiting American official had “expressed regret at the incident,” The Associated Press reported on Friday. Mr. Jun entered North Korea on a valid business visa but was detained for inappropriate or illegal religious activity, according to Fridaynews media reports in South Koreathat cited the North’s state news service. The United States official who was said to have expressed regret, Robert R. King, the special envoy for North Korean human rights issues, was leading an American delegation that was trying to verify food supply surveys by international charities. After arriving in Beijing on Saturday, Mr. King said that Mr. Jun had been released and would be reunited with his family within a day or two. "While we were there," Mr King said, "our team had three and a half days of very serious and thoughtful talks with the foreign ministry." Mr. King said they discussed several issues, but "did not negotiate or agree to any provision of food assistance,"apparently trying to stop speculation of a deal to free Mr. Jun, who did not appear before reporters "That is an issue that will have to be made in Washington," Mr. King said. After a trip to North Korea in late April, formerPresident Jimmy Carter said he was disappointedthat he did not win the release of Mr. Jun on humanitarian grounds. Mr. Carter made the trip as a member of theElders, an independent group of world leaders established by Nelson Mandela. Mr. Carter said the Swedish ambassador in Pyongyang had visited Mr. Jun four times and reported that he was being treated well. Because the United States does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea, its interests are sometimes represented there by Sweden. At the time of Mr. Carter’s trip, Mr. Jun’s familyissued an open letter to North Koreato appeal for the release of “our loving father and husband.” The letter said that Mr. Jun, who is said to be in his 60s, had medical issues. “We strongly doubt that our father’s health can withstand the stress of a trial or further detainment,” family members wrote. “Therefore, we beseech his release as an act of humanitarianism that your nation can bestow upon him and our family.”

SEOUL, South Korea — Despite a relatively good autumn harvest,North Korearemains in dire need offood aid, especially for its youngest children, pregnant women and the elderly, according to twoUnited Nationsagencies. In anew joint report, the World Food Program and the Food and Agriculture Organization said that North Korea, even after substantial imports, would have a shortfall in staple crops — mostly rice, grains and soybeans — of more than half a million tons. The 2010 harvest was 3 percent higher than last year’s, the agencies said, despite an unusually harsh winter and alternating drought and flood conditions over the summer. But even in the best of years, North Korea is unable to feed itself. Government food distribution provides only half the necessary daily calories, the report said. People are thus left to fend for themselves with small hillside plots and kitchen gardens, and by buying food or bartering for it on the black market. Officials have estimated that the food aid program for North Korea is underfinanced by 80 percent and that nearly half the country’s children are malnourished. “I saw a lot of children already losing the battle against malnutrition,” said Josette Sheeran, executive director of the World Food Program, after a visit to North Korea this month. “Their bodies and minds are stunted, and so we really feel the need there.” On another matter affecting North Korea, the South Korean government on Wednesday rejected a North Korean request for talks about restarting cross-border tours to the jointly operated Mount Kumgang resort in the North, also known as Diamond Mountain. The tours, which were suspended by the South in 2008, annually brought millions of dollars of hard currency to the North Korean government. South Korea suspended the resort tours after a South Korean woman was shot and killed there by a North Korean guard, apparently when the woman wandered into a restricted zone. Angered by the suspension of the tours, North Korea responded by seizing several buildings owned by South Korea. The South has demanded a fuller investigation of the shooting as well as more safeguards for its tourists before tours can begin again. In their joint report on food shortages, the United Nations agencies pointed out that agriculture was “the main contributor to the national income” in the North, although its percentage of the gross domestic product has declined in the past decade to 21 percent from 30 percent. A lack of foreign currency and credit, made worse by international sanctions against the government, prevented significant imports of fertilizer and pesticides as well as tires and spare parts for farm trucks and tractors. Inremarks before the Group of 20 summitmeeting in Seoul last week, the secretary general of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, said he had “very serious concerns about the humanitarian situation” in North Korea, “especially for the very young children.” Mr. Ban said the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, had pledged to him that the South would provide humanitarian assistance to the North’s children. North Korea, as a condition for allowing further reunions between families separated by the Korean War, asked the South last month for 500,000 tons of rice and 300,000 tons of fertilizer. The request was denied. The South Korean government did send smallshipments of rice and instant noodlesto the North last month, part of an $8.5 million aid package agreed on earlier by the two countries. Analysts and donors have expressed concern that the food aid from the South will be diverted to the North’s political elite and the military.

A State Department worker, Stephen Jin-Woo Kim, is accused of disclosing classified information to Fox News.

WASHINGTON — A federal grand jury in Washington has indicted a State Department analyst suspected of  disclosing top-secret information aboutNorth Koreato Fox News, the third time the Obama administration has filed criminal charges accusing people of leaks to the news media. The indictment, dated Aug. 19 and unsealed on Friday, named Stephen Jin-Woo Kim, 43, of McLean, Va., a specialist in nuclear proliferation who worked as a contractor for the State Department. Mr. Kim, who has worked as a high-level foreign affairs analyst for a decade for various federal agencies, is accused of disclosing the information in June 2009 and of lying to the F.B.I. in September 2009. Mr. Kim, an American citizen, pleaded not guilty on Friday in Federal District Court before Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly and was released on $100,000 bond. A person familiar with the investigation said it involved a Fox News report on North Korea’s likely reaction to a United Nations Security Council resolution, which was then pending, that condemned its nuclear and ballistic missile tests. Fox News said at the time that it was “withholding some details about the sources and methods by which American intelligence agencies learned of the North’s plans.” The charges are part of a crackdown on disclosures of classified information to the news media under President Obama. A former contract linguist for the F.B.I. was sentenced in May to 20 months in prison for disclosing secret documents to a blogger, and a veteran National Security Agency official isawaiting trial on charges of sharing classified information with a reporterfor The Baltimore Sun. In addition, the Justice Department is seeking to question a reporter for The New York Times, James Risen, about his sources for a book about the C.I.A. that describes a program devised to disruptIran’s nuclear weaponsprogram. News media and civil liberties advocates have criticized the prosecutions, noting that Mr. Obama came into office pledging to insist on openness about government operations. Administration officials have said there is no contradiction between the transparency policy and aggressively punishing those who leak secrets. David S. Kris, the assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s national security division, said in a statement that “the willful disclosure of classified information to those not entitled to it is a serious crime.” But Abbe D. Lowell, a lawyer for Mr. Kim, denounced the charges as an attempt to criminalize “the type of government-media exchanges that happen hundreds of times a day in Washington.” He said the charges would “destroy the career” of Mr. Kim, whom he called “a loyal civil servant and brilliant foreign policy analyst.”

As the lowest-ranked of the 32 nations in the field, North Korea faces an imposing challenge. Yet no country enters the tournament with a bigger reputation for doing the unexpected.
==::==
2010-06-02T00:00:00Z
==::==
JOHANNESBURG —North Korea’s soccer team arrived Tuesday at the World Cup, where it will be supported by cheerleaders recruited from China, led by a forward born in Japan and prohibited at home from receiving free television coverage provided by fellow competitor and political rival South Korea. There is much intrigue surrounding the mostly unknown team from North Korea. One of the world’s most closed nations will open slightly to participate in the world’s biggest sporting event, even as it is being accused by South Korea ofsinking one of its warshipsin March and killing 46 sailors. As the lowest-ranked of the 32 nations in the field, North Korea faces an imposing challenge to become one of two teams advancing from the so-called Group of Death, which also includes Brazil, a five-time champion; Portugal, a 2006 semifinalist; and the Ivory Coast, an African power led by one of the world’s best forwards, Didier Drogba. Yet no country enters the tournament, which runs from June 11 to July 11, with a bigger reputation for doing the unexpected. North Korea’s last appearance in the World Cup — in 1966 — resulted in one of soccer’s greatest feats,a shocking 1-0 victory over Italy, whose humbled players were reportedly pelted with rotten fruit upon returning home in disgrace. “We have a great desire for success in the tournament,” North Korea’s coach, Kim Jong-hun, said in a brief statement Tuesday. As expected, Kim did not refer to increasing tensions along the 38th parallel. In sporting terms, North and South Korea have a complicated relationship that long predates the sinking of the naval vessel, the Cheonan. Last week, South Korea’s captain, Park Ji-sung, told The Guardian of London, “Maybe we can get closer to North Korea through the World Cup.” Athletes from the two Koreas marched together in the opening ceremony at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Yet North Korea did not even attempt to qualify for the 2002 World Cup, which was jointly hosted by South Korea and Japan. It also ignored an offer by FIFA, soccer’s world governing body, to host a match or two in that tournament. During qualification for this World Cup, a 2008 match with South Korea, scheduled for Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, was moved instead to Shanghai. South Korea had insisted on bringing its own fans, raising its national flag and playing its national anthem, to which the North objected. After losing a 2009 qualifying match by 1-0 to South Korea in Seoul, the North Koreans complained of biased refereeing and tainted food, saying the game “turned into a theater of plot-breeding and swindling.” South Korea’s refusal to beam free World Cup television broadcasts across the demilitarized zone, which it did as a humanitarian gesture in 2006, might not have a dramatic impact. Kim Jong-il, the North Korean leader, would probably not allow any matches to be shown live anyway, considering that the team could be humiliated or someone could hold up a sign of protest against the regime, said Brian Myers, a professor of international studies and an expert on North Korean propaganda at Dongseo University in Pusan, South Korea. If North Korea somehow defeated or tied mighty Brazil, tightly edited snippets of the match — obtained perhaps from China or pirated — would be shown a day or two later, Myers said. Defeats might receive no mention in the state-controlled news media. “I can’t remember reading about North Korea losing a match,” Myers said in a telephone interview. “Occasionally, they show a couple minutes of soccer matches around the world. They might show one of the enemy — like the U.S. or Japan — losing.” Unlike the former East Germany and Soviet Union, which intended athletic achievement as a sign of communist superiority, sports in North Korea serve to burnish nationalism and enhance the cult of personality of Kim Jong-il, said Michael Breen, a British journalist who lives in Seoul and has authored a biography of the leader. That seemed evident when goalkeeper Ri Myong-guk said it was his duty to “safeguard the gates to the fatherland,” and the star forward Jong Tae-se said, “If Kim Jong-il is pleased, I will be honored.” Jong is one of two ethnic Koreans on the North’s roster who were born in Japan. He is a top forward in Japan’s professional league and is nicknamed the People’s Rooney for a stocky build and goal-scoring propensity that remind some of the English star Wayne Rooney. There have been conflicting reports of Jong’s heritage. Some news accounts say he was born to South Korean parents and later renounced his South Korean citizenship. But Jong told reporters recently that his mother is North Korean, his father was born in Japan and that he himself attended Pyongyang-supported schools there. Upon leaving his Japanese club team  to begin World Cup preparations, Jong told reporters in Tokyo that his North Korean teammates were curious about his cellphone, and had passed it among one another. He also vowed to score in each match, adding, “We want to produce results that will stun the world.” Sven-Goran Eriksson, the Ivory Coast coach, cautioned that opponents better be prepared for the relentless, defensively robust North Koreans, saying: “Physically they are better than anyone because they have been in training camp for six months. They are organized, running all the time.” Because so few North Koreans have the money or the permission to leave the country for the World Cup, the nation’s sports committee has recruited about 1,000 Chinese fans as surrogate cheerleaders, including actors and musicians, according to Xinhua, China’s state-run news agency. If North Korea does stun the world, it will not be the first time. At the 1966 World Cup, its army-based team shocked Italy on a lone goal by Pak Do-ik, who later was called the Dentist for inflicting so much hurt on the favored Italians. North Korea then blew a three-goal lead and lost, 5-3, to Portugal in the quarterfinals. Rumors spread that the Koreans had run out of gas after cavorting in Middlesbrough, England, where the Italian match was held, and were later killed or sent to re-education camps for their decadent behavior. But a British filmmaker named Daniel Gordon found the truth to be otherwise in a 2002 documentary about that North Korean team called“The Game of Their Lives.”Players received decent apartments and increased rations for their startling upset, Gordon said in a telephone interview. “It’s possible some prominent players got caught up in factional purges, but I’m not convinced it had to do with 1966,” said Gordon, who has been to North Korea more than 20 times. “As far as them going through bars and cavorting with women, there aren’t any half-Korean children running around Middlesbrough about age 40. That behavior didn’t happen.”

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreahas arrested and possibly executed its top financial official as it struggles to contain chaos set off by its botched attempt to halt inflation through a radical currency revaluation, according to news reports Thursday in South Korea. The fate of the official, Pak Nam-gi, the ruling Workers’ Party’s finance and planning department chief, who is said to have spearheaded the currency reform, became a focal point of speculation when he did not  appear at any official functions reported in the North Korean news media for the past two months. But the reclusive nature of the North Korean government has made it nearly impossible to verify reports about high-ranking officials. If the reports about the arrest and execution are true, though, they suggest that the ailing North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, considers the public discontent in the aftermath of the currency reform a serious challenge to his grip on power. Mr. Pak “was executed at a firing range in Pyongyang on the trumped-up charges of being an antirevolutionary element as public sentiments worsened over the failure of the currency reform,” reported the South Korean news agency Yonhap, quoting unnamed sources in North Korea. In late November, North Koreasuddenly told its people that it would introduce new banknotes, ordering them to turn in their old bills for new ones at a rate of 100 to 1. It also put a cap on how much old money they could swap for the new currency. The shock measure was meant to arrest runaway inflation and crack down on illegal markets in the socialist state. But it only aggravated the food crisis, creating shortages and soaring prices, and reportedly led to isolated but highly unusual outbursts of protest in the totalitarian state. South Korea said it could not confirm the reports about Mr. Pak’s execution. Mr. Kim often keeps personnel reshuffles secret, and party officials who have disappeared from official functions and been reported to be dead in the South Korean news media have often resurfaced years later in new jobs. “It’s unusual that Mr. Pak has not been seen in public for two months, and there is speculation about his fate,” said Lee Jong-joo, a spokeswoman at the Unification Ministry in Seoul. “But we don’t have any information about whether he was sacked, arrested or executed by firing squad.” Until Jan. 9, Mr. Pak’s name appeared regularly in the list of officials the North Korean news media reported as accompanying Mr. Kim on inspection tours of factories, farms and military units. Names on the list offer guidance about who is in favor in the North Korean hierarchy. The failed currency reform threatened Mr. Kim’s main policy goal, which was to create at least an impression that its moribund economy would revive by 2012. That is when he is expected to announce one of his three known sons — most likely, according to observers, his youngest son, Jung-un — as his official heir. “The North Korean authorities have tried to reverse their currency policy failure, but they don’t seem to know how,” said Lee Seung-yong, an official at Good Friends, a relief group based in Seoul that collects information from sources within the North. “We have reports that the food situation is getting worse and some people are dying of hunger.” As its state-run stores failed to provide enough food, North Korea recently reversed itself andbegan turning a blind eye to private marketsto resuscitate food supplies. But the markets remain empty, Mr. Lee said. With prices expected to continue to soar, those who have goods are not returning to the markets, he said. Reports that Mr. Pak was executed or arrested were also carried byDaily NKand Free North Korea Radio, both Web sites based in Seoul that rely on informants from North Korea. But others cast doubt. Park Sang-hak, a North Korean defector and head of a Seoul-based advocacy group, Fighters for Free North Korea, said that his informants in North Korea had heard “rumors” that Mr. Pak was either executed or sent to a prison camp. “But so far, our sources haven’t found anyone who says he actually saw this execution,” Mr. Park said. Ha Tae-keung, head of Open Radio for North Korea, which also gathers news from North Korea, agreed. “If they executed him to quell public anger, he must have been executed in public and thousands must have been mobilized to watch it,” Mr. Ha said. North Korea publicly executed Seo Gwan-hee, a party secretary in charge of agriculture, on spying charges in 1997 when a famine decimated the population, according to defectors. But Mr. Kim also banishes confidants embroiled in corruption or policy blunders to remote areas as warnings, only to reinstate them years later, Mr. Park said.

Three provocative new books about North Korea parse the slivers of light that escape this enigmatic and often baffling place.

Computers are rare inNorth Korea, and the Internet, for most of its citizens, is little more than a whispered rumor. It’s probable, in fact, that only one person surfs the Web in North Korea without someone monitoring every click:Kim Jong-il, that authoritarian regime’s supreme leader. When he’s online, and not lurking on sites devoted to his obsessions (movies, fancy food, young women,nuclear weapons), Mr. Kim  must sometimes see what his country looks like, to the rest of the world, in those haunting satellite photographs of the Far East at night. You’ve probably seen them. The countries near North Korea — Japan, South Korea, China — are ablaze with splotches and pinpricks of light, with beaming civilization. But North Korea, a country nearly the size of England, home to some 23 million people, is a black hole, an ocean of dark. Barbara Demick, a foreign correspondent for The Los Angeles Times, begins her excellent new book, “Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea,” by poring over these satellite images. She’s shocked by them, and moved. “North Korea is not an undeveloped country,” she observes. “It is a country that has fallen out of the developed world.” “Nothing to Envy” is one of three provocative new books about North Korea, from writers who are committed to parsing the slivers of light that escape this enigmatic and often baffling place. The others are “The Hidden People of North Korea,” by Ralph Hassig and Kongdan Oh, and “The Cleanest Race,” by B. R. Myers. North Korea is not an easy country to observe. Few foreign journalists are allowed in, and then only with official minders and strictly limited itineraries.  To get a sense of how ordinary citizens live, writers must rely primarily on the accounts of defectors. If we have trouble seeing North Koreans plainly, they cannot see us at all. Telephone use is severely restricted. (Even the telephone book is a classified document marked “secret.”)  Postal service is spotty.  There is essentially no e-mail. Television and radios receive only approved channels. The country’s citizens are force-fed a steady, numbing diet of state propaganda devoted to sustaining the personality cult of Kim Jong-il and savaging all things American. How are North Koreans taught to think about us? Well, here’s one indication. Children learn a ditty called “Shoot the Yankee Bastards” in music class. One verse goes: Our enemies are the American bastardsWho are trying to take over our beautiful fatherland.With guns that I make with my own handsI will shoot them. BANG, BANG, BANG. (The truly poignant words here are “with my own hands.”) Ms. Demick’s book is a lovely work of narrative nonfiction, one that follows the lives of six ordinary North Koreans, including a female doctor, a pair of star-crossed lovers, a factory worker and an orphan. It’s a book that offers extensive evidence of the author’s deep knowledge of this country while keeping its sights firmly on individual stories and human details. The people Ms. Demick observes lived, before their defections, in northeastern North Korea,  far from the country’s tidy, Potemkin village-like capital, Pyongyang. The existences she describes sound brutal: there is often not enough food; citizens work long days  that can be followed by hours of ideological training at night;  spying on one’s neighbors is a national pastime;  a nonpatriotic comment, especially an anti-Kim Jong-il wisecrack, can have you sent to a gulag for life, if not executed. Ms. Demick writes especially well about the difficult lives of those who do manage to defect. Not only are they bewildered by life outside of North Korea, and have to be taught to do things like use an A.T.M.,  but they also live with deep shame and guilt, knowing that relatives left behind have probably been sent to prison as punishment for their escape. Mr. Hassig and Ms. Oh’s book, “The Hidden People of North Korea: Everyday Life in the Hermit Kingdom,” is wonkier than Ms. Demick’s and less reader-friendly, but it covers more ground. The authors are married (Ms. Oh’s parents were North Koreans who fled to South Korea); he is an independent consultant specializing in North Korean affairs, and she is on the research staff of the Institute for Defense Analysis in Alexandria, Va. Their book is based on more than 200 interviews with defectors, and it paints a picture of a restless populace, increasingly dubious about the official propaganda.  “It would be a gross exaggeration to say that the people support Kim Jong-il,” they write. “Rather, it does not occur to them to oppose him.”  North Koreans are too busy trying to survive, and too preoccupied by the tensions of the supposed mighty conflict with America, to be able to think about much else. Mr. Hassig and Ms. Oh’s portrait of  Mr. Kim’s  hyper-sybaritic lifestyle is detailed and devastating. He may look like a man of the people, they write, with his tan slacks, zippered jackets and stout build that make him resemble Jackie Gleason as Ralph Kramden in “The Honeymooners.” But they chronicle his obsession with the latest electronics,  the “pleasure teams” of girls he keeps handy,  the Bordeaux wine he has flown in. While many of his people starve, they write, Mr. Kim “is such a connoisseur that, according to his former chef, every grain of rice destined for his dinner table is inspected for quality and shape.” The authors are aware that Mr. Kim’s  anti-American paranoia isn’t baseless. The leader of a different country in George W. Bush’s “axis of evil,” they note, was captured and later hanged. Mr. Hassig and Ms. Oh’s book concludes with pointed policy recommendations. They think it is nearly hopeless to negotiate with Mr. Kim  and suspect that “nonproliferation agreements with the regime will simply encourage it to brandish new threats in the future.” Instead of fixating on Korea’s weapons, the authors suggest bypassing the regime and reaching out to North Korea’s people, who sorely need humanitarian aid and “a new way of thinking about their government and their society.” Mr. Myers, the author of “The Cleanest Race: How North Koreans See Themselves — and Why It Matters,” is a contributing editor to The Atlantic  and famously the author of“A Reader’s Manifesto,”a controversial and humorless broadside against the literary writers (Annie Proulx and Cormac McCarthy among them) whom he finds pretentious or obscure. Mr. Myers directs the international studies department at Dongseo University in South Korea. He is a crisp, pushy writer who is at his best when on the attack, and his often counterintuitive new book attempts a psychological profile of Kim Jong-il and his regime. Mr. Myers has pored through mountains of North Korean propaganda — from nightly news reports and newspapers to war movies, comics, wall posters and dictionaries   —  and he argues that the West is misreading the country’s core beliefs. He explains that North Korea’s dominant worldview is “far removed” from the Communism, Confucianism and official “show-window” ideologies that Westerners analyze. Instead, he argues, this worldview “can be summarized in a single sentence: The Korean people are too pure-blooded, and therefore too virtuous, to survive in this evil world without a great parental leader.”  His North Korea is guided by a “paranoid, race-based nationalism.” Mr. Myers’s arguments are too wily and complex to be neatly summarized here, but he includes a fascinating analysis of Mr. Kim’s  depiction as an essentially — and crucially — feminine military leader.  His regime presents North Korea more as a motherland than a fatherland,  Mr. Myers writes, and he cites official slogans about Mr. Kim  like “We Cannot Live Away From His Breast.”  The lack of a patriarchal authority figure, he says, “may also have helped the regime preserve stability by depriving people of a target to rebel against.” Mr. Myers also cautions against the idea that the West can persuade North Korea to shed its nuclear weapons.  Mr. Kim  “cannotdisarm and hope to stay in power,” he writes.  At the same time, he notes, “blue jeans will not bring downthisdictatorship.”  Any signs of serious unrest, he observes, will encourage Mr. Kim  to raise the level of   the tension with the West, and possibly do something rash with his nuclear arsenal. Kim Jong-il reportedly suffered a stroke in 2008 and has looked frail during his recent, and increasingly rare, public appearances. While the world speculates about his successor, almost certainly to be one of his sons,  one of the lessons of these books is not to remove our eyes from the blinkered lives of the average North Korean. “The Kim regime essentially holds its people hostage,” Mr. Hassig and Ms. Oh write, and they are dismayed to note that “the United States is much more interested in the hostage taker’s weapons of mass destruction than in the fate of his hostages.” North Koreans sometimes joke, Ms. Demick writes in “Nothing to Envy,” that they live like “frogs in the well.” It’s a line that sends you back to study those satellite images, and to contemplate those who dwell under Mr. Kim’s inky moral darkness.

Kim Jong-il’s bright smiles were not returned by Bill Clinton. Yet the grinning North Korean and stony-faced American were no doubt savoring their moment of mutual relevance.

WASHINGTON When I look at the incorrigible Kim Jong-il, an insult hurled by the incomparable Billy Wilder comes to mind. Leon Wieseltier, the literary editor of The New Republic, was having dinner with Wilder years ago when the subject of Swifty Lazar, the very famous and very short agent, came up. Putting down his knife and fork, Wilder announced: “That man should go hang himself from a bonsai tree.” The diminutive North Korean leader has been known to use lifts in his shoes. This time, he demanded some special stature in the form of a diplomatic cameo by our top diplomat’s husband. There were no bonsais in view, unfortunately. But the two leaders posed, stiff as tree trunks, in front of a mural of waves. Kim Jong-il’s bright smiles were not returned by Bill Clinton. It was strange to see the reclusive Kim so eager and the raffish Clinton so disciplined. Yet the grinning North Korean and stony-faced American were no doubt both savoring their moment of mutual relevance. The price set by Kim for releasing the two captured American journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, was a few hours basking in the presence of the ex-president who most wanted to visit North Korea. Bill Clinton was willing to bow but not scrape. Hillary sparked an international spat when she said that, as a mother, she understood that the North Koreans were simply unpopular and unruly children misbehaving to get attention. Now, less than two weeks later, those bad-seed children had managed to command the full attention of her husband. Maybe it was some clever North Korean revenge plot, giving the limelight to Daddy to punish Mommy. Just as Hillary muscled her way back into the spotlight, moving past her broken elbow and grabbing the focus from her bevy of peacock envoys, she was blown off the radar screen again by an even more powerful envoy: the one she lives with. It was a moment unique in the annals of diplomacy. Bill was being hailed as a dazzling statesman who might have changed the stormy weather between the U.S. and North Korea, just as Hillary was beginning an 11-day trip to Africa designed to highlight the subjects she most cares about: do-gooder development and women’s issues. The one in charge of world affairs disappeared from the news all day on Tuesday.  The one out of office dominated the news. His plane is rolling down the runway in Pyongyang with the two pardoned women on board? Zowie! Bill had the additional schadenfreude spritz of knowing that he had usurped three men he’d had fraught relationships with  —  Bill Richardson, Jimmy Carter and Al Gore (whose media company the women were working for)  —  by getting the high-profile assignment to rescue the damsels in distress. Richardson, labeled “Judas” by James Carville after he endorsed Barack Obama in the campaign, was reduced to the supporting role of CNN commentator, giving Bill props on protocol: “The fact that he saw Kim Jong-il is huge. He only sees big shots and heads of state.” It’s fun to speculate whether Bill and Kim discussed the exchange of insults with Hillary. (North Korea issued a jibe back that Hillary was “a funny lady” and that “sometimes she looks like a primary schoolgirl and sometimes a pensioner going shopping.”) You can picture a charming Bill putting matters in perspective: “Pay no mind to that, Kimmie. She’s an amazin’ woman, but she just goes off sometimes. You should hear what she calls me when she gets riled up. An unruly teenager and then some.” Conservatives were screeching, naturally, that the Clinton trip would provide propaganda cover to the North Koreans to continue their nuclear shell game. “Despite decades of bipartisan U.S. rhetoric about not negotiating with terrorists for the release of hostages,” John Bolton wrote for The Washington Post’s Web site, “it seems that the Obama administration not only chose to negotiate, but to send a former president to do so.” But the former Bush bullies have no credibility on diplomacy. They spent eight years wrecking it, and the score for them on North Korea is 0-6; zero meetings with Kim and enough plutonium for six nuclear bombs. Bill Clinton will bring back valuable information about Kim’s mental and physical health. If we’d had that sort of information about the snubbed Saddam, we would have known that he was in his own spiral of doom, trying to bluff his neighbors, with no need for our shock and awe. Hillary and President Obama look bigger when they share the stage with other talented players. And Barack and Bill may have finally started to put South Carolina behind them  —  without the need for a beer summit photo-op.

As North Korea announced the detonation of a nuclear device, its primary audience may be its own population.

SEOUL, South Korea — WhenNorth Koreasuddenly announced Monday that it had conducted a second nuclear test, the initial view across the region was that this had been yet another defiant gambit by the North to extract more concessions from Washington. That has been the oft-repeated pattern in the past, and is likely to be one motivation now as well, say North Korea watchers. But this time around, North Korea’s succession crisis is the primary impetus, many experts believe, suggesting that the audience for the test is its own population as much as the United States. Monday’s test is the culmination  of  a shift toward a more assertive foreign policy, which some analysts say seems to have begun not long after the North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, is believed to have suffered a stroke in August. Speculation about a successor has focused on his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, which would continue the family dynasty to the third generation — one unique among Communist nations. Some experts say the test was a display of might aimed at showing solidarity with North Korea’s powerful military, whose support would be essential in securing Mr. Kim’s choice of successor. Others believe the intended audience was North Korea’s largely impoverished population, in hopes a display of technological prowess could serve as the elder Mr. Kim’s legacy in a government that has failed to deliver even basic food and electricity. Either way, the North Korean government most likely hopes the test will help ensure a smooth transition of power — and, perhaps, show that the elder Kim is still in charge, at least for now. “Kim Jong-il wants to show that he has given his nation mighty nuclear power,” said Yoon Deok-min, a senior researcher at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security, a Seoul-based research organization. “This test was absolutely a domestic demonstration.” Analysts called the test a sign that the ruling family may be preparing for a transition. Last month, Kim Jong-il’s brother-in-law, Jang Seong-taek, joined the National Defense Commission, the most powerful group in the  government, said Kim Sung-han, an international relations professor at Korea University in Seoul. He said Mr. Jang’s promotion might  be a move to secure support from the military in case Mr. Kim’s health worsens. In April, South Korean news mediareportedthat Kim Jong-un, who is in his mid-20s, was appointed to a low-ranking job in the commission. Mr. Jang, Kim Sung-han said, may also be a caretaker until the younger Kim is old enough to assume power in a society that values seniority. “The test is a signal of Kim Jong-il’s desire to build good ties with the military,” he said. “The military is key to the succession.” To be sure, as North Korea experts admit, trying to fathom this highly secretive government’s motives is an exercise in tea leaf reading. And most North Korea watchers agree that the North is still keen to use nuclear brinksmanship to extract as much aid and food as possible out of Washington, in what has become a tried-and-true strategy. It tried  this in 1998, when it fired a multistage rocket over Japan, following up months later with an offer to halt long-range missile tests. Those concessions resulted in a thaw in ties with Washington that led to a groundbreaking visit two years later by then Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. The problem is that these improvements in relations have often proved short-lived. Just a year ago, North Koreablew up the cooling towerat its mainnuclear weaponsplant after agreeing to give up its weapons program. But it reneged on that promise in April, restarting its program out of anger at United Nations sanctions for a long-range rocket test. There are also those who say the North’s main objective in Monday’s test was simply to advance its nuclear technology, in order to build an independent deterrent along the lines of Israel’s  or Pakistan’s. Early seismic readings show the underground blast, in North Korea’s northeast, was much more powerful than its first nuclear test three years ago, news reports in South Korea said. Most experts agree that the North sees development of nuclear bombs and other weapons as the best way to ensure the current government’s survival. They also say it hopes that this will force the United States to accept North Korea as a nuclear-armed state, just as it dropped its objections to India, and eventually normalize relations. “It is like proposing to someone with a pistol,” said Masao Okonogi, a political scientist at Tokyo’s Keio University. “There is a big gap between North Korea’s goal and its means. But this is the only way that North Korea knows how to operate.” Mr. Okonogi believes that the North conducted Monday’s test mainly to grab Washington’s attention. He said there was a perception among North Korean leaders that their nation has been a lower priority for the new administration of President Obama — a view that does reflect an administration strategy of trying to play down North Korea, given the succession crisis and the current focus on Iran. “They want to be recognized as a nuclear-armed nation,” said Mr. Kim of Korea University. He added, with some hyperbole, “If Washington would do that, I’m sure the North would even be willing to send troops to help in Afghanistan.”

SEOUL, South Korea — One day after an American diplomat offered new talks onNorth Korea’s nuclear program, the North said Friday that it had become useless to talk with the United States, adding that “unchanged” American hostility has caused the country to resume and bolster its nuclear efforts. “The study of the policy pursued by the Obama administration for the past 100 days since its emergence made it clear that the U.S. hostile policy toward the D.P.R.K. remains unchanged,” an unnamed spokesman of the North Korean Foreign Ministry said, using the initials for the North’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. In comments carried by the North’s official news agency, KCNA, the spokesman also said: “There is nothing to be gained by sitting down together with a party that continues to view us with hostility.” The rebuff fromNorth Koreacame as Stephen W. Bosworth, the United States special envoy, began a trip to Northeast Asia with a fresh offer of dialogue. The North’s vow to “bolster its nuclear deterrent” came just hours before Mr. Bosworth was due to arrive in Seoul. “The United States reiterates its desire to engage both multilaterally and bilaterally with North Korea,” Mr. Bosworth told reporters after holding talks with senior Chinese officials on Thursday, The Associated Press reported. “We believe very strongly that the solution to the tensions and problems of the area now lies in dialogue and negotiation.” North Korea recently reversed its nuclear disarmament agreements with Washington, kicking out United Nations nuclear monitors and threatening to restart its plutonium-making plant and test a nuclear device. Washington led United Nations efforts to tighten sanctions against the North after its launching of a long-range rocket on April 5. And while the Obama administration said it was willing to talk with North Korea, it has so far offered no new incentives to draw Pyongyang back to the negotiating table.

To the Editor: Re “North Korea Statement Raises Worry of a Missile Test” (news article, Feb. 24): With North Korea’s apparent preparations to test a missile that could hit not only South Korea and Japan but possibly also Hawaii or Alaska, the United States and its allies need quickly to state publicly a new self-defense doctrine. It could be put as follows: “Should any nation known to possess and to have tested nuclear fissile material launch a missile capable of reaching the United States or any of its allies and apparently on a trajectory to do so, the United States and its allies will not hesitate to destroy that missile.” This is not intended as a threat but as a caution to all nations not to direct missiles for any purpose on trajectories that might be seen to be directed toward other nations. Nor is this new: it is what we would have done at any time during the cold war if we had had the ability to do so. W. D.

The North Korean leader Kim Jong-il might have suffered a stroke weeks ago, an intelligence official said Tuesday.

==::==
WASHINGTON —Kim Jong-il,North Korea’s leader, is seriously ill and is likely to have suffered a stroke weeks ago, American officials said Tuesday, raising the prospect of a chaotic power struggle in nuclear-armed North Korea. Intelligence officials in Washington said that the exact status of Mr. Kim’s health was unclear, but that on Tuesday he failed to attend a celebration of the 60th anniversary of the founding of North Korea and that American intelligence agencies believed that he  was now under the care of doctors in Pyongyang, North Korea’s capital. On Wednesday, Song Il-ho, a senior North Korean diplomat, denied news reports suggesting Mr. Kim was ill. “We see such reports as not only worthless, but rather as a conspiracy plot,” the Kyodo news agency quoted Mr. Song as saying. Later, the country’s No. 2 leader, Kim Yong-nam, said there was “no problem” with Kim Jong-il, Kyodo reported. Kim Jong-il’s health is a topic of intense interest among governments and security experts, especially because Western officials are unclear about who would succeed the man known as the “Dear Leader.” North Korea is one of the world’s most isolated and unpredictable states, and a messy transfer of power would focus new attention on the security of its nuclear weapons arsenal. Mr. Kim had  not missed  the 10 past military parades staged for major anniversaries, during which columns of armored vehicles and rocket launchers rumbled through Pyongyang’s main plaza and legions of goose-stepping soldiers saluted him. But on Tuesday, there was only a parade by militia groups in charge of civil defense, and Mr. Kim did not attend. An American intelligence official, who, like others interviewed for this article, spoke on condition of anonymity because assessments about Mr. Kim’s health are classified, said Tuesday  that it did not appear that Mr. Kim’s death was imminent. The official said there were no clear indications  the North was stepping up preparations for a  transfer of authority. The official would not say whether American intelligence agencies expected Mr. Kim to fully recover. The topic of Mr. Kim’s health came up in discussions between the chief American negotiator on North Korean nuclear issues, Christopher R. Hill, and Chinese officials during a recent trip by Mr. Hill to China, said a Bush administration official. But despite the closer contacts between China and North Korea, the official said, Mr. Hill did not come away with a clear sense of Mr. Kim’s condition, or what would happen in the event of his death. Earlier this year, the North had agreed to abandon its nuclear weapons programs in return for economic and political rewards from the United States and its allies, a major diplomatic victory for the Bush administration. But late last month the North Korean government reversed course. Angry that Washington had not removed it from a terrorism list, it said it had stopped disabling its main nuclear complex. It is now unclear whether Mr. Kim ordered the reversal or whether other North Korean officials were making decisions  while he was incapacitated. Since the founding of North Korea in 1948 under Soviet guardianship, it  has had only two leaders: Kim Il-sung and, after his death in 1994, his son, Kim Jong-il.  Unlike his father, Mr. Kim has not publicly groomed any of his three sons to eventually take power, said Nicholas Eberstadt, a North Korea expert at the American Enterprise Institute. There are doubts about the abilities of all three sons, and American officials tend to gravitate toward theories that a military committee might take over the country. Underlying that guesswork are questions about who within the military hierarchy would control the country’s small arsenal of nuclear weapons. “There are a lot of people who will give you a series of assumptions about what happens to nuclear control if there is a leadership change,” one senior administration official with access to intelligence on North Korea said Tuesday. “To put it charitably, they are guessing.” South Korea’s largest newspaper, Chosun Ilbo, reported Tuesday that Mr. Kim collapsed Aug. 22, citing an unidentified South Korean diplomat in Beijing. The North’s state-run media have not reported any public appearance by Mr. Kim since mid-August, and speculation was already swirling that he might be in poor health. According to South Korea’s intelligence service, Mr. Kim has chronic heart disease and diabetes. He is believed to be in his mid-60s. Among scholars who examine every broadcast and speech from North Korea the way Kremlinologists once examined the Soviet Union, there has been particular focus on the talk given on Monday by Kim Yong-nam, considered the second-ranking official in the country. According to officials in Washington who read a translation of the speech, Mr. Kim appeared at times to refer to the country’s leader in the past tense, saying at one point, “Comrade Kim Jong-il’s seasoned leadership served as a decisive function that brought about the morning light of a powerful Socialist state and unfolded an era of new prosperity of military-first Korea.” But Kim Jong-il was also referred to in the present tense, including one tribute that said he “is a truly peerless patriot.” North Korea experts in Seoul cautioned that Mr. Kim had often disappeared from public view for extended periods. “The nuclear talks are in a stalemate,” said Kim Keun-sik, a North Korea expert at Kyungnam University in South Korea. “Tensions with the United States are deepening. Kim knew that the world was watching whether he would show up today. For him, this may be a perfect chance to bring world attention to him.”

North Korea detailed a picture of widespread devastation on Wednesday after heavy rains wiped out more than a tenth of the impoverished country’s farmland.

SEOUL, South Korea, Aug. 15 (AP) —North Koreadetailed a picture of widespread devastation on Wednesday after heavy rains wiped out more than a tenth of its farmland during peak planting season, according to the official news media. The destruction to the country’s agriculture sector, if confirmed, would amount to a quarter of the damage North Korea asserted it suffered in flooding in 1995. That disaster, coupled with outdated farming methods and the loss of North Korea’s benefactor after the collapse of the Soviet Union, led to a famine that is estimated to have killed as many as two million people. North Korea, an impoverished nation, has said that “hundreds” were killed or missing in this month’s floods and as many as 300,000 people were left homeless. An aid agency working in the country said it had been  told that at least 200 were  killed. The vivid portrait of damage in reports from the North’s state-run news media appeared to be a cry for help from a government that maintains strict secrecy regarding its internal affairs. But North Korea has also previously exaggerated the extent of disasters to obtain aid and cover up its own problems in providing for its people because of its decrepit, centrally controlled economy. The official Korean Central News Agency reported Wednesday that an average of 20.6 inches of rain fell across the country from Aug. 7 through Saturday. The World Food Program estimated that the amount of damage the North Koreans claimed would result in losses of about 450,000 tons of crops — nearly half of the one-million-ton annual shortage the country already faces.

TOKYO, June 20 — The stalled six-nation talks overNorth Korea’s nuclear program are likely to resume next month after international nuclear inspectors visit North Korea next week, the chief United States negotiator said here today. The envoy —  Christopher R. Hill, assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs —  said that the  talks were back on track now that a dispute over $25 million in frozen North Korean assets has been resolved. North Korea had refused to move forward with a February agreement unless the assets, which had been frozen in Banco Delta Asia in Macao following accusations by the United States that they were related to illegal activities, were returned to the regime in Pyongyang. With the money issue resolved, North Korea has invited inspectors from the United Nations nuclear monitoring program, the International Atomic Energy Agency, to the country for talks on how to verify and monitor a shutdown of North Korea’s  plutonium-producing Yongbyon reactor. North Korea expelled the inspectors in late 2002 after the collapse of a 1994 agreement. The six-party talks on dismantling the North’s nuclear weapons program iclude South Korea, Russia, China and Japan as well as North Korea and the United States. “We don’t want to have the six-party talks before we’ve gotten going on shutting down the reactor,” Mr. Hill told reporters today after meeting with Japanese officials here. Asked about the possible timing of the next round of talks, Mr. Hill said: “The Chinese have some ideas about, maybe, we could do something early in July.” Earlier, Mr. Hill said that the inspectors will “take about a week to figure out how to monitor the shutdown — then they need to set up their more permanent teams there, and we need to sequence in some six-party talks.” Under the first phase of an agreement reached in February, North Korea promised to shut down its reactor after its assets were returned, and South Korea promised to ship 50,000 tons of heavy fuel to the energy-starved North after the shutdown is confirmed. Mr. Hill said the next round of talks should focus on how to implement the February agreement’s second phase. That task is expected to be more difficult, because it deals with dismantling all of the North’s nuclear program. South Korea and China welcomed the progress in the agreement’s first phase. Japan, which has adopted the most hawkish stance against the North, has so far refused to participate in the agreement. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said that Japan will join the deal only after the cases of about a dozen Japanese allegedly abducted by North Korea over the years are resolved. “First of all, it is important for North Korea to carry out the initial steps,” Mr. Abe said today. “Of course, North Korea is also not showing a sincere attitude with regard to the abduction problem.”

Officials in the Bush administration were angered as the first deadline for North Korea to shut down and seal its main nuclear fuel facility expired.

WASHINGTON, April 14  —  The first deadline forNorth Koreato shut down and seal its main facility for manufacturing nuclear weapons fuel expired Saturday with no apparent action by the North to fulfill its commitments, while China asked angry officials in the Bush administration to show patience. The inaction leaves President Bush vulnerable to attacks from hawks in his own party, who have argued that it was a mistake to return $25 million in frozen funds to the North Koreans  —  much of it believed to be from illicit sales of counterfeit currency and missiles  —  and who doubt that the North Koreans will stop producing bomb fuel as well as give up all of its existing weapons. The White House was silent about the missed deadline, but the chief American negotiator dealing with the North, Christopher R. Hill, told reporters in Beijing, “We don’t have a lot of momentum right now. That is for sure.” Mr. Hill has traveled over the past week to Japan, South Korea and, most recently, China, where officials urged him to allow a little time for the North Koreans to fulfill the accord. But in Washington, officials said they did not know if the Chinese had any independent indications from the North that compliance was forthcoming, or if the North was simply trying to buy some time. North Korean officials told a visiting American delegation earlier this week that they would begin the process of shutting down their reactor at Yongbyon, where for years they have produced plutonium from spent nuclear fuel, as soon as the $25 million was returned. The process has taken far longer than American officials expected, in part because the legal mechanisms for returning the money turned out to be enormously complicated, leading the Bush administration to give up its demand that all illicit funds had to be used for some kind of humanitarian purpose. But the agreement that Mr. Hill signed with North Korea on Feb. 13  —  in talks that also included China, Russia, Japan and South Korea  —  gave the North 60 days to deactivate and seal its main plant at Yongbyon, invite back international inspectors and provide a preliminary accounting of how much plutonium it has produced. The country had apparently taken none of those steps by Saturday. During a visit to North Korea this week by Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president, officials in Pyongyang said they would fulfill those obligations within 30 days of receiving the money that was held in accounts of Banco Delta Asia, in Macao. Investigators from the United States Treasury and American intelligence agencies pored through records of the frozen accounts, mapped the banking activities of state-owned companies, arms traders and the leaders surrounding President Kim Jong-il. “This was the first thing we ever did that got the North Koreans’ attention,” a senior White House official said in an interview this week, declining to speculate how the administration would react if the North Koreans missed the first deadlines for shutting its facilities. In fact, some administration officials acknowledge that they have few good options. With the money cleared for return, the Macao accounts no longer provide diplomatic leverage. That leaves the administration more dependent than ever on pressure from China, the North’s main supplier of energy and aid, to force North Korea to live up to the agreement. Nicholas Eberstadt, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said that turning the money back to the North “complicates the logic of the Proliferation Security Initiative,” the administration’s plan to stop countries from illicit shipments of weapons, because it is allowing the North to retrieve its profits from those activities. “It also goes contrary to the Security Council resolution” passed at Washington’s urging after North Korea’s nuclear test on Oct. 9, he said. The test was something of a fizzle, a subkiloton explosion, but it was enough to win unanimous passage of a resolution that imposes new economic sanctions on the North. Now, Mr. Eberstadt said, “the North Koreans can force the Bush administration into continuing, humiliating reversals of its policy.” But administration officials dispute that view, arguing that Mr. Bush never reversed his policy. They contend that he simply waited for the right moment to strike the deal, after the nuclear test angered China’s leaders enough to move them from a neutral arbiter in the talks to a source of pressure on the North. North Korea reached the deal, they argue, because both China and South Korea cut aid. In public statements, both Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, have defended the accord as far more effective than an agreement signed between North Korea and President Bill Clinton in 1994, freezing the Yongbyon plant. “What you are hearing,” one senior official said, “are the complaints of a lot of people who simply don’t think we should be dealing with the North Koreans at all.” Among those who have objected, though, are former Bush administration officials who believe that the president has been so eager for a diplomatic coup that he has given up his principles — and is perpetuating Mr. Kim’s rule. Mr. Bush’s former ambassador to the United Nations, John R. Bolton, recently expressed the hope that the North Koreans would violate the Feb. 13 agreement and give Mr. Bush an excuse to renounce the deal. “One sign of whether we are in trouble is whether the administration will call this a  ‘violation’ or use words like “noncompliance,” Mr. Bolton said recently, anticipating that North Korea would miss the Saturday deadline. Assuming that the North allows in international inspectors and seals the Yongbyon plant and the nearby nuclear reprocessing facility where it turns spent nuclear fuel into bomb-grade plutonium, it would then have to move on to the hardest part of the agreement. It is required to “disable” the nuclear facilities, a term that the agreement does not define. Ultimately, it would have to account for, and surrender, all of its nuclear weapons, an arsenal that American intelligence agencies believe has grown from enough fuel for one or two weapons when Mr. Bush took office, to fuel for somewhere between a half-dozen and a dozen weapons.

The funds were frozen when the United States accused a Macao bank of money laundering and distributing counterfeit American currency on behalf of North Korea.

BEIJING, March 22 — Talks here aimed at dismantlingNorth Korea’s nuclear weapons program were halted by China late Thursday after they stalled over the  failure to release from a Macao bank up to $25 million that North Korea had demanded be returned before it continued negotiations. Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state who is leading the American team at the disarmament talks, confirmed that the transfer of the frozen money had been delayed by technical banking issues and said Chinese officials were working to transfer the money from the bank, Banco Delta Asia. No date has been set for the talks to resume, but Mr. Hill said that a Feb. 13 agreement that North Korea would shut down its Yongbyon reactor by April 13 in return for economic aid and that security pledges remained on track. He declined to comment on the specific reasons it was proving difficult to release the money from accounts linked to North Korea. Those accounts have been frozen since September 2005, when the United States accused Banco Delta Asia, a small, family-owned bank, of money laundering and distributing counterfeit American currency on behalf of North Korea. Banco Delta Asia has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Over four days of six-nation talks here this week, North Korean negotiators refused to discuss arms control until the money was transferred to an account North Korea controls in the Bank of China, a state-owned Chinese lender. “To me, it highlights the degree of” North Korea’s “isolation that it sometimes proves difficult to return money to them even when everybody wants to see the money returned to them,” Mr. Hill said. “It really was an issue of how do you move bank accounts.” He said he expected the money to be transferred within days, but there was confusion late Thursday about how North Korea would get it and how much of the $25 million the North was entitled to have. The president of the Bank of China, Li Lihui, said Thursday that the bank had not been asked to handle the transaction. “I can tell you that up until now, we were not asked to deal with this business,” The Associated Press quoted him as telling reporters in Hong Kong. However, China’s chief negotiator at the talks, Wu Dawei, who has been involved in efforts to transfer the money, said that the Bank of China had concerns about accepting it and that “not all the concerns have been assuaged.” Russia chided the United States on Thursday, saying it had undermined the talks. “The American side promised to resolve the financial question, and this promise was not fulfilled,” Aleksandr Losyukov, Russia’s negotiator said, after returning to Moscow, Reuters reported, quoting the Interfax news agency. Accounts controlled by about 50 North Korean banks, trading companies and people were frozen in Banco Delta Asia with $7 million in the account of Daedong Credit Bank, the North’s only foreign-managed bank. After an 18-month investigation, the United States Treasury Department on March 14 banned American banks from dealing with Banco Delta Asia, effectively isolating it from the American financial system. The Treasury Department’s action has angered North Korea and become a major sticking point in nuclear disarmament efforts. In a statement on its Web site, the Macao monetary authority said it would handle all money in Banco Delta Asia according to instructions from the account holders. However, banking analysts said it was unlikely that all account holders would agree to have their money transferred to an account they could not control in the Bank of China. They also questioned whether the Chinese bank would be comfortable accepting money without question from a bank that the United States had accused of crimes. Daedong has said it can prove that the sources of the money frozen in its account are legitimate and has been lobbying officials in Macao and Washington to have the money released. Colin McAskill, a British businessman who is buying the bank, was unavailable for comment. Soon after the United States moved against the bank in September 2005, North Korea boycotted the six-nation talks with protests reported by its state-controlled news media. It consented to return to the talks only when the United States agreed late last year to hold separate negotiations on Banco Delta Asia. The United States announced Monday that the frozen money would be returned to the North via the Bank of China after North Korea pledged that the money would be used for humanitarian purposes and education.

North Korea pledged to honor its commitment to dismantle its nuclear arms program only after sanctions had been lifted on its funds frozen in a bank in Macao since 2005.

BEIJING, March 14 — The chief of theInternational Atomic Energy Agencysaid here on Wednesday thatNorth Koreahad pledged to honor its commitment to dismantle its nuclear arms program only after sanctions had been lifted on its funds frozen in a bank in Macao since 2005, which could introduce a snag in carrying out the accord negotiated with the United States last month. In Washington on Wednesday, the Treasury Department concluded a year-and-a-half investigation into the bank, Banco Delta Asia, with the expected announcement of a ban on American banks doing business with it. The end of the investigation is expected to lead to the return of part of $25 million in frozen North Korea funds, but the amount and timing remain unclear. American officials have said that the authorities in Macao, a semiautonomous region of China, would decide those issues, but that only funds related to legitimate activities would be returned, not those connected with illicit activities like money laundering, counterfeiting, and narcotics and weapons trafficking. They have expressed confidence that a partial release of funds would satisfy North Korea. On the other hand, some American officials say that the nuclear disarmament accord with North Korea is delicate. They say that North Korea’s behavior is often unpredictable, and that in the past the North has agreed to something in principle  but then has seized on relatively small points in  how  it has been carried out as a pretext for backing out of the agreement. Mohamed ElBaradei, the chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency, spoke after a visit to Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. It was the first such visit by an official of the United Nations nuclear agency since 2002, when North Korea expelled nuclear inspectors stationed there under a previous disarmament accord. The United States and North Korea accused each other of violating the accord that year, and North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty shortly thereafter. Dr. ElBaradei said North Korean officials had pledged to adhere to the terms of the Feb. 13 accord, which requires that it close its main facility to produce plutonium in exchange for shipments of heavy fuel oil, and allows nuclear inspectors back into the country. But he said the officials emphasized that they would not act until the United States resolved the dispute over the deposits. The North Korean officials “mentioned that they are waiting for the lifting of sanctions with regard to the Macao bank,” Dr. ElBaradei said. Referring to the closing of the nuclear complex at Yongbyon, he said, “They said they are ready, willing and capable of doing that as soon as the financial sanctions are lifted.” The scope and timing of nuclear inspections remain to be worked out in future talks, but Dr. ElBaradei said his trip had been intended to restore ties between his agency and North Korean officials, and he called his meetings “quite useful.” His visit ended as Christopher R. Hill, an assistant secretary of state and the lead United States negotiator at the six-nation talks involving the North Korean nuclear program, arrived in Beijing for a new round of negotiations on how to carry out the Feb. 13 accord. Detailed discussions on various aspects of the accord were expected to continue into next week, and are viewed as essential if North Korea is  to  follow through on its promise to shut down Yongbyon by mid-April.

Saying North Korea had agreed to adhere to nuclear concessions, the U.S. took it off a list of terrorism sponsors.
==::==

WASHINGTON — The Bush administration announced Saturday that it had removedNorth Koreafrom a list of state sponsors of terrorism in a bid to salvage a fragile nuclear deal that seemed on the verge of collapse. Sean McCormack, the State Department spokesman, said that the United States made the decision after North Korea agreed to resume disabling a plutonium plant and to allow some inspections to verify that it had halted its nuclear program as promised months earlier. The deal, which the Bush administration had portrayed as a major foreign policy achievement, began slipping away in recent weeks in a dispute over the verification program. Just days ago, North Korea barred international inspectors from the plant. The decision to remove North Korea from the terror list was a dramatic moment for President Bush, who had called the country part of an “axis of evil” and had only reluctantly ordered administration officials to engage in negotiations, saying that the United States had made deals with the nation’s leaders before without winning enough concessions. That calculus changed in 2006, when North Korea exploded a nuclear device. But Mr. Bush is already having trouble selling the new agreement to his own party. Republican lawmakers, including the presidential nominee, Senator John McCain, quickly expressed concern, complaining that North Korea had yet to demonstrate that it was serious about adhering to its commitment to denuclearize. Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee for president, called the deal “a modest step forward” in dismantlingNorth Korea’s nuclear weaponsprogram. Other Democrats said they welcomed the agreement but noted that it did not go much beyond an agreement President Clinton reached with North Korea in 1994, which the Bush administration, including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, criticized as inadequate. Bush administration officials, trying to head off potential criticism that they were simply seeking a foreign policy victory in their last months, said the agreement was the best the United States could get at this time. Ms. Rice “very strongly feels that it is our own responsibility, until Jan. 20, 2009, to act as good stewards of the national interest,” Mr. McCormack said during a news conference. In the most significant part of the accord announced Saturday, North Korea agreed to a verification plan that would allow United States inspectors access to its main declared nuclear compound, at Yongbyon; international inspectors have worked at the site on and off for years. But the deal puts off decisions on the thorniest verification issue: what would happen if international experts suspected the North was hiding other nuclear weapons facilities, particularly those related to uranium enrichment. The United States wanted the North to agree to inspections at sites that raised suspicions, but North Korea balked. The new agreement calls for United States inspectors to be granted access to such sites “based on mutual consent” with North Korea. Experts on North Korea say that the concession by the United States was probably necessary to achieve a deal, but that it no doubt will lead to future fights, since the North’s leaders will not want to give inspectors free rein to travel the country. Patricia A. McNerney, one of the State Department negotiators, acknowledged that issue would probably lead to a hornets’ nest of problems. “Going into verification with North Korea will not be easy, we know that,” she said. “This is the most secret and opaque regime in the world.” North Korea, which has long sought international acceptance, had been pushing hard to get off the terror list. But Mr. McCormack made clear on Saturday that North Korea is still subject to numerous economic sanctions. The agreement follows weeks of intense negotiations and high-stakes brinkmanship, as North Korea, furious that the Bush administration had not removed it from the terrorism list as it agreed last summer, threatened to restart its plutonium-based weapons program and barred international inspectors from the Yongbyon plant. In Washington, State Department proponents of the deal, including Ms. Rice and her top North Korea envoy, Christopher R. Hill, battled critics inside and outside the administration who castigated them for trying to salvage the accord. The administration has been at war with itself over whether to go ahead with the North Korea pact despite objections from critics in the office of Vice President Dick Cheney, and even some members of the State Department’s verification and compliance office. That rift spilled into the open at the news conference on Saturday, when a reporter asked Paula A. DeSutter, the assistant secretary of state for verification, compliance and implementation, how she responded to criticism of the deal from John R. Bolton, her former boss at the State Department. Ms. DeSutter did not defend the accord, saying simply, “John is the epitome of a skeptical policymaker, and that’s appropriate.” Despite the internal fights, Ms. Rice convinced President Bush last week that this was the best the administration could get in its remaining time in office. But as late as Friday, things remained up in the air, said one administration official, who, like several other officials and diplomats interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the issue. Another senior administration official described the internal deliberations as a “close call.” Senator McCain said in a statement that he would not support the deal until he got some questions answered. “I expect the administration to explain exactly how this new verification agreement advances American interests and those of our allies,” he said. He added that he was “concerned that this latest agreement appears to have been reached between Washington and Pyongyang, and only then discussed with our Asian allies in an effort to garner their support.” Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Republican of Florida, issued a statement strongly criticizing the deal. “I am profoundly disappointed,” she said. “By rewarding North Korea before the regime has carried out its commitments, we are encouraging this regime to continue its illicit nuclear program and violate its pledge to no longer provide nuclear assistance to extremist regimes.” Two of the Bush administration’s main criticisms of the 1994 accord were that it did not mandate the removal of nuclear material from North Korea and that international inspectors were limited to  Yongbyon. The 1994 accord collapsed in 2002 after the Bush administration accused North Korea of circumventing the agreement by pursuing a second path to a bomb, based on enriching uranium. The White House said at the time that it would require full verification that any uranium program had been halted, though later the intelligence community expressed some doubts about how far the program had gotten. Although the new agreement leaves open the possibility of future inspections outside Yongbyon, it leaves vague what mechanism would be used to determine the status of a uranium program. The North has agreed in principle to give up its nuclear material and any weapons, but that seems almost certain to be subject to negotiations with the next president. During the Bush administration, North Korea is believed to have produced enough bomb-grade plutonium for six or more nuclear weapons. Bush administration officials have been consulting about the latest deal with its partners in the so-called “six-party” talks, the group including Russia, South Korea and Japan that negotiated the agreement in 2007 for the North to halt its nuclear activities. Diplomats said that Japan had expressed reservations about removing North Korea from the terror list because the North still had not addressed all of their concerns about abductions of Japanese citizens decades ago. After the official announcement on Saturday, Japan’s finance minister, Shoichi Nakagawa, called the American decision “extremely regrettable.” South Korea has been more supportive. “We welcome the agreement because we believe this will help put the six-party negotiations back on track and eventually lead to the dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear programs,” said Kim Sook, South Korea’s main nuclear envoy, during a news conference in Seoul on Sunday. The South Korean foreign minister, Yu Myung-hwan, had stressed Friday that if the six-party negotiations fell apart now, the next administration would have difficulty restarting them. Gary Samore, a nonproliferation expert in the Clinton administration, characterized the deal as probably the best that could be gotten at this time, but warned of stormy times to come. “Every agreement you ever have with the North Koreans always contains certain ambiguities, and that ends up being the basis for which you have the next round of talks,” he said. “It’s always two steps forward and one step back.” For instance, he said, besides the issue of access to suspected nuclear sites, the United States and North Korea appear to have fudged the critical issue of whether American inspectors will be allowed to take all the samples they want out of the country to foreign laboratories for inspection. According to a fact sheet issued by the Bush administration, the two sides agreed “on the use of scientific procedures, including sampling and forensic activities,” although the sheet doesn’t say where those tests would be done. Mr. Bolton, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations under Mr. Bush, said that the Bush administration had “punted” the hardest issue, that of inspections beyond declared nuclear sites. “This means that North Korea has a veto over everything beyond Yongbyon,” he said, “so that’s a clear victory for North Korea.”

Shifting dynamics between civilian officials and military leaders may have led to steps toward denuclearization.

TOKYO — International television crews were invited to reclusiveNorth Koreaon Friday to witness the destruction of the cooling tower at the country’s main nuclear weapons plant. Viewers around the world later watched the most visible symbol of the North’s nuclear ambitions collapse in a cloud of shattered concrete. In North Korea itself, however, the explosion was a nonevent. The state news agency  carried no information about it on Friday, and the images had not found their way onto state television. News blackouts are not big news in isolated North Korea, which also let a full day pass before it let its people know, on state television and radio, that President Bush had removed it from the United States’ list of countries that sponsor terrorism. It couched that development in a  warning that Washington had not yet fully abandoned its “hostile policy” toward the North. Mr. Bush characterized the latest steps toward denuclearization as a “moment of opportunity for North Korea.” But the North’s cagey reaction suggests that any lasting change inKim Jong-il’s secretive, xenophobic approach to governing one of the world’s most cloistered nations is likely to be painfully slow, at best. Though there are hints that North Korea’s powerful military may have relaxed what analysts have described as its wariness about bargaining in earnest on nuclear weapons, experts warn that it is far from clear that Mr. Kim intends to give up all of the country’s existing atomic bombs or the capacity to produce new ones. Still, North Korea watchers in neighboring South Korea and China say that this week’s deal appeared to have emerged from the shifting dynamics between North Korea’s reform-oriented civilian officials and hard-line military leaders. If the civilian leadership keeps the upper hand, that could foreshadow a more robust pace of change in the country’s deeply impoverished economy, they say. “I don’t think it was one group winning against the other, but I think this agreement came out of long discussions between civilian and military leaders,” said Song Min-soon, who served as South Korea’s chief nuclear negotiator and then as foreign minister from late 2006 to early this year. “Groups inside North Korea who want to reform will now gain a voice.” In his past negotiations, Mr. Song said, his North Korean counterparts referred often to objections from “other institutions in Pyongyang,” the capital, which the South Koreans interpreted as the military and officials from the ruling party. “For some time, I thought it was just an excuse not to make a deal, but later I came to believe that it was not just an excuse but the reality there,” said Mr. Song, who is now a member of the National Assembly. Even if they disagreed about the nuclear program and relations with the outside world, however, reformers and hard-liners are driven by a shared goal of survival, experts said. Paik Hak-soon, a North Korea expert at the Sejong Institute in Seoul, South Korea, said that since the collapse of the Soviet Union, North Korea had basically pursued the long-term goal of formally ending the Korean War and normalizing relations with the United States. “That is the only way for North Korea to survive,” Mr. Paik said. “North Korea wanted the United States to come to the negotiating table, and since the United States did not want to come voluntarily, North Korea used the nuclear card.” It is a card that the North is unlikely to give up easily. In Thursday’s declaration, the North disclosed its plutonium-related activities at the Yongbyon reactor, its main nuclear plant. But the much more difficult task of persuading the North to give up its existing nuclear weapons, estimated at roughly half a dozen, comes in the next stage of talks. North Korea’s declaration did not specify how many nuclear bombs it had. Officials there have not formally addressed Washington’s contention that, in addition to its well-known efforts to make nuclear fuel from plutonium, the country has a parallel, underground program to make bomb fuel from enriched uranium. Xu Guangyu, a Chinese analyst often sympathetic to North Korea, said negotiations were unlikely to advance much, given  Mr. Bush’s short time  in office. “North Korea is not going to give up their nuclear weapons easily,” he said. “That is the last card they have to play with America. They want to keep their card to see what the next president will do with North Korea.” Friday’s destruction of the tower, the most conspicuous element of the nuclear complex at Yongbyon, 60 miles north of Pyongyang, did reaffirm the incremental progress that had been made in Chinese-brokered multilateral negotiations to end North Korea’s weapons programs. While the North  has  kept its nuclear activities shrouded in secrecy, steam curling from the tower into the atmosphere was captured in spy satellite photographs, providing outside observers with the most visible sign of operations at Yongbyon. “As you all saw, the cooling tower is no longer there,” Sung Kim, a senior State Department official who witnessed the blast from a hill, told South Korean television. “It’s a very significant disablement step.” But some experts in South Korea said the demolition did not answer critical questions, such as how many weapons North Korea has built or whether it has exported its nuclear technology to countries like Syria. “It’s symbolic. But in real terms, whether demolishing or not a cooling tower that has already been disabled doesn’t make much difference,” said Lee Ji-sue, a North Korea expert at Seoul’s Myongji University. The demolition also shows that North Korea has concluded that the Yongbyon complex, in service for several decades, has served its purpose after producing an unknown number of nuclear weapons, Mr. Lee said. Whether North Korea’s removal from the terrorism list and the lifting of other sanctions announced by Mr. Bush on Thursday lead to much economic progress could depend, again, on how the tensions between reformers and conservatives play out. In the past, China has encouraged Mr. Kim to emulate its own success by reforming and opening its failing state-run economy. In recent years, North Korea has experimented with some isolated market reforms and allowed the opening of a South Korean-run industrial complex in Kaesong, just north of the demilitarized zone. But Jin Linbo, a senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, said Mr. Kim had shown no real interest in a systemic economic overhaul.  “These experiments can only be regarded as ways that North Korea is trying in order to find a way to make money,” he said. As for large-scale economic reforms, “No, that is too dangerous for the regime,” he said. But Moon Chung-in, a political scientist at Yonsei University in Seoul who was South Korea’s ambassador for international security affairs until earlier this year, said he believed that economic change would accelerate now that progress had been made on the nuclear accord. “Whenever I’ve met party officials in the past, they’ve told me: ‘We don’t want the United States or South Korea to dictate how to manage our economy. You cannot make us open up and reform. But we really are desperate and want to modernize the motherland,’ ” Mr. Moon said. “You have to be careful about not using the word ‘reform’; they are sensitive about that and prefer ‘modernize,’ ” he said. Thursday’s deal could also provide a boost to North Korea’s special industrial zone, which, despite restrictions, has been growing steadily since opening in late 2004. Today, 72 companies employing 294,702 North Koreans operate there. They include three foreign companies: two Chinese manufacturers and a German auto-parts maker. “European companies were careful about going to Kaesong because they didn’t want to be linked with North Korea,” said Jean-Jacques Grauhar, secretary general of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in Seoul, which toured Kaesong last month. “But now companies will be more serious about looking at business opportunities in North Korea.”

Responding to the growing threat of a humanitarian crisis, the European Union said it would provide about $14.5 million in emergency aid.

BRUSSELS — Responding to the growing threat of a humanitarian crisis inNorth Korea, theEuropean Unionannounced on Monday that it will provide about $14.5 million in emergency aid to feed more than some 650,000 North Koreans. The bloc’s executive body, the European Commission, said that after its experts witnessed evidence of a developing crisis last month during a mission toNorth Korea, it negotiated an agreement with the North Koreans about how to monitor the delivery of assistance. “Increasingly desperate and extreme measures are being taken by the hard-hit North Koreans, including the widespread consumption of grass,” the European Commission said in a statement. The severity of the situation prompted a switch of tactics by the commission. In 2008, it stopped sending humanitarian aid to North Korea in favor of offering financing for longer-term development projects. “The purpose of this aid package is to save the lives of at least 650,000 people who could otherwise die from lack of food,” Kristalina Georgieva, a European commissioner, said in the statement. “Our experts saw severely malnourished children in hospitals and nurseries where no treatment was available. “North Korea’s chronicnutritionproblem is turning into an acute crisis in some parts of the country.” Former PresidentJimmy Carterand two other former presidents,Mary Robinsonof Ireland andMartti Ahtisaariof Finland, and former Prime MinisterGro Harlem Brundtlandof Norway traveled to North Korea in April and issued grave warnings about the food situation there. (All four are members of theElders, an independent group of world leaders established byNelson Mandela.) Mr. Carter was particularly concerned about the refusal of the United States and South Korea to send humanitarian assistance to the North, saying their deliberate withholding offood aidamounted to “a human rights violation.” Mr. Carter, 86, who was not traveling as an official American envoy, had been invited to North Korea for meetings with senior political and military officials. Mrs. Robinson echoed Mr. Carter’s concerns about what she called the “very serious crisis” over food supplies in North Korea because of a harsh winter, severe flooding and an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. She said the withdrawal of American and South Korean food shipments had aggravated a dire situation, which had become, she said, “a matter of life-and-death urgency.” The United States recently sent a team of experts to evaluate food and hunger conditions in North Korea. But the Obama administration has not yet decided about a resumption of food shipments. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said recently that “North Korea must address our serious concerns about monitoring.” Integral to any agreement to restart American aid deliveries, she said, would be “our ability to ensure and monitor that whateverfood aidis provided actually reaches the people who are in need.” After his trip in April, Mr. Carter said North Korean officials had guaranteed to make changes to the aid-distribution system so that Western governments and donors could track their deliveries and be certain that their aid was not being diverted to the military or the ruling elite. The European aid will be distributed through theWorld Food Program, which has been used by the United States and other countries and donors. Ms. Georgieva said it would be strictly monitored, from the point of delivery at ports to when it reached recipients. “If at any stage we discover that the aid is being diverted from its intended recipients, then the commission will not hesitate to end its humanitarian intervention,” she said. According to the European Commission, its experts found that in North Korea the state-distributed food rations had been more than halved in recent months. Two-thirds of the population depends on the rations, it said. The per-person ration, which had been 400 grams of cereals per day, about 14 ounces, was reduced to 150 grams, about 5.3 ounces, in June. That is a fifth of the daily average nutritional requirement, according to European experts. Most of the rations consist of corn. “Food assistance will reach children under 5 who have already been hospitalized with severe acutemalnutrition,” the commission said in the statement. “Children in residential care will also be fed, as well as pregnant andbreast-feedingwomen, hospital patients and the elderly.” The food shortages have been caused by years of economic mismanagement and underinvestment, and have been made worse by poor weather and a reduction of food imports from China and South Korea. The next main grain harvest is in October. Initially, the North Koreans had planned to import 353,000 tons of grains, but that target was reduced to 220,000 tons, of which about half has been secured so far, European experts said. The North Korean government has promised unrestricted access for random checks related to the aid, the commission said. While distributing the European aid, the World Food Program will pay 400 visits per month to warehouses, institutions caring for children, hospitals and distribution sites.

North Korea showed an American scientist last week a vast new facility it secretly and rapidly built to enrich uranium.

WASHINGTON —North Koreashowed a visiting American nuclear scientist earlier this month a vast new facility it secretly and rapidly built to enrich uranium, confronting the Obama administration with the prospect that the country is preparing to expand its nuclear arsenal or build a far more powerful type of atomic bomb. Whether the calculated revelation is a negotiating ploy by North Korea or a signal that it plans to accelerate its weapons program even as it goes through a perilous leadership change, it creates a new challenge forPresident Obamaat a moment when his program for gradual, global nuclear disarmament appears imperiled at home and abroad. The administration hurriedly began to brief allies and lawmakers on Friday and Saturday — and braced for an international debate over the repercussions. The scientist, Siegfried S. Hecker, a Stanford professor who previously directed the Los Alamos National Laboratory, said in an interview that he had been “stunned” by the sophistication of the new plant, where he saw “hundreds and hundreds” of centrifuges that had just been installed in a recently gutted building that had housed an aging fuel fabrication center, and that were operated from what he called “an ultra-modern control room.” The North Koreans claimed 2,000 centrifuges were already installed and running, he said. American officials know that the plant did not exist in April 2009, when the last Americans and international inspectors were thrown out of the country. The speed with which it was built strongly suggests that the impoverished, isolated country, which tested its first nuclear device in 2006, had foreign help and evaded strict newUnited Nations Security Councilsanctions imposed to punish its rejection of international controls. A delegation of American experts that included Dr. Hecker has already reported that it confirmed satellite photographic evidence of another new advance by the North — a light-water reactor being built on the site of a facility the country had dismantled as part of an agreement with the international community to end itsnuclear weaponsprogram. Dr. Hecker did not initially mention the surprising discovery of the uranium enrichment operation as he left North Korea. He privately informed the White House a few days ago. The White House is clearly eager to use the new information to show that North Korea, in violation of United Nations mandates, continues to make significant progress toward advancing its nuclear program, even though it remains under international sanctions for its past violations. American officials were sent to China, Japan, Russia and South Korea, the other members in the moribund “six-party talks.” The Obama administration also hopes to persuade China, by far North Korea’s most important source of political and economic support, to put more pressure on the government ofKim Jong-il, which has shown signs of becoming more militaristic as it undergoes a leadership transition. China has been hesitant to cut off trade or fuel to the North, and it appears determined to support its longtime, if difficult, ally during its succession process. But in the past China has taken modest steps to support a tougher line when North Korea has tested nuclear weapons or missiles, defying international commitments. Dr. Hecker said he was forbidden from taking pictures during his tour of the uranium plant on Nov. 12, and was not allowed to verify North Korean claims that it was already beginning to produce low-enriched uranium. He also said he had doubts that North Korea would fulfill its promise to build a light-water reactor to utilize the fuel. “There are reasons to question whether that’s true,” he said. There are two routes to a nuclear weapon: obtaining plutonium from the spent fuel produced by a nuclear reactor, and enriching uranium to weapons grade. Since the 1950s, North Korea pursued the first path, and its arsenal of weapons was manufactured from fuel harvested from a small nuclear reactor at Yongbyon. That produced enough for roughly a dozen weapons, but the facility was decrepit, and under an agreement with the Bush administration it was shut down in 2008, with television cameras running as its cooling tower was blown up. But meanwhile, the North was already well down the second path, uranium enrichment, much the way Iran has pursued its nuclear program. Like Iran, North Korea insists the fuel is intended for a yet-to-be-built experimental reactor to make electricity. American officials, though, say they think the intent of the enrichment program is to make weapons fuel. Since the North has blocked international inspections, it may be impossible to monitor how much fuel it has made, or if it could be used to produce or improve atomic bombs. For roughly 15 years, American intelligence agencies have reported evidence the North was seeking to enrich uranium, largely based on technology it bought from A. Q. Khan, the rogue Pakistani nuclear dealer, in a transaction that dates from 1996. There were later reports of North Korean efforts to buy critical centrifuge components, and a suspicious shipment of uranium hexafluoride to Libya that appeared to be of North Korean origin. The Bush administration accused the North in 2002 of secretly pursuing the technology, leading to the ouster of inspectors. In interviews, administration officials said that they were watching the area by satellite where Dr. Hecker saw the new facility, but they would not say whether they knew about it before he reported back. “The intel agencies dropped the ball,” said Jack Pritchard, a former State Department official who visited North Korea’s main nuclear complex, Yongbyon, a week before Dr. Hecker’s visit and heard North Korean boasts of a new capability. A senior intelligence official said Saturday evening that “it is wrong for anyone to assert that U.S. intelligence agencies somehow missed the boat,” adding, “We have been aware of North Korean uranium enrichment activities for years.” A senior administration official said the North Koreans “very probably have other facilities” that pre-dated the one at Yongbyon and have not been detected. In interviews, administration officials said they did not want to talk about possible responses to the North Korean action. But their options are limited. North Korea is already a de facto nuclear state; it conducted its first nuclear test in 2006 and another shortly after President Obama took office. Sanctions have crippled some of the country’s ability to do business, but clearly they have not forced it to give up its nuclear ambitions. Military attacks on Yongbyon have been all but ruled out. In interviews over the past two days, administration officials have described several possible motives for the North to build the facility, and to boast about it. The most obvious is to create a new bargaining chip to try to force Mr. Obama to pay off the country. “It’s typical of North Korea, to see if we will reward them” for suspending operations or dismantling the facility, said one senior administration official. But there are other possible explanations. Just as the North used the sinking of a South Korean warship this year to build the credentials of its leader-in-waiting, Kim Jong-un, the son of the current leader and grandson of the country’s founder, this effort could be designed to show that the North must be accepted as a nuclear state along with the major nuclear powers and Pakistan, India and Israel. Administration officials said they had no intention of reopening negotiations with the North unless it “demonstrated a seriousness of purpose and constructive action” to live up to its past promises to dismantle its nuclear facilities. Another possibility, which administration officials declined to discuss, is that the North ultimately intends to build a new generation of hydrogen bombs or thermonuclear weapons, far more powerful than anything in its current arsenal. The North’s current arsenal of 8 to 12 weapons are all based on plutonium. But uranium, enriched to bomb grade, can also be used to drastically increase the destructive power of a nuclear blast, and that is the main use of uranium in modern arsenals, including United States warheads. Experts caution, however, that true hydrogen bombs are quite hard to make, so it seems unlikely that North Korea would succeed in that anytime soon.

North Koreans commemorated the anniversary by bowing before a statue of its first leader, Kim Il-sung, as speculation abroad deepened over crucial political developments in the reclusive nation.

SEOUL, South Korea — North Koreans marked the 62nd anniversary of their nation’s founding on Thursday with ceremonies honoring its first leader, Kim Il-sung, as speculation abroad deepened over political developments in the reclusive nation. North Koreahad said that delegates of the ruling Workers’ Party would meet in the capital, Pyongyang, in early September. The meeting, the largest party gathering since 1980, was widely seen as a chance for Kim Jong-il, the founder’s son and the current leader, to reaffirm his control over the party and promote one of his sons, Kim Jong-un, as the heir to family rule. As of late Thursday, however, North Korea had offered no word as to whether the meeting was under way. Its state-run media have reported only that delegates werearriving in Pyongyang. Analysts and news media in Seoul had predicted that the party meeting would start by the Thursday anniversary. They have now begun speculating that North Korea might have delayed the meeting because roads damaged by recent floods had stranded delegates from provincial towns, or because of Mr. Kim’s failing health. The debate in the South has also turned linguistic. Some experts here argued that when North Korea said the meeting would be in “sangsun,” or “early,” September, it could have meant the first half of the month. In the North, soldiers in uniform and women in colorful traditional dresses presented flowers and bowed before a giant bronze statue of Kim Il-sung on a hill overlooking Pyongyang, a scene capturedon video by Associated Press Television News. Party officials made pilgrimages toKumsusan Memorial Palacein Pyongyang, where Mr. Kim’s embalmed body lies in state, according to North Korean media. Kim Jong-il appears to prize the mystery surrounding his government. When he met President Kim Dae-jung of South Korea in 2000, he seemed delighted to learn that the outside world regarded him as a hermit and his government as an enigma. His rise to power during the cold war years was accompanied by intense speculation by outside analysts about his leadership ability and personal quirks. The South Korean news media are once again rife with speculation as Mr. Kim prepares to take his family’s rule into a third generation. The North’s state-run media have never mentioned Kim Jong-un by name or published photographs of him. Few North Korea watchers in Seoul believe thatKim Jong-un, believed to be in his late 20s,would formally assume power as long as his father was alive and in office. But analysts were watching to see whether he would assume significant party posts during the coming meeting. Kim Jong-il, now 68, oversaw important party affairs years before he officially took over after Kim Il-sung’s death in 1994. No such apprenticeship was reported for Kim Jong-un until afterhis father had a strokein 2008. The North’s economy is weaker than when Kim Jong-il inherited power. But his military, with itsnuclear weapons, has become a bigger threat to the region. In Seoul, Unification Minister Hyun In-taek said at a forum: “North Korea stands at the crossroads. Despite its intention, its nuclear weapons development is deepening the instability of its regime and its economic crisis.”

Who knew “Mad Men” had hit Pyongyang? North Korea makes an attempt to create brand awareness.

WASHINGTON WHO knew “Mad Men” had hit Pyongyang? Or so it seemed last week, when the North Korean governmentreleased photographs of a rare meeting of the Korean Workers’ Party, and delegates were seen walking purposefully through Pyongyang Station on their way to formally designate the next ruler of the Kim dynasty. That would beKim Jong-un, son of the ailing Dear Leader,Kim Jong-il, and grandson of the Great Leader, Kim Il-sung. The delegates wore suits of nearly identical, somewhat boxy cut, and carried 1960s-style briefcases that the admen of the AMC television series might have swung on Madison Avenue. It was a flashback for anyone lucky enough to have ever strolled the empty streets of Pyongyang, a capital in a time machine, with its Stalin-era ceremonial buildings and limousines that could have fit the Kennedy era. Like the Mad Men, the attendees at the Korean Workers’ Party session were trying to create brand awareness — and they don’t have much time to do so. Pyongyang had decades to build up mythologies about how Grandpa Kim singlehandedly ousted the Japanese, and how Papa Kim offered benevolent “guidance” in building each factory. But the last transition unfolded over 20 years. With Kim Jong-il clearly sick, this transition has to be fast, which is why Kim Jong-un went from civilian to four-star general in an announcement on the state radio. It is also why the photographs last week were read so carefully here in Washington. There were hints of whatNorth Korea’s leaders wish the world to see, and what they hope nobody will notice. “These are pictures about one united party, one enduring bloodline,” said Nicholas Eberstadt of theAmerican Enterprise Institute, “and an obstinate refusal to change direction.”

The sanctions, announced by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, aim to cut off sources of hard currency. 
==::==
2010-07-22T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — The Obama administration announced Wednesday that it would impose further economic sanctions againstNorth Korea, throwing legal weight behind a choreographed show of pressure on the North that included an unusual joint visit to the demilitarized zone by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates. The measures, announced here by Mrs. Clinton after talks with South Korean officials, focus on counterfeiting, money laundering and other dealings that she said the North Korean government used to generate hard currency to pay off cronies and cling to power. While the United States already places heavy sanctions on North Korea, American officials insisted that the new measures would further tighten the financial vise around the secretive and isolated North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, who, according to regional intelligence,is in declining health. The unilateral American action came two months after a South Korean-led investigationfound North Korea responsiblefor the March sinking of theCheonan, a South Korean warship, which killed 46 sailors. The North’s bellicose behavior, analysts say, reflects a deepening power struggle inside the country. But the United States has struggled to build consensus about how harshly to confront the Kim government. While the United Nations Security Council voted tocondemn the sinking of the warship, it did not name North Korea as the culprit because of resistance from China, the North’s neighbor and most important ally. Mrs. Clinton demanded that the North take responsibility for the attack, saying it would continue to be a pariah until it did so. She ruled out any negotiations with the North Korean government until it agreed to relinquish itsnuclear weapons. And she said that the United States would expand and stiffen its sanctions to “target their leadership, target their assets.” “These measures are not directed at the people of North Korea, who have suffered for too long due to the misguided and maligned priorities of their government,” Mrs. Clinton said at a news conference, flanked by Mr. Gates and South Korea’s defense and foreign ministers. “They are directed at the destabilizing, illicit and provocative policies pursued by that government.” Her announcement punctuated a visit rich in symbols of American diplomacy and military might, organized to mark the 60th anniversary of the start of the Korean War. On Tuesday, the United States and South Korea confirmed that they would stagelarge-scale military exercisesin the seas off Japan and the Korean Peninsula, as a show of deterrence against the North. Then, on Wednesday, Mr. Gates and Mrs. Clinton traveled to Panmunjom, in the demilitarized zone, where they clambered up an observation post in a gloomy drizzle to peer into the North. Later, as the pair toured a small building that straddles the military demarcation line between North and South, a North Korean soldier stared at them through a window. Neither acknowledged the soldier. Afterward, the two stood before a phalanx of cameras, under the gaze of guards from the North Korean side, to proclaim solidarity with South Korea. “It is stunning how little has changed up there and yet how much South Korea continues to grow and prosper,” Mr. Gates said, noting that this was his third visit to the demilitarized zone — the first being in the early 1990s when he was director of central intelligence. It was Mrs. Clinton’s first visit. “Although it may be a thin line,”she said, referring to the narrow strip of land separating the two sides, “these two places are worlds apart.” Mrs. Clinton is heading to a regional security meeting in Vietnam on Thursday, where she is likely to face more reluctance to point fingers at North Korea over the Cheonan. On Tuesday, the meeting’s sponsor, theAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations, issued an opening statement that said it “deplored” the sinking but did not name the aggressor. The administration’s show of solidarity with South Korea has complicated ties with China. In addition to its balkiness at the United Nations,Beijing has objected to the joint naval exercises, which have frayed an already tense relationship between the militaries of China and the United States and also prompted a rebuke from North Korea on Thursday. Earlier this year, Beijing brusquelycanceled a planned visitby Mr. Gates. “I remain open to rebuilding and strengthening military-to-military dialogue between the United States and China,” Mr. Gates said. But he added, “We are obviously concerned by some of the things China has said, some of the things China is doing in the military arena; they are worrying.” Administration officials would not give specifics on the planned North Korean sanctions, but said they would mainly build on those already put in place by the Treasury Department or enshrined in the latest Security Council resolution against North Korea. Mrs. Clinton said the United States would designate North Korean companies and individuals involved in weapons proliferation and other illicit activity. As an example, American officials cited trade in counterfeit cigarettes. The sanctions would also focus on liquor, exotic foods and other luxury goods, which the government in Pyongyang uses in a vast system of patronage. And they will take aim at North Korean officials who use diplomatic privilege to cloak their dealings. Mrs. Clinton said she would send her adviser on nonproliferation and arms control, Robert J. Einhorn, in coming days to discuss the sanctions with countries in Asia. Because no legitimate American banks do business with the North, the effectiveness of the measures will depend heavily on persuading banks in other countries to shun North Korea. Given the North’s profound isolation, some analysts question how much more damage sanctions can do. The strategy of aiming sanctions at the country’s elite is similar to the latest United Nations sanctions against Iran. A previous effort to punish politically connected North Koreans, by freezing assets in a Macao-based bank, Banco Delta Asia, where many of them had accounts, was quite successful, analysts said. But the Bush administration later agreed to have the Macao governmentunblock those accountsin an effort to lure North Korea back to negotiations over its nuclear program — a quid pro quo that ultimately led nowhere. The Obama administration insists that it will not cut such deals with the North to restart talks. “They made commitments over the last years to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, which they have reneged on,” Mrs. Clinton said. “They just refuse to actually do it.”

A September meeting of North Korea&#8217;s ruling party is expected to help a son of the ailing North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, consolidate his power as heir.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreasaid Saturday that its ruling Workers’ Party would hold a rare meeting of delegates in September to elect a new party leadership, a move analysts in Seoul said was intended to help a son of the ailing North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, consolidate his power as heir. The gathering will be the most important meeting of the party since it held a convention in 1980 to elect Mr. Kim to its Politburo, an event that signaled his rise to power under his father, Kim Il-sung. Saturday’s announcement, carried by the North’s state-run Korean Central News Agency, said only that the party was convening its representatives “in early September to elect its highest leading body.” South Korean intelligence authorities say they have noticed an increased effort by Mr. Kim, who reportedly suffered a stroke in 2008, to hand over power toKim Jong-un, the youngest of his three known sons. North Korea has been publicizing songs and poems implicitly praising the son, South Korea’s spy chief, Won Sei-hoon, told lawmakers on Thursday. The younger Mr. Kim is also accompanying his father on his “on-site guidance” tours of factories and military units, the South Korean news media quoted Mr. Won as telling the lawmakers in the briefing. North Korea’s economic hardships are deepening, as are its conflicts with the outside world. The North’s propaganda artists have produced 10 million copies of the younger Mr. Kim’s portrait and are waiting for an order to distribute them, said Open Radio for North Korea, a Seoul-based Web site that gathers news from sources inside the North. Every household in North Korea keeps portraits of Mr. Kim and his father, who died in 1994, hanging side by side on a wall. Although South Korean officials have identified Kim Jong-un as the likely successor since last year, most North Koreans and people outside the country know little about him. Only a few photographs that are thought to be of him are available outside North Korea, all reportedly taken when he was a teenager. He is now believed to be either 27 or 28. The impending shuffle in the party leadership follows personnel changes in the military and the powerful National Defense Commission in the past year. The North’s rubber-stamp Parliament met this month to replace several cabinet members and appointed Mr. Kim’s brother-in-law, Jang Song-taek, to the No. 2 post at the defense commission. Mr. Jang is seen as a potential caretaker for Mr. Kim’s son. The officials at the September meeting are likely to bestow key party titles on the son or install people loyal to him in important jobs to help him control the party from behind the scenes, analysts said. “We can expect a big shift” in North Korea, “with Kim Jong-un’s influence gradually eclipsing that of his father among the power elite,” said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior analyst at the Sejong Institute, a South Korean research organization.

All the Democratic Party’s reigning families were brought together around the drama of the North Korea trip.
==::==
2009-08-06T00:00:00Z

WASHINGTON — It was a gripping moment:Bill Clinton, the former president, andAl Gore, his vice president, sharing a lengthy embrace as Mr. Clinton delivered two journalists who worked for Mr. Gore back to American soil from captivity in North Korea. Thetableau at the airportin Burbank, Calif., on Wednesday morning was a visible reminder of how circumstances had conspired over the past few days to bring the reigning — and sometimes warring — names of the Democratic Party together around the drama of Mr. Clinton’s trip to North Korea. There on the tarmac were the two dominant Democrats of the 1990s, Mr. Gore and Mr. Clinton, who had played a critical role negotiating the end of an international crisis on behalf of President Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton, the secretary of state and Mr. Obama’s rival for the nomination in 2008. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore did not linger together in public on Wednesday. They have had relatively little contact after their unhappy parting nearly nine years ago, according to associates of the two men. Still, over eight years, they have both built post-White House identities and reputations that seem to have left them at peace with their shared pasts and, it would seem, with each other. “A special thanks to President Clinton,” Mr. Gore said, as Mr. Clinton gazed at him, his head nodding. “My partner and friend. So grateful.” Mike Feldman, a Democratic consultant who has worked for both men, said: “Look, they’ve both gone off and done different things. But when you work side by side as they did, that’s a pretty strong bond and that doesn’t go away. People say they don’t spend a lot of time together — well, they live in different cities.” For just a moment — even with  extra heft and grayer hair — it was easy to recall the happier and era-defining time when Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore captured the attention of the nation,campaigning in a bus caravanin 1992 as the Democratic candidates for president and vice president. On the campaign trail, and later in the White House, the two men and their spouses presented themselves as friends: Sharing a bus and jokes and warm embraces, Mr. Gore introducing Mr. Clinton at every stop on the way, feeding off each other’s riffs and energies. Still, associates of both men said, that relationship was always more pragmatic than personal, a recognition by two very ambitious men, whose similar backgrounds almost ensured a rivalry, that they had stumbled across a chemistry that could deliver them the White House. The tensions that seem to invariably sour relationships between presidents and vice presidents by the end emerged in the Clinton White House, building to the moment when Mr. Gore made clear to associates his revulsion after learning that Mr. Clinton had had an affair with an intern. Mr. Gore confronted Mr. Clinton in the Oval Office after Mr. Gore ran for president in 2000 and lost the electoral vote to George W. Bush ona ruling by the Supreme Court. In the course of a brutal one-hour exchange, aides to both men said, Mr. Gore blamed Mr. Clinton for his loss — suggesting that he had been dragged down by the burden of Mr. Clinton’s impeachment proceedings — and Mr. Clinton angrily attacked Mr. Gore for distancing himself from Mr. Clinton and his record. Mr. Gore avoided appearing with Mr. Clinton in the first years after his defeat, and was viewed in Clinton circles as implicitly supporting Mr. Obama in his competition last year with Mrs. Clinton — though one associate of Mr. Clinton said the former president was appreciative in the end that Mr. Gore had sat it out. But much of that had passed by the time Mr. Gore called Mr. Clinton 10 days ago and asked for his help. And while they have crossed paths from time to time, there has clearly been nothing like the moment on Wednesday when Mr. Gore — spotting Mr. Clinton at the top of the steps coming off the aircraft — walked forward, clapping his hands loudly, leading the audience in applause. They shook hands first, and than hugged for a full five seconds, Mr. Clinton patting his hand along Mr. Gore’s back, lingering, before Mr. Clinton went on to greet the waiting family members.

The move by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on Friday suggests the Obama administration is admitting the women’s culpability in a bid to secure their freedom.

==::==
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Friday that the United States was now seeking “amnesty” for two American journalists imprisoned inNorth Korea, a remark that suggests that the Obama administration was admitting the women’s culpability in a bid to secure their freedom. “The two journalists and their families have expressed great remorse for this incident, and I think everyone is very sorry that it happened,” Mrs. Clinton said Friday morning during a wide-ranging question-and-answer session with State Department employees. “What we hope for now is that these two young women would be granted amnesty through the North Korean system and be allowed to return home to their families as soon as possible.” The two journalists,Laura Ling, 36, andEuna Lee, 32, both reporters for San Francisco-based Current TV, were sentenced in June to 12 years of hard labor after a trial in which they were accused of entering the country illegally and committing “hostile acts.” Ms. Ling reportedly called her sister, Lisa Ling, also a journalist, this week and said in the course of a 20-minute conversation that they had broken North Korean law, but her sister did not say how. Human rights advocates in South Korea have said they were on a reporting assignment about the plight of North Korean women sold through human traffickers and refugees fleeing hunger in North Korea when they were detained March 17. Mrs. Clinton at first said the charges against the women were “baseless,” while the administration pressed for them to be freed on humanitarian grounds. Her comments on Friday appear to reflect a changing picture that has been complicated by the North’s test of a nuclear missile in May and its decision to fire seven ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan on the Fourth of July. A scholar who visited the North said in an interview published Friday in a South Korean daily that the two women were not in a prison camp, but rather in a guest house in Pyongyang, a development that seemed to suggest that the North still wanted talks with Washington on the women’s release. The scholar, Han Park, a political scientist at the University of Georgia, was quoted by the JoongAng Ilbo as saying the North Korean authorities told him the two women were “staying well in a guest house in Pyongyang.” Mrs. Clinton’s comments during a town-hall-style meeting at the State Department came in response to an employee who did not identify herself, creating the appearance that the question was planted in an attempt to send a message to North Korea. A department spokesman, P. J. Crowley, avoided questions about whether the administration had been in direct talks with North Korea. Experts said that Mrs. Clinton appeared to be trying to keep the issue of the journalists separate from the conflict over the North’s nuclear ambitions. “It’s clear to me they don’t want this tail to wag the nuclear dog,” said Michael Green, a top Asia expert for former President George W. Bush. “They are trying to keep it in a separate lane.” But Mr. Green said the North was unlikely to release the women without getting something in return. Although North Korea does not expect the Obama administration to abandon its effort to impose sanctions on the North for its recent nuclear test, he said, it is likely to want a “high-profile visit” by an administration official to demonstrate that “it’s possible to return to business as usual.” At a later appearance on Friday morning, Mrs. Clinton was asked if the State Department intended to send Professor Han as an emissary. “We have nothing to respond to about that,” she said.

Pressing forward on its nuclear weapons, the North vowed to take “military actions” against efforts to isolate it.

==::==
SEOUL, South Korea —North Korearesponded Saturday to new United Nations sanctions on Friday by defiantly vowing to press forward with the production ofnuclear weaponsand take “resolute military actions” against international efforts to isolate it. In a statement on the North’s official Korean Central News Agency, an unidentified spokesman for the North Korean Foreign Ministry was quoted as saying that his nation would continue its nuclear program to defend itself against what he called a hostile United States policy. He was quoted as saying that his nation would “weaponize” its existing plutonium stockpiles and begin a program to enrich uranium, which can also be used to make atomic warheads. The statement, which was light on the vitriol that often colors such missives, was released hours after the United Nations Security Council voted to punish the North for its May 25nuclear testand its missile tests.  The Council tightened sanctions, including an arms embargo and a provision that encourages high-seas searches of North Korean ships. “We’ll take firm military action if the United States and its allies try to isolate us,” the spokesman said, according to the KCNA, the news service. The spokesman said that his nation had “reprocessed more than one-third of our spent nuclear fuel rods.” Since the 1990s, United Nations inspectors have tried to keep track of the spent fuel rods at the Yongbyon nuclear complex; the rods can be reprocessed into weapons-grade plutonium. American intelligence officials say they believe that North Korea may have one or two nuclear weapons and has produced enough bomb-grade plutonium already for several more. The United States has also warned in the past that the North may be trying to turn its abundant supplies of natural uranium into material for weapons, but intelligence experts say they believe that such a program is years behind the country’s plutonium-based efforts. The North made similar vows about a uranium-based program in April, after a rocket test that started the latest confrontation between North Korea and the West. Although thesanctionspassed Friday tightened restrictions, the United States had hoped for more stringent penalties and for mandatory ship inspections. The Obama administration pushed for those inspections because of fears that the impoverished North would try to sell its weapons or nuclear material. North Korea has grown increasingly isolated as it has pressed forward with a nuclear program that many analysts say they now believe is aimed at producing an independent nuclear deterrent rather than being used as a bargaining chip with the West for much needed aid. The long-range missile test in April was part of what many analysts call an effort to produce a delivery system capable of reaching the United States. There have been signs in recent weeks that the North may be preparing for yet another missile test. “It has become an absolutely impossible option for the D.P.R.K. to even think about giving up its nuclear weapons,” Saturday’s statement said, using the initials of the North’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

The youngest son ofNorth Korea’s leader has been given the title of Brilliant Comrade, a newspaper reported on Friday, another sign that the Communist regime is preparing to name him as successor to its leader,Kim Jong-il. Intelligence authorities from the United States and South Korea disclosed this week thatKim Jong-un, 26, is now being referred to in the North  as Yongmyong-han Dongji. That translates roughly as Brilliant Comrade, the South Korean newspaper JoongAng Ilbo reported. The younger Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il-sung, founded North Korea in 1948. He was called the Great Leader. When he died in 1994, his son, Kim Jong-il, became Dear Leader. Kim Jong-il, 67, is believed to have suffered a stroke last year and is said to be grooming Kim Jong-un to succeed him.

Despite the failure of the attempted launch, Pyongyang’s adversaries voiced alarm and the U.N. tumbled into disarray over how to respond on Monday.

SEOUL, South Korea  — Despite the failure ofNorth Korea’s  attempt to launch a satellite, Pyongyang’s  adversaries voiced alarm on Monday over the extended range of the North’s  latest rocket, while theUnited Nationstumbled into a disarray over how to respond to what  President Obama called a “provocative act.” Washington and Seoul said the North Korean rocket launched on Sunday failed to thrust a satellite into orbit. But on Monday,  seeking to garner political gain from the test, the North Korean media praised Kim Jong-il’s leadership, insisting that a communications satellite was circling the Earth, broadcasting patriotic songs. Officials and analysts in Seoul said  the North’s rocket, identified by American officials as a Taepodong-2, flew at least 2,000 miles, doubling the range of an earlier  rocket it tested in 1998 and boosting its potential to fire a long-range missile. The impoverished country may be years away from building a truly intercontinental ballistic missile and tipping it with a nuclear warhead. But to governments grown increasingly concerned by the North’s military might, the launch was a sign that it was doggedly moving in that direction. “North Korea’s reckless act of threatening regional and global security cannot have any justification,” said President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea in a radio speech on Monday. Hours after North Korea’s missile test on Sunday, President  Obama called for new United Nations sanctions and laid out a new approach to American nuclear disarmament policy — one intended to strengthen the United States and its allies in halting proliferation. “In a strange turn of history, the threat of global nuclear war has gone down, but the risk of a nuclear attack has gone up,” Mr. Obama told a huge crowd in the square outside of Prague Castle.  “Black market trade in nuclear secrets and nuclear materials abound. The technology to build a bomb has spread.” He said the North’s testing of “a rocket that could be used for long-range missiles” illustrated “the need for action, not just this afternoon at the U.N. Security Council, but in our determination to prevent the spread of these weapons.” “Rules must be binding,” he said. “Violations must be punished. Words must mean something.” At the Security Council on Sunday,  the United States and its main allies — Japan, France and Britain —pushed for a resolution denouncing the test  as a violation of the 2006 sanctions, which demanded that North Korea suspend any activity related to the launching of ballistic missiles. Diplomats said a main issue would be determining if the failed launch violated any resolutions. “We think that what was launched is not the issue; the fact that there was a launch using ballistic missile technology is itself a clear violation,” said Susan E. Rice, the U.S. ambassador. China left its position ambiguous, although diplomats said that at the initial meeting it stressed that the North Koreans had a right like any other country to launch satellites. “Our position is that all countries concerned should show restraint and refrain from taking actions that might lead to increased tensions,” Zhang Yesui, the Chinese ambassador, told reporters. Igor N. Shcherbak, the Russian deputy envoy, said that his country did not think it was a violation of the resolutions banning ballistic missiles, but he added that Russia was still studying the matter. Mexican Ambassador Claude Heller, the council’s president, said the council would reconvene on Monday. In Tokyo, Foreign Minister Hirofumi Nakasone said: “We feel that a Security Council resolution is desirable, so we will keep trying for that.” Although the debris of the North Korean rocket fell hundreds of kilometers short of where the North had said they would land in the Pacific, “the launch carries big political and military significance,” said Jeung Young-tai, an analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul. “No country will be naive enough to believe that it was a peaceful space program,” Mr. Jeung said. “North Korea is on the threshold of becoming an intercontinental ballistic missile country.” Peter Hayes, director of the Nautilus Institute, a San Francisco-based think tank, said the main motivation behind the launch was “to demonstrate the strength and vitality of Kim Jong Il’s leadership to the military and the population, and for the scientific sector to declare its fealty to Kim Jong Il’s leadership.” Kim is expected to be re-affirmed as leader by his rubber-stamp parliament, which convenes on Thursday. The people in the tightly isolated country have little access to news from the outside world, where the satellite launch was considered a failure. When North Korea first flight-tested the Taepodong-2, in July 2006, it blew apart 40 seconds after take-off. The rocket is designed to fly at least 6,700 kilometers, or 4,200 miles, according the South Korean Defense Ministry. This time, the official KCNA news agency asserted, “storms of hurrays shook the room” as the satellite entered orbit.

North Korea has placed a long-range missile on a launch pad before a test that the U.S., Japan and South Korea said would violate a U.N. Security Council resolution, a news report said Thursday.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreahas placed a long-range missile on a launch pad before a test that the United States, Japan and South Korea said would violate a United Nations Security Council resolution, a news report said Thursday. Spy satellites detected what looked to be a Taepodong-2 missile in place Tuesday at the Musudan-ri launch site near North Korea’s northeastern coast, said Chosun Ilbo, South Korea’s leading daily, quoting an unidentified diplomatic source. Once the rocket is installed on the pad, missile experts said, the North Koreans can technically launch it within three or four days — the time needed for the fueling of a three-stage rocket. North Korea has said it would launch a rocket over Japan and the Pacific between April 4 and 8 to deliver an experimental communications satellite into orbit. But Washington, Tokyo and Seoul have said the launch is a cover for testing its Taepodong-2 ballistic missile. Both missions — the satellite and the ballistic missile — use the same rocket technology. If North Korea successfully launches its rocket, it would demonstrate that the North has the technological skills to send up a missile that could travel as far as the western United States. Washington and its allies also consider North Korea’s missile program an additional threat because the North has sold missile technology to the Middle East and is developingnuclear weaponsthat could potentially be loaded on its missiles. After North Korea detonated its first nuclear device in 2006, the Security Council adopted a resolution banning North Korea from further nuclear and missile tests. Washington warned that it would seek punishment at the Security Council — probably more sanctions on the already isolated country — if it goes ahead with the planned launch. And Japan has vowed to press for new sanctions if the rocket is tested. But North Korea warned this week that further sanctions would cause it to quit the so-called six-party talks. The United States, South Korea, Japan, China and Russia have been trying for years to persuade North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons programs in return for economic aid. The North’s defiance is the first major test for President Obama in dealing with Pyongyang. “We intend to raise this violation of the Security Council resolution, if it goes forward, in the U.N.,” U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Wednesday. “This provocative action in violation of the U.N. mandate will not go unnoticed, and there will be consequences.” South Korea fears that a launch would raise military tensions, discouraging foreign investors away from South Korea amid a global recession. Seoul also favors punishing North Korea for a rocket launching. Won Tae-je, spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry, declined to confirm the news report but said a launching would be “a serious challenge and provocation against the security on the Korean Peninsula and regional stability in Northeast Asia.” A successful launch in the first week of April would give a timely boost to the domestic reputation of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il. The country’s parliament is scheduled to convene April 9 to re-elect him as leader. Mr. Kim, 67, was reported to have suffered a stroke last August. His declining heath has raised questions about his grip on power and the future of his regime, where no clear successor has emerged. Some U.S. officials, including Adm. Timothy Keating, the head of U.S. Pacific Command, have said the United States has a capability to knock down any North Korean missile heading for U.S. territory. But such an intercept is highly unlikely, according to experts in Seoul, because Washington is trying to win the release of two television journalists North Korea recently detained. The North has charged them with illegally crossing the Chinese-North Korean border.

North Korea’s nuclear test drew protests and threats to punish the regime in Pyongyang with tighter sanctions.

PARIS — Across the globe from Washington to Moscow to Beijing,North Korea’s underground nuclear test drew condemnation and criticism on Monday and some governments  threatened  to press for tighter sanctions at the United Nations Security Council. But given the patchy record of sanctions on North Korea, it remained unclear what effect such threats might yield. Prime Minister Taro Aso of Japan said his government would seek a new United Nations resolution to condemn the test. He said an urgent meeting of the Security Council was expected to be held on Monday in New York at Japan’s request. China, whose response was closely watched around the world, said it was “resolutely opposed” to the test, according to a  Foreign Ministry  statement carried by the official Xinhua news agency. China is by far North Korea’s largest trading partner and wields critical diplomatic influence. Russia said the test breached a United Nations Security Council resolution and would “endanger security and stability in the region,” according to the Russian Foreign Ministry in a statement. President Obama was among the first to register protest, saying in a statement that “North Korea is directly and recklessly challenging the international community.” The statement continued: “Such provocations will only serve to deepen North Korea’s isolation. It will not find international acceptance unless it abandons its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.” Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he believed the latest series of tests “just speak to the growing belligerence on the part of North Korea,” The Associated Press reported. Appearing on NBC’s “Today” show on Monday, Admiral Mullen said described North Korea as a country that “continues to destabilize that region and in the long term should they continue to develop anuclear weaponsprogram, poses a grave threat to the United States.” European governments joined the call for Security Council action and said North Korea would not gain international acceptance as long as it followed policies that Prime Minister Gordon Brown ofBritaindescribed as “erroneous, misguided and a danger to the world.” The French Foreign Ministry said in a statement: “France will consult in the coming hours with its partners on the Security Council and in the region on the consequences to draw from this serious act by North Korea, and in particular on strengthening sanctions.” Germany also condemned the test. Several European foreign ministers were heading for a meeting in Hanoi with their Asian counterparts when news of the test broke. Carl Bildt, Sweden’s minister of foreign affairs, called the development “alarming.” Javier Solana, the foreign policy chief of the European Union, said in Brussels that the “irresponsible acts by North Korea warrant a firm response.” After the North’s first nuclear test in October 2006, a United Nations Security Council resolution, drafted by the United States, banned trade with North Korea in materials linked with unconventional weapons, and authorized countries to inspect cargo going into and out of the North. It also sought to outlaw international travel and freeze the overseas assets of people associated with the North’s weapons programs. But doubts about the sanctions arose when South Korea and China indicated that business and economic relations would be largely unaffected. In April 2009, North Korea defied the United States, China and a series of United Nations resolutions by launching a rocket that the country said was designed to propel a satellite into space. Much of the world viewed the test as an effort to prove it is edging toward the capability to shoot a nuclear warhead on a longer-range missile. Following the launch, the Security Council decided unanimously last month to tighten sanctions against North Korea. The White House asked the United Nations sanctions committee to develop a list of North Korean companies to be singled out, focusing on companies involved in missile and nuclear technology. But some analysts said they doubted that these measures would prove effective. They noted that China opposed a stronger United Nations response to the April missile launching. On the Korean peninsula on Monday , news of the test caused an initial drop on South Korean markets, where the benchmark Kospi index plummeted by up to 6.3 per cent before recovering almost all of its losses. The won fell against the dollar but also recovered. The government in Seoul called the North Korean underground test a “direct threat against the peace and stability in the region as well as to the world.” Australia offered “absolute condemnation” and New Zealand expressed worries about the test, as did India. “India is against nuclear proliferation,” India’s Defense Minister A.K. Antony said in New Delhi, The A.P. reported. “It’s a matter of very serious concern not only to India, but to the world.”

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreahas told international aviation and maritime authorities that it will launch a satellite in early April,  the North’s official news agency  and a news agency in  the  South reported  on Thursday. North Korea’s neighbors and Western nations believe the launching is actually cover for testing a long-range missile  capable of reaching the American mainland. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has  said such a  launching would be “very unhelpful.” The North’s state-run Korea Central News Agency said the country notified the international organizations to “ensure the safety of flights and sea vessels.” It did not disclose a date. But  South Korea’s  Yonhap news agency, quoting unidentified  government sources, said the North had told the international organizations that the launching would be between April 4 and 8.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreahas been moving what appear to be components of a long-range missile to a launching site, a South Korean official and news reports said Tuesday, raising fears that it might test-fire a missile. The North Korean move, first reported by the South Korean news agency Yonhap and the Japanese newspaper Sankei Shimbun, came amid concern among political analysts in Seoul, South Korea’s capital, that the North might also try some sort of military provocation to help make its nuclear program a foreign policy priority for the Obama administration. North Korea has launched missiles in the past to win political or economic concessions. In recent weeks, it has said that its military had assumed an “all-out confrontational posture” and that it had scrapped all nonaggression pacts with South Korea. In Washington, a State Department spokesman, Robert A. Wood, said he could not comment on the reports, calling them “an intelligence matter.” But he added: “North Korea’s missile activities and missile programs are of concern to the region. A ballistic missile launch by North Korea would be unhelpful and, frankly, provocative.” Recent spy satellite images showed a train carrying a long, cylindrical object, believed to be a missile, heading to a new launching site on North Korea’s western coast, Yonhap reported, quoting an unidentified government official. But in another dispatch late Tuesday, Yonhap said that intelligence officials were still tracking the train and that there was a possibility that the North would take it to another launching site. A South Korean government official reached Tuesday confirmed the train’s movement, as cited by Yonhap. “We detected such a movement in the last week of January,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue with reporters. The object is believed to be a Taepodong-2 missile, Yonhap said. The missile is designed to fly at least 4,200 miles, far enough to reach North America, and carry a payload of 1,400 to 2,200 pounds, according to the South Korean Defense Ministry. North Korea test-fired the missile in July 2006. But it was considered a failure, with its rocket fizzling out shortly after it blasted off. While not ruling out the possibility of a missile test, analysts and officials in Seoul  said that the North often “puts on a show” at its military facilities to stir up uncertainty among its neighbors.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge has awarded more than $65 million to several men of the Navy spy ship Pueblo, who were captured and tortured byNorth Koreain 1968. The judge, Henry H. Kennedy Jr. of Federal District Court, issued the judgment against North Korea on Tuesday. North Korea did not respond to the lawsuit, which accused it of kidnapping, imprisonment and torture. Four former crewmen of the Pueblo filed the suit in 2006. The Pueblo was seized off North Korea on Jan. 23, 1968, while it was on an intelligence-gathering mission. North Korea says the ship was inside its coastal zone. Navy records say it was in international waters. One crew member was killed in the attack, and 10 were wounded. The crewmen were held captive for 11 months.

North Korea on Sunday welcomed the move and said that it would resume disabling its nuclear weapons facilities.

WASHINGTON — The Bush administration announced Saturday that it had removedNorth Koreafrom a list of state sponsors of terrorism in a bid to salvage a fragile nuclear deal that seemed on the verge of collapse. Sean McCormack, the State Department spokesman, said that the United States made the decision after North Korea agreed to resume disabling a plutonium plant and to allow some inspections to verify that it had halted its nuclear program as promised months earlier. The deal, which the Bush administration had portrayed as a major foreign policy achievement, began slipping away in recent weeks in a dispute over the verification program. Just days ago, North Korea barred international inspectors from the plant. The decision to remove North Korea from the terror list was a dramatic moment for President Bush, who had called the country part of an “axis of evil” and had only reluctantly ordered administration officials to engage in negotiations, saying that the United States had made deals with the nation’s leaders before without winning enough concessions. That calculus changed in 2006, when North Korea exploded a nuclear device. But Mr. Bush is already having trouble selling the new agreement to his own party. Republican lawmakers, including the presidential nominee, Senator John McCain, quickly expressed concern, complaining that North Korea had yet to demonstrate that it was serious about adhering to its commitment to denuclearize. Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee for president, called the deal “a modest step forward” in dismantlingNorth Korea’s nuclear weaponsprogram. Other Democrats said they welcomed the agreement but noted that it did not go much beyond an agreement President Clinton reached with North Korea in 1994, which the Bush administration, including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, criticized as inadequate. Bush administration officials, trying to head off potential criticism that they were simply seeking a foreign policy victory in their last months, said the agreement was the best the United States could get at this time. Ms. Rice “very strongly feels that it is our own responsibility, until Jan. 20, 2009, to act as good stewards of the national interest,” Mr. McCormack said during a news conference. In the most significant part of the accord announced Saturday, North Korea agreed to a verification plan that would allow United States inspectors access to its main declared nuclear compound, at Yongbyon; international inspectors have worked at the site on and off for years. But the deal puts off decisions on the thorniest verification issue: what would happen if international experts suspected the North was hiding other nuclear weapons facilities, particularly those related to uranium enrichment. The United States wanted the North to agree to inspections at sites that raised suspicions, but North Korea balked. The new agreement calls for United States inspectors to be granted access to such sites “based on mutual consent” with North Korea. Experts on North Korea say that the concession by the United States was probably necessary to achieve a deal, but that it no doubt will lead to future fights, since the North’s leaders will not want to give inspectors free rein to travel the country. Patricia A. McNerney, one of the State Department negotiators, acknowledged that issue would probably lead to a hornets’ nest of problems. “Going into verification with North Korea will not be easy, we know that,” she said. “This is the most secret and opaque regime in the world.” North Korea on Sunday welcomed its removal from Washington's terrorism blacklist and said that it would resume disabling its nuclear weapons facilities, allowing American and United Nations monitors back into its main nuclear complex. South Korea and Japan also hailed the agreement on Sunday. But hawkish politicians in Washington's two main Asian allies, as well as relatives of people allegedly kidnapped by the Communist state, accused the United States of giving in to the North's bad behavior. "We are extremely disappointed with the United States, which we had believed would be a pillar of anti-terrorism and human rights," said Choi Sung Yong, 56, head of the Abductees' Family Union, which includes relatives of hundreds of South Koreans, mostly fishermen, allegedly abducted to the North. Relatives of the South Korean and Japanese abductees have counted on Bush to use the terrorism blacklist as leverage to pressure the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, to return their missing family members. North Korea, which has long sought international acceptance, had been pushing hard to get off the terror list. But Mr. McCormack made clear on Saturday that North Korea is still subject to numerous economic sanctions. The agreement follows weeks of intense negotiations and high-stakes brinkmanship, as North Korea, furious that the Bush administration had not removed it from the terrorism list as it agreed last summer, threatened to restart its plutonium-based weapons program and barred international inspectors from the Yongbyon plant. In Washington, State Department proponents of the deal, including Ms. Rice and her top North Korea envoy, Christopher R. Hill, battled critics inside and outside the administration who castigated them for trying to salvage the accord. The administration has been at war with itself over whether to go ahead with the North Korea pact despite objections from critics in the office of Vice President Dick Cheney, and even some members of the State Department’s verification and compliance office. That rift spilled into the open at the news conference on Saturday, when a reporter asked Paula A. DeSutter, the assistant secretary of state for verification, compliance and implementation, how she responded to criticism of the deal from John R. Bolton, her former boss at the State Department. Ms. DeSutter did not defend the accord, saying simply, “John is the epitome of a skeptical policymaker, and that’s appropriate.” Despite the internal fights, Ms. Rice convinced President Bush last week that this was the best the administration could get in its remaining time in office. But as late as Friday, things remained up in the air, said one administration official, who, like several other officials and diplomats interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the issue. Another senior administration official described the internal deliberations as a “close call.” Senator McCain said in a statement that he would not support the deal until he got some questions answered. “I expect the administration to explain exactly how this new verification agreement advances American interests and those of our allies,” he said. He added that he was “concerned that this latest agreement appears to have been reached between Washington and Pyongyang, and only then discussed with our Asian allies in an effort to garner their support.” Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Republican of Florida, issued a statement strongly criticizing the deal. “I am profoundly disappointed,” she said. “By rewarding North Korea before the regime has carried out its commitments, we are encouraging this regime to continue its illicit nuclear program and violate its pledge to no longer provide nuclear assistance to extremist regimes.” Two of the Bush administration’s main criticisms of the 1994 accord were that it did not mandate the removal of nuclear material from North Korea and that international inspectors were limited to  Yongbyon. The 1994 accord collapsed in 2002 after the Bush administration accused North Korea of circumventing the agreement by pursuing a second path to a bomb, based on enriching uranium. The White House said at the time that it would require full verification that any uranium program had been halted, though later the intelligence community expressed some doubts about how far the program had gotten. Although the new agreement leaves open the possibility of future inspections outside Yongbyon, it leaves vague what mechanism would be used to determine the status of a uranium program. The North has agreed in principle to give up its nuclear material and any weapons, but that seems almost certain to be subject to negotiations with the next president. During the Bush administration, North Korea is believed to have produced enough bomb-grade plutonium for six or more nuclear weapons. Bush administration officials have been consulting about the latest deal with its partners in the so-called “six-party” talks, the group including Russia, South Korea and Japan that negotiated the agreement in 2007 for the North to halt its nuclear activities. Diplomats said that Japan had expressed reservations about removing North Korea from the terror list because the North still had not addressed all of their concerns about abductions of Japanese citizens decades ago. After the official announcement on Saturday, Japan’s finance minister, Shoichi Nakagawa, called the American decision “extremely regrettable.” South Korea has been more supportive. “We welcome the agreement because we believe this will help put the six-party negotiations back on track and eventually lead to the dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear programs,” said Kim Sook, South Korea’s main nuclear envoy, during a news conference in Seoul on Sunday. The South Korean foreign minister, Yu Myung-hwan, had stressed Friday that if the six-party negotiations fell apart now, the next administration would have difficulty restarting them. Gary Samore, a nonproliferation expert in the Clinton administration, characterized the deal as probably the best that could be gotten at this time, but warned of stormy times to come. “Every agreement you ever have with the North Koreans always contains certain ambiguities, and that ends up being the basis for which you have the next round of talks,” he said. “It’s always two steps forward and one step back.” For instance, he said, besides the issue of access to suspected nuclear sites, the United States and North Korea appear to have fudged the critical issue of whether American inspectors will be allowed to take all the samples they want out of the country to foreign laboratories for inspection. According to a fact sheet issued by the Bush administration, the two sides agreed “on the use of scientific procedures, including sampling and forensic activities,” although the sheet doesn’t say where those tests would be done. Mr. Bolton, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations under Mr. Bush, said that the Bush administration had “punted” the hardest issue, that of inspections beyond declared nuclear sites. “This means that North Korea has a veto over everything beyond Yongbyon,” he said, “so that’s a clear victory for North Korea.”

The Bush administration is dispatching Christopher Hill to Pyongyang in a last-ditch effort to rescue an accord leading to the country’s nuclear disarmament.

WASHINGTON  — The Bush administration is dispatching its chiefNorth Koreanegotiator, Christopher Hill, to Pyongyang this week in a last-ditch effort to rescue what the White House had hoped would be a singular foreign policy achievement: an accord leading to the country’s nuclear disarmament. The rapid decision to send Mr. Hill to the North Korean capital, days after North Korea broke the seals thatUnited Nationsinspectors placed on its equipment and said it was restarting a facility to manufacture bomb-grade plutonium, seemed to underscore the administration’s desperation to restore an accord that took most of President Bush’s second term to negotiate and implement. Mr. Hill, one administration official said, is “flying blind,” hoping to get a previous agreement back on track. The fact that Mr. Hill is going to Pyongyang at all shows how much has changed in the administration. In his first term. Mr. Bush refused to talk to the country, and American strategy was to hasten North Korea’s economic collapse. But the country refused to buckle, and sped ahead with its nuclear enrichment facility. In more recent years, the administration argued for months about whether to allow Mr. Hill to participate in direct talks with the North Koreans, particularly in Pyongyang. His efforts to go there were repeatedly blocked by hard-liners who argued that to show up in North Korea would be to reward the government there. But if there were any such arguments this time, they appear to have been brief. The United States must decide in the next month or two whether to continue sending oil shipments to North Korea; before it cuts them off, officials say, Mr. Hill wanted to make a direct appeal to the North Korean leadership. But it is not clear who is controlling the country, after reports PresidentKim Jong-ilsuffered a stroke.

The program was vulnerable to manipulation by the North Korean government, the panel said.
==::==
2008-01-25T00:00:00Z
==::==
WASHINGTON — A Senate subcommittee criticized the United Nations Development Program inNorth Koreaon Thursday, accusing it of lax management and poor accountability. But the panel raised serious questions over accusations by the United States Mission to the United Nations that the agency had squandered millions of dollars there. The panel, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, concluded that the program depended excessively on staff members chosen by the North Korean government, that it broke its own rules in using foreign currency rather than local currency, and that it lacked sufficient administrative and fiscal controls and resisted auditing. In a report, the subcommittee cited general “management and operational deficiencies” as leaving the agency “vulnerable to manipulation by the North Korean government.” The program shut its operations in North Korea in March when the country resisted a decision by the development program to stop furnishing payments in hard currency and to stop making local hiring subject to government approval. But much of the hearing on Thursday focused on charges made last year by Mark D. Wallace, an ambassador at the United States mission to the United Nations, in briefings for members of Congress, news outlets, the State Department and nations that finance the development program. Mr. Wallace said then that $2.8 million of program funds had been sent to North Korean missions abroad for the purchase of buildings in Britain, France and Canada; that $2.7 million had been paid to a North Korean financial agent responsible for sales of missiles and arms; and that more than $7 million had been transferred to a North Korean committee it worked with. Mr. Wallace compared the program to the scandal-ridden oil-for-food program in Iraq and suggested that the United Nations money might have ended up financing the North Korean nuclear program. The subcommittee staff report on Thursday said that in fact the $2.8 million sent abroad to buy real estate was actually North Korean, not United Nations, money, and that the amount of money sent to the company suspected of financing arms was $52,000, not $2.7 million. It also accepted the program’s explanation that the link to arms sales of the suspect contact, the Macao-based Zang Lock Trading Company, had not been known at the time. The report said the North Korean representatives had told the committee that their government used a United Nations bank reference as a way of avoiding detection at a time in 2002 when the country had just been labeled by President Bush as a part of the “axis of evil” and feared its power to transfer funds abroad would be restricted. The United Nations had no knowledge of the transaction, the report said. At the hearing the chairman, Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, pressed Mr. Wallace repeatedly to say whether, with what he knew now, he could still make the same charges he had made last year. Mr. Wallace said that he did not know the specific amounts of money involved because of the difficulty of tracking transactions in North Korea, and added that they could be even higher than he had estimated. In an interview outside the hearing room, Mr. Levin expressed frustration at the answer. “I gave him a chance on at least three occasions to acknowledge that some of the points that he made back in May were inaccurate at the time, perhaps based on information that he interpreted, but that nonetheless, he could not make those statements now,” Mr. Levin said. “That doesn’t mean he lied,” Mr. Levin added. “It does mean that he said things at the time that he now knows are not accurate.” In a separate interview, Mr. Wallace said he could not answer the question under oath because he was uncertain about the real figures, and he suggested the committee had been naïve in its conclusions. Disputing the subcommittee’s finding that the $2.8 million sent abroad did not belong to the United Nations Development Program, he said: “The documents say it’s the U.N. imprimatur money. The North Koreans and now the U.N.D.P. say, ‘Well, maybe those documents are not accurate.’ “I didn’t make those documents, the North Koreans did, and they want us to believe it is not U.N. money. If you want to give them the benefit of the doubt, I would submit that I have a bridge for you in Manhattan that I’d sell you for $2.7 million.” The ranking Republican on the committee, Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota, said he thought the United Nations in North Korea had a “keep your wallets open and your mouths shut attitude to the rest of the world.” He said the conduct of the program showed “how rogue regimes try to manipulate the U.N. as much as they can,” adding, “If they were able to use U.N.D.P. as a cover to funnel money, what other rogue nations were able to subvert the system?”
