SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreahas proposed military talks withSouth Koreato discuss border disputes, the South Korean Defense Ministry said on Thursday, in another sign that the North is reaching out to its rival after months of acrimony. North Korea on Wednesday proposed working-level military talks to discuss preventing naval clashes along the disputed western sea border, ministry officials said. Another topic the North said it wanted to discuss was leaflets sent across the border by South Korean activists that urged North Koreans to rise up against their leader, Kim Jong-il. Relations between the Koreas have cooled since President Lee Myung-bak took office in Seoul in early 2008. They deteriorated further after a South Korean warship, theCheonan,sank in Marchnear the disputed border, in what Seoul and Washington say was a North Korean torpedo attack. Forty-six sailors were killed. The North denied the accusation and demonstrated its displeasure byfiring artillery in the border waters. In recent weeks, however, the North has made some conciliatory gestures. It freed the crew of aseized South Korean fishing boatandoffered to resume reunionsof families separated by the Korean War. Officials from the Koreas were scheduled to meet on Friday to discuss the reunions. South Korea has welcomed the moves and responded byoffering humanitarian aidfor the victims of severe floods in North Korea. The military talks, if they are held, will be the first in almost two years. But the government in Seoul remains wary of what it considers the North Korean tactic of following up provocative acts with offers of talks to win concessions. “Taking into consideration that North Korea has not admitted to or apologized for sinking the Cheonan, the government is reviewing the North’s proposal cautiously,” the Defense Ministry said in a statement. On Wednesday, Kim Tae-hyo, a senior policy adviser to President Lee, reaffirmed that South Korea would withhold large-scale aid until North Korea apologized for the sinking. North Korea, according to some accounts, needs outside aid after extensive damage from the floods further strained its already moribund economy at a time when Kim Jong-il is said to be preparing one of his sons to inherit the leadership. Without explanation, North Korea appears to havepostponed a major gatheringof delegates of the ruling Workers’ Party, the first such meeting in decades, that it had said it would convene in early September. There had been speculation that Mr. Kim would use the meeting to establish his son Kim Jong-un as the country’s future leader. The so-called Northern Limit Line — a western maritime sea border drawn unilaterally by the United Nations Command at the end of the Korean War but never accepted by the North — has been the scene ofthree naval clashesin the past 11 years. On Thursday, officers from North Korea and the United Nations Command met on the border in their fifth session since the Cheonan affair. They discussed the timing and agenda for talks on armistice issues related to the sinking.

Two alleged North Korean agents were arrested while on a mission to assassinate the highest-ranking North Korean defector in the South, South Korean officials said.

SEOUL, South Korea — South Korean security officials said Wednesday that they had arrested two North Korean agents who had posed as defectors in a plot to assassinate the highest-ranking North Korean defector by slitting his throat. The defector, Hwang Jang-yop, a former North Korean Workers’ Party secretary, has bitterly criticized the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, since his defection in 1997. Mr. Hwang tutored Mr. Kim and helped create the country’s ruling philosophy of juche, or national self-reliance. Mr. Hwang, now 87, lives at a secret site inSouth Koreaunder  police protection. He occasionally emerges to give a speech or a lecture, as he did recently in Washington and Tokyo, and his talks are typically replete with biting assessments of Mr. Kim and the North Korean government. North Koreahas called Mr. Hwang a traitor and “human scum.” He has received several death threats, including a package sent anonymously in 2006 that contained an ax stuck to his picture and splashed with red paint. The package was sent to a South Korean radio station that carried Mr. Hwang’s speeches. On April 5,Uriminzokkiri,  a Web site run by the North Korean government, warned Mr. Hwang: “You must not forget that traitors have always been slaughtered with knives.” The men said to be North Korean agents, identified by officials as Kim Myong-ho and Dong Myong-gwan, arrived in South Korea early this year, traveling through China and Thailand and pretending to be defectors, said Oh Se-in, a deputy chief prosecutor in Seoul who oversaw the investigation with the National Intelligence Service, the main government spy agency. Each year, thousands of North Koreans arrive in South Korea after fleeing  the North. Mr. Oh said the two agents, both 36, were army majors attached to the General Bureau of Surveillance, the North’s main army intelligence agency. Their mission, he said in a telephone interview, was to track Mr. Hwang’s whereabouts and “cut his throat because he was a thorn in the eye of the North.” “They said they were ready to commit suicide once their assassination mission was completed,” Mr. Oh said. “This case shows that North Korea is still plotting terrorism while giving lip service to exchanges and cooperation with the South.” South Korean officials said they caught the men during routine debriefings of defectors from the North. But the formal arrests on Tuesday and the timing of the announcement were notable. The South Korean authorities briefed local news outlets about the arrests late Tuesday, only hours after President Lee Myung-bak  delivered unusually harsh criticisms of North Korea’s leaders. On Wednesday morning, the major South Korean daily newspapers carried nearly identical articles on the arrests. Opposition politicians raised concerns that the arrests would stir fears of North Korea as a way to rally conservative voters ahead of elections  in June. In the past, conservative governments have been accused of stoking such fears during election years. Prosecutors said their investigation had nothing to do with domestic politics. Suspicion continues to grow that a South Korean Navy ship, whichsanknear the disputed border with the North, may have been hit by a North Korean torpedo. Mr. Leetearfully vowedthis week to find the cause of the sinking.North Korea has denied any involvement. The plot against Mr. Hwang, if confirmed, would not be the first such attempt by the North to kill a prominent defector. South Korea said that Lee Han-young, a nephew of a former wife of Kim Jong-il who defected to Seoul through Switzerland in 1982, was shot and killed by North Korean agents in  Seoul in 1997. Mr. Lee was a bitter critic of the North and had revealed embarrassing details about Mr. Kim.  During recent lectures and interviews in Washington and Tokyo, Mr. Hwang called Mr. Kim “a dictator 10 times worse than Kim Il-sung,” Mr. Kim’s father and the founder of the modern North Korean state. Mr. Hwang has said the government has abused the principles of the juche philosophy and driven the North into isolation and poverty. “They call me a traitor, but the real traitor is Kim Jong-il, who let his people starve and die,” Mr. Hwang told  the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun. In a lecture in Washington on March 31, Mr. Hwang said that Mr. Kim — during a drinking party — once ordered his military to attack a South Korean guard post because he was “bored by the silence along the border,” the South Korean newspaper JoongAng Ilbo reported. Such provocations were aimed at increasing Mr. Kim’s leverage in negotiations with the South, Mr. Hwang said. The case brought fresh attention to the North’s General Bureau of Surveillance, which was created in February 2009 through a merger of three party and military spy agencies. The two agents in custody told prosecutors that the bureau’s chief, Lt. Gen. Kim Yong-chol, personally assigned them to the assassination mission last November.

SEOUL, South Korea — A South Korean Navy patrol ship sank near the disputed western maritime border withNorth Koreaearly Saturday after suffering damage to its hull,South Korea’s military said. The sinking immediately raised suspicions about the possible involvement of North Korea, whose navy has skirmished with South Korean ships in the waters off the Korean Peninsula. But South Korean officials said it was not clear whether the ship had been attacked by the North. South Korea’s president, Lee Myung-bak, ordered an emergency meeting of security-related cabinet ministers at an underground bunker at his office, the Blue House, in Seoul, and he ordered the military to focus on rescue efforts, according to South Korean news reports. “It is premature at this stage to discuss the cause of the sinking,” said a presidential spokeswoman, Kim Eun-hye. “It has not been determined whether this incident is related to North Korea.” By early Saturday morning, 58 of the ship’s 104 crew members had been rescued, Commodore Lee Ki-shik of the South Korean Navy said during a news briefing. More navy ships were headed to the scene to assist in the rescue efforts. The commodore did confirm reports in the South Korean news media that another South Korean ship had fired warning shots around the time the first ship was damaged after detecting an unidentified object on its radar. He cautioned that the object could have been a flock of birds. “All we can say for now is that one of our patrol ships is sinking after it suffered a rupture in its bottom created by an unidentified cause,” said a spokesman at the South Korean Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because South Korea had not made a formal announcement. The ship was in the Yellow Sea near  Baengnyeong, a South Korean island eight miles from the North Korean coast and 120 miles from the South Korean mainland. The waters in the disputed western sea near the two Koreas make up the most volatile section of the border between North and South Korea and were the site of naval clashes in 1999 and 2002. North Korea rejects a maritime border unilaterally drawn by the United Nations at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War and defended by the South Koreans. In November, naval patrol boats from the North and South exchanged fire after a North Korean boat crossed that sea border, called the northern-limit line.

The rare gesture from North Korea came after six South Koreans were killed when water released from a dam in the North swept down a river.

SEOUL,South Korea— In a potential breakthrough in its relations with the South,North Koreaexpressed regret on Wednesday over thedeaths of six South Koreanswho were killed when water released from a dam swept south down a river. North Korea opened the dam without warning last month, setting off flash floods that killed six South Koreans fishing or camping on the Imjin River, which flows into South Korea. North Korea had said an emergency forced it to open the dam, but the South demanded an apology. An expression of regret, although it fell short of a formal apology, was highly unusual, and South Korea took it as a signal that the North wanted to improve ties. The North’s attitude was being closely watched on Wednesday because the inter-Korean meeting came two days after the North  test-fired five short-range missiles and amid reports that it might test more missiles. “It was regrettable that unintended human casualties occurred,” a North Korean delegate told South Korean officials during the meeting at a North Korean border town on Wednesday. The North also offered condolences to the bereaved families, the Unification Ministry in Seoul said. South Korea was pressing the North to agree to a joint flood-control system to prevent similar episodes. “We see this as an expression of North Korean intentions to improve ties with us,” said Park Sun-kyoo, a presidential spokesman in Seoul. “This is a very positive signal.” Recently, there have been indications that North Korea is ready to return to six-nation nuclear disarmament talks with South Korea, the United States, China, Japan and Russia. Analysts say they believe that North Korea is mixing provocative moves with conciliatory gestures as a tactic to draw the United States and South Korea to the negotiating table, where it has used its nuclear and missile threats to extract aid in the past. On a visit to Beijing on Wednesday,Kurt M. Campbell, the American assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said that China and the United States were working closely to draw North Korea back to nuclear disarmament talks. This month, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China met Kim Jong-il, the North Korean leader, in Pyongyang, the North’s capital. Mr. Kim reportedly told Mr. Wen that his government would return to six-nation talks if it first saw progress in bilateral contacts with Washington. Mr. Campbell reaffirmed Wednesday that Washington would not meet directly with North Korea until Mr. Kim’s government committed to rejoining the talks, adding that there were positive signs that it would.

Kim Jong-il has apparently chosen Kim Jong-un, his youngest son, to succeed him as North Korea’s leader, South Korea’s main intelligence agency said.
==::==
2009-06-03T00:00:00Z
==::==
This article was reported byDavid E. Sanger,Mark MazzettiandChoe Sang-hunand written by Mr. Sanger. WASHINGTON — American and South Korean officials say thatKim Jong-il, the North Korean dictator recovering from a stroke, appears to have designated his youngest son as his successor. Mr. Kim may have ordered the country’s second nuclear test last week in hopes of leaving his son in control of a country that has cemented its status as a nuclear-weapons state. Little is known about the youngest son,Kim Jong-un, beyond reports that he was secretly schooled in Switzerland under an assumed name, posing as the son of a driver in the nearby North Korean Embassy. He skied Switzerland’s famous slopes, and was a fan of Michael Jordan. But his path to power is hardly assured: some intelligence officials believe that everyone from the North Korean military to Kim Jong-il’s eldest son may be plotting behind the scenes to derail the succession plans, andNorth Korea’s last ally, China, is reportedly deeply uncomfortable with the thought of a third-generation family dynasty, unique among Communist nations. As always in watching a state virtually sealed off from the outside world, analysts acknowledge that they are extrapolating from indicators, rather than hard evidence. Even Kim Jong-un’s age is uncertain; he is believed to be in his mid-20s. In recent weeks, North Korean diplomats abroad have been told to begin to pay homage to Kim Jong-un and some schoolchildren have reportedly been including his name in their songs. His rise comes at the expense of his 38-year-old brother, Kim Jong-nam, best known for the moment when he was caught slipping into Japan on a false passport, on his way to Tokyo Disneyland. In preliminary assessments of the May 25 underground nuclear test, top officials of the Obama administration say they believe it was linked to the power jockeying in Pyongyang more than any attempt to force President Obama into more negotiations in which North Korea tries to trade away its nuclear ability for American energy and security concessions. “There was a sense that every North Korean escalation was intended as a bargaining chip,” said one senior administration official involved in the assessments. “Now there’s an alternative view taking hold: that Kim Jong-il wants to force the world to acknowledge it as a nuclear power before he dies. And we’re not going to do that.” Mr. Obama has sent James B. Steinberg, the deputy secretary of state, and other senior officials to Japan,South Koreaand China this week to attempt a unified response to the test, focusing on inspecting all sea and air traffic moving in and out of North Korea that could be carrying nuclear or missile technology, according to an administration official. But it is a risky move, one that could leave Mr. Obama facing a possible military confrontation with the North  as he increases troop levels in Afghanistan. The most delicate issue is whether China will back the inspection of some North Korean vessels, which the North has already warned it would consider an act of war. The inspections were authorized, but not enforced, under a United Nations resolution passed after the North’s first nuclear test, in 2006. A senior administration official said Tuesday that Chinese officials feared that if North Korea gained the ability to fit itsnuclear weaponsatop its long-range missiles, the United States would increase its military presence in the Pacific and Japan could reconsider its ban on its own nuclear weapons. But if the Chinese press too hard, the official said, “they risk unintentionally causing collapse in North Korea and instability” on their own border. The official spoke at a forum on Tuesday under rules that he not be quoted by name. While Obama administration officials say they want to draw North Korea back into disarmament talks begun by President George W. Bush, they are not interested in negotiating yet another deal to disable the main nuclear facility at Yongbyon, where North Korea produces its bomb-grade plutonium. “The real challenge is to avoid a repetition of the past,” one senior administration official said. Obama administration officials acknowledge that negotiations with the North may be all but impossible at a moment when it is unclear who is running the country and when all players in a succession struggle will avoid any perception of concessions to the United States. There is no indication yet that the heir apparent has been involved in decisions about the nuclear program. The current leader, Kim Jong-il, has three known sons. The eldest, Kim Jong-nam, was once considered the leading candidate to succeed his father, until the Disneyland episode  added to rumors that his judgment was less than reliable. Kim Jong-nam is widely reported to have voracious appetites for alcohol and women, and his father apparently grew concerned that North Korea’s generals would never accept him, according to a former American intelligence official. The North Korean leader’s middle son, Kim Jong-chol, 28, was another possibility, but Kenji Fujimoto, who once served as Kim Jong-il’s sushi chef, wrote in a memoir that Kim Jong-il dismissed that son as “girlish,” suggesting that he would not stand up to the West. By default, that left Kim Jong-un. On Tuesday, South Korean lawmakers said they had been briefed by the country’s intelligence agency, and told he was the heir apparent. The intelligence agency intercepted messages to North Korean overseas missions a few days after the May 25 nuclear test, according to reports in Seoul. “Our intelligence service has been following the matter for some time,” said Song Young-gil, an opposition lawmaker briefed by the intelligence agency. “They said that this message instructed the diplomats to pledge their allegiance to Kim Jong-un.” Another lawmaker, Moon Kook-hyun, said he could not comment on a secret briefing but agreed that Kim Jong-un had been designated the successor. The intelligence agency declined to confirm the reports. Inside the North, the subject is only whispered about. “I never thought that Kim Jong-il was human and thus mortal,” said Oh Yeon-jong, a defector who arrived in Seoul in 2004. “We didn’t know, didn’t talk about how many children he had, how many wives he had. I heard about them only when I arrived here.” It also is not  clear if a society that reveres seniority would accept such a young leader, and American officials are waiting for the next steps. One test could be the response of Gen. O Kuk-ryol, the National Defense Commission’s vice chairman. Intelligence officials say they believe he would need to give his blessing to the transfer of power in Pyongyang. The general has taken greater control in recent years over the regime’s military and security policy. Analysts are also watching Jang Seong-taek, Kim Jong-il’s brother-in-law, who is believed to run many day-to-day state affairs on behalf of the ailing leader. In any case, the outside world will be transfixed. At the C.I.A., the youngest son’s picture used to be posted in the Asia division, and analysts gave him the moniker of “the Cute Leader” — a play on his father’s status as “Dear Leader” and his grandfather’s as “Great Leader.”

The move was the latest sign of escalating tensions after North Korea conducted its second nuclear test on Monday.
==::==

SEOUL,South Korea— One day afterNorth Koreawarned of a possible   attack against the South, the United States and South Korea ordered their forces here  to  their highest alert for three years, increasing  surveillance flights and satellite reconnaissance to counter what officials termed a “grave threat.” The move was the latest sign of escalating   tensions on the Korean peninsula after North Korea conducted its second nuclear test on Monday, sparking a confrontation with South Korea and the international community that has built into ever more bellicose rhetoric. North Korea reinforced its menacing language by test-firing six short-range missiles earlier in the week. The South Korean Defense Ministry said allied troops, including, 28,000 U.S. soldiers based in South Korea, raised their Watch Condition, or Watchcon, to the second-highest level from Watchcon 3 to Watchcon 2. South Korea has put its military on such a high level of alert only five times since hostilities in the three-year Korean War ended in an armistice in 1953, most recently when North Korea conducted its first nuclear test in October 2006. The upgraded alert  provides for  a significant increase in the use of reconnaissance planes and spy satellites, as well as a more vigorous gathering and analysis of electronic signals from the North, ministry officials said. The Defense Ministry declined to confirm South Korean news reports that its military has moved or planned to move warships and artillery to islands near the western sea border with North Korea. But a South Korean military official said that in recent months, North Korea has increased training exercises among  its coastal artillery units opposite the South Korean islands. The North’s state-controlled media warned on Thursday that “even a minor accidental clash could lead to nuclear war.” “It’s a matter of time when a fuse for war is triggered,” the North Korean government’s official newspaper, Minju Joseon, said in a commentary carried by the state-run news agency KCNA. As the South Korean government urged its people to remain calm, there was no sign of anxiety among villagers along the border. In Seoul, with a population of 10.4 million and just 35 miles from the border, preparations continued for the funeral on Friday of former President Roh Moo-hyun  who committed suicide last Saturday. North Korea  intensified its threats  against South Korea and the United States on Wednesday with warnings of a “powerful military strike” if any North Korean ships were stopped or searched as part of an American-led operation to intercept vessels suspected of carrying unconventional weapons. South Korea agreed to join the operation after North Korea’s nuclear test on Monday. The North had earlier warned the South not to participate in the operation, known as the Proliferation Security Initiative. In their  Wednesday statement, the North Koreans also said that they “no longer feel bound” by the 1953 armistice. Technically, the two Koreas have remained at war for more than 50 years, because the 1953 armistice was never replaced with a final peace treaty. The North Koreans had previously called the armistice a “useless piece of paper” and declared that they no longer felt bound by it. Washington and Seoul consider such North Korean statements a gambit to raise tension and draw the United States to bilateral talks. In Washington, Secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton said, “North Korea continues to act in a provocative and belligerent manner toward its neighbors.” “There are consequences to such actions,” she said, adding that discussions were under way at the United Nations  “to add to the consequences North Korea will face.” Diplomats said American and Japanese officials were drafting a Security Council resolution that would concentrate on five or six ways to flesh out existing sanctions against North Korea that had never been enforced. Although China supports the idea of sanctions, it wants to work slowly and to bolster measures first passed in 2006 rather than creating new ones, they said. The proposals include banning imports and exports of all arms — only heavy weapons are restricted now. “We want to dry out their resources for the military,” said a senior Western diplomat, speaking anonymously because of the sensitivity of the negotiations. Since inter-Korean relations began deteriorating a year ago, analysts at government-run and private policy institutes in South Korea have often warned of a possible naval skirmish. In interviews in recent weeks, they have said that if South Korea joined the global interdiction program, the chances of a North Korean provocation would increase. The analysts said North Korea might stage a limited armed provocation along the disputed western sea border, where the two navies clashed in skirmishes in June 1999 and June 2002 during the crabbing season. Any clash between the Koreas would probably be on a similarly limited scale, the analysts said. South Korea’s president, Lee Myung-bak, lauded his people on Wednesday for their “mature response” to the North’s behavior. He noted that the North’s nuclear test and its subsequent missile launchings did not affect stock indexes and foreign exchange markets beyond initial jitters. Seoul, the South Korean capital, with a population of 10.4 million, is just 35 miles from the North Korean border and well within the range of North Korean missiles and artillery. But most South Koreans and foreign investors here are accustomed to threats from the North. Meanwhile, analysts said, South Korea’s decision to join the antiproliferation initiative — a global effort that seeks to interrupt air and sea deliveries of nuclear and other unconventional weapons, missile parts and delivery systems — is largely symbolic. Seoul has said that it will stop only suspicious ships in its own territorial waters, a sovereign right it already has. In addition, the chance that the North would send ships carrying such materials into South Korean waters is low.

North Korea threatened to withdraw cheap labor and other incentives for South Korean factories in a joint industrial complex during rare talks on Tuesday.

SEOUL,South Korea—North Koreathreatened to withdraw cheap labor and other incentives for South Korean factories in a joint industrial complex during rare but brief talks between the countries on Tuesday. The two sides wrangled for 11 hours over where to meet and what to discuss at the complex, in the North Korean border town ofKaesong. After they finally sat down to talk, the session ended in 22 minutes. “North Korea said it will reconsider all privileges it has given to the South at Kaesong,” the South Korean government said in anews release. The North demanded talks on “readjusting wages to a realistic level.” The North’s proposal for wage talks signaled that despite North Korea’s previous threats, it intended to keep the Kaesong complex going. The Kaesong factories provide an important source of cash for the government at a time  the United Nations is calling for tightened sanctions on North Korea after its defiant rocket launching this month. But the demand for higher wages threatens the biggest incentive Kaesong offers for South Korean companies and could doom the project. About 90 factories run by South Koreans make kitchen utensils, shoes and electronic parts, employing 39,000 North Korean workers at an average monthly wage of $70 to $75 per worker. During the talks on Tuesday, South Korea failed to win the release of a South Korean worker detained at the complex for nearly a month on charges of making derogatory comments about the North Korean government and enticing a North Korean worker to defect to the South. The North rejected South Korean officials’ request to meet with the worker. The Kaesong industrial park, a showpiece of economic cooperation between the countries, is South Korea’s most visible effort to change the isolated North through capitalist investment. The factories produced $251 million in goods in 2008, a 36 percent increase over 2007.

SEOUL,South Korea— PresidentLee Myung-bakreversed his tough approach onNorth Koreaon Friday and offered to resume dialogue and provide humanitarian aid, but the move was immediately clouded by the fatal shooting of South Korean woman by a North Korean soldier in the North’s tourism enclave. A tourism company reported that the woman was shot shortly before dawn on Friday after wandering into a fenced-off military area near Diamond Mountain, a tourism zone that was opened to South Koreans in 1998. South Korea immediately suspended visits to the zone, which is a symbol of cross-border reconciliation. Nearly two million South Koreans have visited Diamond Mountain, a scenic spot at the southeastern tip of North Korea. Mr. Lee was informed of the shooting an hour and a half before he was to make his first speech to Parliament as president, his aides said. He pressed ahead with his reconciliation overture, though, saying, “Full dialogue between the two Koreas must resume.” He told lawmakers that his government was “willing to engage in serious consultations” on how to implement accords that the two previous South Korean presidents, Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun, reached with the North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, in 2000 and 2007. There was no immediate North Korean reaction to Mr. Lee’s speech or the shooting. It was not clear whether the death of the tourist, identified as Park Wang-ja, would alter Mr. Lee’s offer. Mr. Lee, whose election last December returned conservatives to power after a decade, had shown reservations bordering on disregard for the agreements negotiated by his predecessors. His reversal came amid mounting domestic and international pressure to soften his policies. Buffeted by weeks of protests against his decision to lift a ban on importing American beef, Mr. Lee was being pressed by his liberal rivals to improve relations with the North at a time when the United States was engaging Mr. Kim. On Friday, Mr. Lee stopped short of saying he was bound by his predecessors’ agreements and reiterated that the South’s priority was disarmament. He hinted that the North would get no major economic aid unless progress was made in ending its nuclear weapons programs. Still, his overture appeared to indicate flexibility. Since his election, he had limited his comments on the issue to the possibility of a “review” of the inter-Korean accords, which promised shipyards, roads, rail assistance and other multibillion-dollar projects for the North. He had also ruled out expanding joint economic projects already under way, such as Kaesong, an industrial complex north of Seoul and a symbol of reconciliation. His position had infuriated North Korea, which considered it an insult to Mr. Kim. Calling Mr. Lee a “sycophant” and a “traitor” in April, the North cut off all official dialogue with the South, ordered South Korean officials to leave Kaesong and demanded a declaration from Mr. Lee that he would honor the agreements. With his campaign promise of a tougher policy on North Korea, Mr. Lee won the support of South Koreans who had complained that the North had been coddled with aid that won few concessions. But last month, North Korea submitted a partial accounting of its nuclear programs; the United States moved to take North Korea off its terrorism blacklist and relax some economic sanctions. Japan also agreed to lift some sanctions, while the North reopened an investigation into abductions of Japanese citizens. The United States began shipping 500,000 tons offood aidto North Korea this month. On Friday, the Unicef was headed to the North’s isolated northeastern provinces two years after being ordered out. When South Korea recently offered to ship 50,000 tons of corn, the impoverished North said it did not need the South’s help, leading some critics in South Korea to charge that Mr. Lee’s policy had backfired. “He thought North Korea would buckle under a hard-line policy, but it didn’t happen,” said Cho Seong-ryoul, an analyst at the Institute for National Security Strategy in Seoul. “Change in his policy became inevitable.” Mr. Cho said Mr. Lee disappointed many conservative supporters, including aging South Koreans who seek to be reunited with their relatives in the North and businessmen who had hoped to relocate their labor-intensive factories to Kaesong. On Friday, Mr. Lee said he was ready to help relieve the food shortage in the North. In return, he proposed reunions of aging Koreans separated by the 1950-53 Korean conflict. Cheong Seong-chang, an analyst at the Sejong Institute, a research organization in Seoul, had predicted the failure of Mr. Lee’s hard-line policy. He said the president’s overture on Friday would not win any immediate response from the North because it lacked specifics, such as a commitment to expand the Kaesong complex. Mr. Lee’s government badly needs a success. Amid rising oil prices, it was forced to scale back the economic growth target for this year. The crisis heightened when large crowds spilled out in recent weeks to protest American beef imports. “The beef fiasco showed to him that he cannot overcome the crisis by dividing the country further over North Korea,” Mr. Cheong said. In Beijing, six-nation talks on the North’s nuclear programs entered their second day on Friday, with negotiators discussing North Korea’s complaint that it had not received most of the energy aid it had been promised. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Qin Gang, reported progress. “Just what are the specific agreements on verification, I think the six parties will make an announcement soon,” Mr. Qin said at a news conference.

SEOUL — In a surprise initiative, the conservative president-elect ofSouth Korea,Lee Myung-bak, said Monday that he would meet with the North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, anytime if a meeting could help persuade Mr. Kim to abandon his nuclear weapons programs. Mr. Lee, who will be sworn in on Feb. 25, made the proposal during a nationally televised news conference to discuss the work of his transitional team, which has been reviewing policies since his Dec. 19 election. He said that he was willing to meet Mr. Kim as often as possible and that the next meeting should take place in South Korea. The offer was a departure from the approach taken by Mr. Lee’s predecessor, the departing president, Roh Moo-hyun. Mr. Roh was widely accused by conservative critics of coddlingNorth Koreawith considerable aid, but he had shown reservations about meeting Mr. Kim. Not until last October, four months before the end of his term in February, did he travel to Pyongyang to meet Mr. Kim. “If a summit between the leaders of South and North Korea will help persuade the North to give up its nuclear programs and benefit both the South and North, I can do it anytime,” Mr. Lee said. Mr. Lee’s two predecessors, Mr. Roh and Kim Dae-jung, each met Mr. Kim once, both times in Pyongyang. There was no immediate reaction to the proposal from North Korea. Mr. Lee’s proposal — and his expression of hope on Monday to “improve inter-Korean relations substantially” — signaled that there would be no drastic change in policy toward North Korea. Mr. Lee emphasized that “an era of South-North cooperation can be advanced” only when North Korea carries out its agreement to disable its principal nuclear complex and declare all its nuclear assets. Mr. Lee also stressed that he would not let his efforts to engage the North damage Seoul’s relations with Washington. “Until now, South Korean-U.S. relations were somewhat neglected for the sake of inter-Korean relations,” Mr. Lee said, faulting Mr. Roh. “My theory is that if South Korean-U.S. relations get stronger, it will actually help improve inter-Korean relations. And it can actually help improve North Korean-U.S. relations.” Conservatives criticized Mr. Roh for putting Seoul’s relations with Washington through periods of near-public conflict, especially over his reluctance to criticize North Korea’s human rights abuses and his insistence that South Korea pursue joint economic projects even before the North took serious steps toward phasing out its nuclear program. Mr. Lee’s election marked the end of a decade of liberal rule in South Korea. A former chief executive at the Hyundai conglomerate who is interested in investing in the former Communist bloc, Mr. Lee is considered less hard-line toward the North than other conservatives. But he demands that North Korea reciprocate the South’s friendly gestures. In his meeting with Mr. Kim, Mr. Roh agreed to a series of joint economic projects that could help rebuild the North’s economy. On Monday, Mr. Lee said his government would be willing to follow through on the pledges Mr. Roh made — but only after his government determined that they were feasible and supported by “national consensus.” Efforts to denuclearize the North hit their latest snag after it missed a year-end deadline to declare all its nuclear programs and to disable its main nuclear site.

SEOUL, Nov. 14 — Meeting for the first time in 15 years, the prime ministers of North andSouth Koreatoday discussed turning their disputed western sea border, the site of naval skirmishes as recent as five years ago, into a “peace and cooperation zone” for joint fishing and manufacturing. The South Korean initiative was at the top of the agenda as North Korean Prime Minister Kim Yong Il and his South Korean counterpart, Han Duck Soo, began three days of talks in Seoul, hoping to extend the detente fostered by the summit meeting in October and the North’s recent move to disable its nuclear weapons facilities. Kim Yong Il, a transportation expert, was promoted to prime minister in April, with a directive from the North Korean leaderKim Jong Ilto revive the North’s moribund economy. Kim Yong Il’s trip to Seoul followed a rare visit late last month to Vietnam, which has normalized ties with Washington and began rebuilding its economy with outside investment. The South Korea hopes that the North will follow Vietnam’s course soared when Kim Jong Il reportedly told the visiting Vietnamese leader, Communist Party secretary-general Nong Duc Manh, in mid-October that he wanted to emulate its policy of economic reform. Today, Mr. Manh met South Korean President Roh Moo Hyun in Seoul. South Korea fought alongside American troops in Vietnam but is now the largest foreign investor there. Mr. Roh was expected to ask Mr. Manh to help persuade Kim Jong Il to follow Vietnam’s example. “The whole nation is eager to see the Oct. 4 declaration implemented at an early date,” Kim Yong Il said after arriving in Seoul on a direct flight from Pyongyang. He was referring to a broadly worded summit agreement between the Kim Jong Il and Mr. Roh. Most members of Mr. Kim’s 43-strong delegation were economic officials. In their summit meeting in October, Kim Jong Il and Mr. Roh agreed to a number of joint economic projects that could benefit both Koreas. South Korea hopes to improve road and railways in the North and build a string of special economic zones so that it can relocate some of its labor-intensive industries there. The prime ministers are meeting now to follow up on the deal. “We have to reach very specific agreements at these talks and put them into action,” Mr. Han said. Among other things, Mr. Han proposed a joint inter-Korean committee to build the “peace and cooperation zone.” That plan calls for creating a joint fishing ground along the disputed sea border and opening Haeju, a major naval base on the North’s southwestern tip, for commercial ships from the South, as well as building an industrial park there. Warships from Haeju engaged in skirmishes with South Korean gunboats in 1999 and 2002. Persuading the two navies to pull back and turn the area into an economic zone will drastically ease tension on the divided peninsula, which remains technically at war after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not with a peace treaty. The North’s hardline military has grown uneasy over the increasing detente. It was unclear whether the People’s Army ofNorth Koreawill try to block the latest initiative, as it has stymied previous attempts for reconciliation, including a South Korean proposal to run trains across the border. The defense ministers of the two Koreas are scheduled to meet in Pyongyang late this month. Also on today’s agenda were proposals for building joint shipyards in the North and improving communications, transport and other servcies for South Koreans working at a joint industrial zone in Gaesong, a North Korean border town near Haeju. Some 20,000 North Korean workers are already working there producing clothes, kitchen utensils and watches in South Korean-run factories. The South wants to expand the industrial park to house hundreds of factories and wants the North to remove red tape, including a ban on the Internet.

SEOUL,South Korea, Nov. 7 — The military threat presented byNorth Koreahas not diminished despite its early steps to dismantle its nuclear weapons program, the South Korean defense minister said Wednesday. During a news conference withRobert M. Gates, the visiting American defense secretary, South Korea’s minister of national defense, Kim Jang-soo, said there was no clear intelligence that the Communist North had halted its pursuit of “asymmetrical weapons.” “Although it’s true that North Korea has begun the process of disabling its nuclear program, we cannot say that the threat from North Korea has reduced tangibly or discernibly,” Mr. Kim said. “In order for us to change our view of the situation, we would need very real and very tangible military intelligence to that effect,” he said. “What is certain is that North Korea is continuing to pursue the acquisition of asymmetrical weapons. We cannot conclude that the threat from North Korea has been reduced.” Asymmetrical weapons is another term for unconventional weapons. Mr. Gates, midway through a week of meetings in China, South Korea and Japan, said the United States “would welcome, and do welcome, the beginning of disablement of nuclear facilities in the North.” A senior State Department expert on Korea said Monday that he had confirmation that work had begun to disable North Korea’s nuclear facilities at the main Yongbyon complex, 60 miles north of Pyongyang. But Mr. Gates cautioned that much work remained to make certain that North Korea had surrendered its nuclear weapons and its weapons development programs. He said North Korea must offer to disclose all of its nuclear weapons facilities and nuclear weapons activities. “So there are several steps in this process,” he  said. “Of course, the object is the denuclearization of North Korea. So we are started on a path, but we are far from reaching our destination.” Sung Kim, the State Department official who visited the Yongbyon complex, said that North Korean officials were “very cooperative” and that the effort was “off to a good start.” North Korea turned off the reactor at Yongbyon in July and pledged to disable it — but not dismantle it — by Dec. 31.  In exchange, North Korea will receive concessions, including energy assistance, in a deal negotiated with the United States, China, Japan, South Korea and Russia. The agreement, first reached in February, also grants North Korea political concessions. But Mr. Gates said Wednesday that North Korea’s desire to be removed from the American roster of terrorist states would be fulfilled only when North Korea had met a list of official criteria — implying that such a determination had not yet been made. Mr. Gates, at the end on Wednesday of annual security talks with South Korea, said the North Korean conventional and nuclear threat remained “the focal point” of a  “strong and vibrant” alliance between the United States and South Korea. North Korea has about one million people in its armed forces and conducted its first nuclear detonation in October 2006. The American military force stationed in South Korea has been  diminishing. Three years ago, 37,500 American military personnel were in South Korea. One American brigade formerly based in South Korea deployed to Iraq in 2004. The current American presence here is 28,000, which will drop to 25,000 by 2012. South Korea fields 680,000 in its armed forces, which are among the most modern in Asia. In 2012, the South Korean military is to take over wartime operational control of its own forces, a command responsibility previously exercised by the American four-star general here. Underscoring the importance of the alliance with South Korea, Mr. Gates was joined  here by Adm. Mike Mullen, the  chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Adm. Timothy J. Keating, commander of American forces in the Pacific; and Gen. B. B. Bell, the American commander in South Korea.

PYONGYANG, North Korea — Despite growing international pressure to cancel a live-fire artillery drill off the coast ofNorth Korea, the South Korean military on Sunday showed no signs of backing away from its planned exercise, which the North said could lead to “catastrophe” on the Korean Peninsula. The joint chiefs of staff in Seoul said bad weather prevented the planned drill from being held over the weekend. Officials indicated that it was being scheduled for Monday or Tuesday. Russia and China have called on Seoul to cancel the drill, and Moscow requested an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Sunday morning. A draft resolution by the council calls on “all parties concerned to exercise maximum restraint and to avoid any steps which could cause a further escalation of tension in the Korean Peninsula and the entire region.” The council also is expected to ask Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to send a special envoy to the region. Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a former United States ambassador to the United Nations, met over the weekend with North Korean officials in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, including Maj. Gen. Pak Rim-su. General Pak is a member of North Korea’s powerful National Defense Commission and oversees the demilitarized zone and the armistice between the two Koreas. The Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice, not a full peace treaty. Mr. Richardson made two proposals: a military-to-military hot line and a military commission that would include the United States,South Koreaand North Korea, to monitor crises like these in the Yellow Sea. A previous channel of communication, in the so-called truce village of Panmunjom, was severed this year as tensions grew over the sinking of a South Korean warship. The governments are now limited to leaving messages for each other at an unofficial office at a jointly operated industrial park inside North Korea. Mr. Richardson said that General Pak was open to the suggestion of the military hot line and the commission, but that he did not accept them. “Obviously this is a little bit of progress,” Mr. Richardson said. His trip was approved by the State Department, although he stressed that he was not an official administration envoy. Before meeting with General Pak, Mr. Richardson said that, “The fact that the U.N. Security Council is taking up the Korea issue is important because it will not only help to ease tension, but will also be able to provide cover for all sides not to take aggressive action.” He added, “The fact that Russia has proposed the emergency action, and the fact that China has said that the situation is precarious means that North Korea’s main allies on the Security Council are urging restraint.” North Korea said through its official news agency, K.C.N.A., that it would retaliate if the South Korean drill went ahead and that it would strike the South with “unpredictable self-defensive blows.” The principal North Korean newspaper, Rodong Sinum, warned that the artillery drill would lead to “brutal consequences beyond imagination,” in a commentary quoted by the South Korean news agency Yonhap. Mr. Richardson said North Korean leaders were “very concerned about the artillery efforts.” When asked what would North Korea do if the exercises went forward, Mr. Richardson said General Pak “didn’t answer directly, but I was very concerned with some of the statements that came forth.” But he added that General Pak “was not threatening.” “He was not belligerent,” Mr. Richardson said. “He was positive. He realized the gravity of the situation.” Seoul has said the exercise will be held on Yeonpyeong Island, near a disputed maritime border in the Yellow Sea. The island, which lies just eight miles off the North Korean coast, was the target of a North Korean artillery barrage on Nov. 23 that killed two South Korean marines and two civilians. The North said the shelling was a retaliation for South Korea having fired into its waters. The South said the attack by the North was unprovoked. North Korea does not recognize the sea border, known as the Northern Limit Line. The waters off Yeonpyeong are North Korea’s “inviolable territorial waters,” the North said in a statement quoted by K.C.N.A. “They claim it’s their territory,” Mr. Richardson said. About two dozen United States military personnel are expected to take part in the artillery drill, in support roles and as observers. The North said the Americans were being used as a “human shield.” General Pak also told Mr. Richardson that the remains of hundreds of American soldiers killed during the Korean War were recently discovered in the North, and that he hoped a joint recovery effort could resume. Analysts said Sunday that it was unclear if meteorology or diplomacy had delayed the drill. Sung-Yoon Lee, a professor of political science at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts, said the South Korean government had failed to mount a strong response to the first North Korean shelling and thus had “put itself in a bind.” “Hence, the obfuscation about the drills,” Professor Lee said. “Were such military exercises so dependent on the vagaries of the wind and currents, how on earth would a sovereign state defend itself?”

Analysts were reluctant to connect the military talks to the emergence of a likely successor to Kim Jong-il.

SEOUL, South Korea — Just a day after a new leadership structure had taken shape  inNorth Korea, with the youngest son of the nation’s leader being awarded major military and political posts, the South Korean Defense Ministry said that the two Koreas held military talks on Thursday at the border village of Panmunjom. The two sides had not held such talks in two years. A South Korean defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, declined to discuss the agenda of the working-level meeting. But it was widely expected thatSouth Koreawould raise the issue of the sinking of one of its warships in March. The renewal of military talks with the South was proposed this month by the North Koreans, apparently to focus on preventing naval clashes along their disputed western sea border. Political analysts in Seoul were reluctant to connect the sudden resumption of military negotiations to what appeared to be theemergence of the son, Kim Jong-un, as the eventual successorto his father, Kim Jong-il, as the supreme North Korean leader. The younger Mr. Kim, who is believed to be 27 or 28, was given the rank of four-star general in the People’s Army and was named a deputy chairman of the military commission of the Workers’ Party. A senior military post for Kim Jong-un was a prerequisite for his ascendancy to power. His father’s “military first” doctrine  has given the armed forces the leading role in the political life of the country, even ahead of the Workers’ Party. Any future leader of North Korea would need a substantial military paragraph on his or her résumé. Kim Jong-un’s other significant new positions — he now has a seat on the party’s Central Committee and is one of two deputy chairmen of the party’s military commission — are seen as more purely political and policy-making posts. The military commission’s other new deputy chairman is Vice Marshal Ri Yong-ho. A seasoned military officer,  Marshal Ri, 68, has been chief of the army’s general staff. He was also given a seat on the party’s Politburo, making him a superior of the younger Mr. Kim, whom he is expected to tutor and guide. “Ri should be seen as the right-hand man for the inexperienced Kim Jong-un in the military,” Cheong Seong-chang, a North Korea expert at Sejong Institute near Seoul, told the Yonhap News Agency.  He will “play a crucial role in the transfer of power from Kim Jong-il to Kim Jong-un,” Mr. Cheong said. But other analysts said the changes were not likely to be well received by North Koreans who see the dynastic succession as a contradiction of the state’s Communist ideology. “This kind of succession is very rare, and the ordinary North Korean people won’t like it,” said Yun Duk-kim, a North Korea expert and a professor at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security in Seoul. But, he added: “It’s difficult for people to show their displeasure, of course. It’s a totalitarian system. They just obey.” The North was also thought to have objected to propaganda leaflets that were dropped over the border by South Korean activists. The leaflets talked about Kim Jong-il’s frailty and his lavish lifestyle in the face of widespread hunger. They called on North Koreans to rise up against the regime. South Korea and the United States have blamed a North Korean torpedo attack for the sinking of its ship, theCheonan, which killed 46 sailors. Seoul has demanded an apology from the North, which has denied any involvement. A statement by the United Nations Security Council in July expressed “deep concern” over the Cheonan’s sinking, but did not find North Korea culpable. The North Korean ambassador told reporters that the statement was “a great diplomatic victory.” Lee Sung-yoon, a professor at the Fletcher School at Tufts University, said Wednesday that North Korea “has closed the chapter on the Cheonan” since the United Nations statement. “They’re saying, ‘Let’s move on,’ ” he said. Analysts in Seoul said that North Korea was unlikely to apologize — at least not officially or publicly. But others did not rule it out.

Pyongyang is sending strong signals about its willingness to resume peace negotiations.

Atlanta DURING my recent travels to North Korea and China, I received clear, strong signals that Pyongyang wants to restart negotiations on a comprehensive peace treaty with the United States and South Korea and on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The components of such an agreement have been fairly constant over the past 16 years, first confirmedin 1994by the United States and Kim Il-sung, then the North Korean leader, and repeated bya multilateral agreement negotiated in September 2005. The basic provisions hold that North Korea’s old graphite-moderated nuclear energy reactor, which can easily produce weapons-grade plutonium, and all related facilities and products should be disabled under inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency; that while the reactor is shut down, the United States should provide fuel oil or electric power to North Korea until new power plants are built; that the United States should provide assurances against the threat of nuclear attack or other military actions against North Korea; that the United States and North Korea should move toward the normalization of political and economic relations and a peace treaty covering the peninsula; that better relations should be pursued by North Korea, South Korea and Japan; and that all parties should strengthen their economic cooperation on energy, trade and investment. The comprehensive agreement reached by the Clinton administration was disavowed in 2002 by President George W. Bush. Nevertheless, although North Korea reprocessed fuel rods into plutonium and tested nuclear explosives in 2006, good progress was made in its talks with the United States, South Korea, China, Japan and Russia. But conditions have since deteriorated: the talks stopped in 2009, and that same year the United Nations imposed sanctions on Pyongyang after it conducted a second nuclear test and launched a long-range missile. North Korea also prohibited reunions between North and South Korean families. Tensions grew still higher this year when North Korea detained an American, Aijalon Gomes,whom it accused of crossing into its territory, in January and aSouth Korean fishing crewin August. However, there are now clear signals of eagerness from Pyongyang to resume negotiations and accept the basic provisions of the denuclearization and peace efforts. In July, North Korean officials invited me to come to Pyongyang to meet with Kim Jong-il, the North Korean leader, and other officials to secure the release of Mr. Gomes. Those who invited me said that no one else’s request for the prisoner’s release would be honored. They wanted me to come in the hope that I might help resurrect the agreements on denuclearization and peace that were the last official acts of Kim Il-sung before his death in 1994. I notified the White House of this invitation, and approval for my visit was given in mid-August, after North Korea announced that Mr. Gomes would soon be transferred from his hospital back to prison and that Kim Jong-il was no longer available to meet with me. (I later learned that he would be in China.) In Pyongyang I requested Mr. Gomes’s freedom, then had to wait 36 hours for his retrial, pardon and release. During this time I met with Kim Yong-nam, president of the presidium of the North’s Parliament, and Kim Kye-gwan, the vice foreign minister and chief negotiator for North Korea in the six-party nuclear talks. Both of them had participated in my previous negotiations with Kim Il-sung. They understood that I had no official status and could not speak for the American government, so I listened to their proposals, asked questions and, when I returned to the United States, delivered their message to Washington. They told me they wanted to expand on the good relationships that had developed earlier in the decade with South Korea’s president at the time, Kim Dae-jung, and Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan. They expressed concern about several recent American actions, including unwarranted sanctions, ostentatious inclusion of North Korea among nations subject to nuclear attack and provocative military maneuvers with South Korea. Still, they said, they were ready to demonstrate their desire for peace and denuclearization. They referred to the six-party talks as being “sentenced to death but not yet executed.” The following week I traveled to Beijing, where Chinese leaders informed me that Mr. Kim had delivered the same points to them while I was in Pyongyang, and that he later released the South Korean fishing crew and suggested the resumption of family reunions. Seeing this as a clear sign of North Korean interest, the Chinese are actively promoting the resumption of the six-party talks. A settlement on the Korean Peninsula is crucial to peace and stability in Asia, and it is long overdue. These positive messages from North Korea should be pursued aggressively and without delay, with each step in the process carefully and thoroughly confirmed.

Tentative steps on Monday showed that North and South Korea were weighing the option of stepping back from their confrontation.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreaexpressed a desire to keep a joint industrial complex in operation, South Korean officials said Monday, while the South indicated that it might reconsider its decision to revive psychological warfare against the North. The developments showed that the two Koreas were carefully weighing the option of easing their confrontation, analysts said. Tensions on the divided Korean Peninsula have deteriorated to their worst point in years after a South Korean warshipsank on March 26.South Koreablamed a North Korean torpedo attack for the blast. “Neither side can afford to keep building up tensions,” said Kim Yong-hyun, a North Korea specialist at Dongguk University in Seoul. “Both sides have been raising tensions the way you blow into your balloon, and now they need an excuse for each other to stop blowing so that the balloon won’t burst.” After itformally accused the Northon May 20 of having responsibility for the sinking, South Korea cut off nearly all trade with the North and began a diplomatic campaign to bring it before  the United Nations Security Council for punishment. The South also vowed to resume psychological warfare against the North, after a six-year hiatus, by rebuilding loudspeakers along the border for propaganda broadcasts and by dropping leaflets over the North using balloons. If the psychological war resumes, the North has warned that it would shut down a joint industrial complex at the North Korean border town of Kaesong — the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean ties. The North also warned that it would shoot artillery shells across the border to blast the loudspeakers. The South would certainly have to respond in kind, officials said, raising the possibility of a major skirmish along a border guarded by nearly two million troops on both sides. “We want to continue to develop the Kaesong project,” the North Korean authorities said in a message delivered through South Korean businessmen at Kaesong on Sunday, according to a senior South Korean government official who briefed reporters Monday on the condition of anonymity. Meanwhile, Jang Gwang-il, a senior policy maker at the Defense Ministry in Seoul, said that the South Korean military was still reviewing when to send leaflet balloons over the North. His remark was seen as a step back from the military’s earlier vow to send the balloons as soon as the weather permitted. Mr. Jang said that the South would “make a comprehensive review of the situation” before deciding whether and when to start launching leaflet balloons or broadcasting propaganda across the border. The apparent pause in inter-Korean tensions came a day after Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China declined to join South Korea and Japan in publicly condemning North Korea ata three-way weekend summit meeting, instead urging both Koreas to defuse tensions. On Monday, Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama of Japan told Mr. Wen that he supported Seoul’s plans to bring North Korea before the Security Council for sanctions or condemnation, The Associated Press reported. The two countries also agreed to start negotiations over a treaty to develop natural gas resources under the East China Sea, said Osamu Sakashita, a spokesman for the prime minister’s office. South Korea remains determined to force North Korea to apologize and punish those responsible for the sinking, which killed 46 South Korean sailors. The North denies any involvement and warns of war if new sanctions are imposed. But analysts say that neither Korea can benefit from sustained tensions. Public denouncements of the North may help candidates of President Lee Myung-bak’s governing party in local elections in South Korea on Wednesday, but prolonged tensions will hurt its economy, they said. While most South Koreans condemn the North for the sinking and support Mr. Lee’s handling of the crisis so far, many also blame his tough stance toward the North for fueling  a military provocation, surveys here show. The North Korean threat to shut down the border raised some concern in South Korea that hundreds of South Korean workers who commute to Kaesong on a typical workday might be trapped there as hostages. But South Korean officials say that if Kaesong is closed, North Korea will suffer more than the South. About 43,000 North Koreans would lose some of the best-paying jobs available for workers in the impoverished country, and the resulting discontent could spread out of Kaesong, they argue. The complex also provides the North with $40 million in workers’ wages, most of which goes to the government. The Kaesong complex, where 121 South Korean factories hire cheap North Korean labor, has been both praised as a testament to inter-Korean cooperation and denounced as a source of cash for the North’snuclear weaponsprogram. Of the several measures the South has taken, the possible resumption of psychological warfare has raised the most hackles in the North, which strives to keep its population isolated from outside news. Last week, the South resumed its “Voice of Freedom” radio broadcasts,  which do not directly criticize North Korean leaders but promote the capitalist lifestyles of the South.

The apparent sinking of a South Korean warship may have more to do with the rise to power of Kim Jong-il’s 27-year-old son than typical north-south saber rattling.

SEOUL, South Korea — Over the years, South Korean officials and analysts have grown accustomed to the North Koreans’ habit of stirring up trouble, whether through missile launchings or nuclear tests. And when faced with international censure, the North lashes out with threats of retaliation and even war. Typically, it is an attention-getting tactic, the South Koreans say, used to win diplomatic and economic concessions. But this time the motivation may be different. Experts onNorth Koreasay that its latest act of belligerence — the sinking of a South Korean ship in March, one of the worst military provocations since the end of the Korean War in 1953 — reflects a new force at play: the efforts of the North’s leader,Kim Jong-il, to establish his 27-year-old son as a legitimate heir to carry on the family dynasty. “His succession to power is the factor that links all other factors when we try to explain why the North is doing what it does these days,” said Choi Jin-wook, a senior analyst at theKorea Institute for National Unification, the Seoul government’s top research organization on North Korea. “Without it, no explanation is complete or convincing.” On the surface, the North’s ever-intensifying policy of confrontation can appear self-defeating. But, officials and analysts here say, it is all part of Mr. Kim’s effort to groomKim Jong-un, the youngest of his three known sons, as his successor. According to this line of thinking, the sinking of the South Korean ship was intended to create an atmosphere of crisis that would serve Mr. Kim’s purposes, both by rallying public support and winning the crucial backing of the military. “Kim Jong-il needs to create a warlike atmosphere at home to push through with the succession of power to his son,” said Cheon Seong-whun, another senior analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification. “To do that, he needs tensions and an external enemy.” Mr. Kim himself was carefully groomed for years to succeed his father, Kim Il-sung, who died in 1994. In the years he was consolidating his power base, Kim Jong-il was credited with masterminding a 1968 commando attack on the South Korean presidential palace in Seoul and the 1976 ax killings of two American military officers at the border, said Baek Seung-joo, a North Korea specialist at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses. Also in 1968, North Korea captured an American naval intelligence ship, the Pueblo, holding 82 hostages for nearly a year, while its commandos attacked remote South Korean villages and clashed with the South Korean military for two months. But this latest succession has been thrust upon the Kims prematurely, after Kim Jong-il’s reported stroke in 2008 and subsequent health problems.  Although Mr. Kim, 68, was healthy enough to visit China this month, questions persist over how long he can remain in power. The next step for Kim Jong-un is to make his official public debut, but that has been complicated by his lack of major achievements, analysts said. The elder Mr. Kim “wants to speed up his military-first policy and nuclear program and wants to consolidate the succession process before his health condition becomes worse,” a high-ranking South Korean government official told a group of foreign correspondents in Seoul on Friday. “His third son is also rushing because as a member of the new generation, he wants to prove himself to be very strong and able to control the military leadership. In order to do so, he wants to show to the North Korean leadership that he has achieved some major military outcomes, particularly targeted againstSouth Korea.” Of course, the succession issue is not the only problem facing Kim Jong-il. His trademark policy of building a “strong and prosperous nation” was called into question when his navy lost a humiliating skirmish against the South last November. His government’s recent attempt to arrest inflation and eliminate black markets through a drastic revaluation of the North Korean currency set off more inflation and a wave of popular discontent that extended beyond the capital, Pyongyang. Meanwhile, South Korea refused to offer economic incentives until the North gave up itsnuclear weaponsprogram. With the succession issue and the rising internal and external pressures, it is not surprising that Mr. Kim would  ratchet up confrontation with the South and its allies, said Mr. Cheon, the analyst. North Korea’s propaganda machine uses international condemnation to strengthen internal solidarity, he said. North Korea is now telling its people that the United States and South Korea fabricated the sinking of the South’s ship as a version of the “Gulf of Tonkin incident,” a battle that Washington vastly overstated to justify expanding the Vietnam War. Huge outdoor rallies are being mobilized in the North, according to North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity, a Web site run by defectors from the North, which cited sources  inside North Korea. Last week, using a radio network that reaches every North Korean home, Gen. O Kuk-ryol, a top officer, delivered Mr. Kim’s order to the military and reserve forces to be ready for combat, said the defectors’ Web site. But Mr. Kim’s most concerted efforts seem to be directed at the military, the critical power base for his son. Despite United Nations sanctions that ban exports of luxury goods to the North, Mr. Kim is believed to have smuggled in fancy foreign cars for loyal generals, and in April 100 senior officers received promotions. Ha Tae-keung, who runs Open Radio for North Korea, a Web site based in Seoul that collects news from informants inside the North, said that Mr. Kim’s tactics seemed to be succeeding.  “I think the son is firmly in place,” he said. “He was in charge in Pyongyang when his father and his top aides were all in China.”

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said that there would be consequences for North Korea.

SHANGHAI — Secretary of StateHillary Rodham ClintonwarnedNorth Koreaon Friday that it would face “consequences” forsinking a South Korean warshipin March, as she set off on an intense round of shuttle diplomacy in Asia to muster an international response. “It is important to send a clear message to North Korea that provocative actions have consequences,” Mrs. Clinton said after meeting in Tokyo with the Japanese foreign minister, Katsuya Okada. “We cannot allow this attack onSouth Koreato go unanswered by the international community.” The comments were the first from Mrs. Clinton on what South Korea has called a deliberate North Korean torpedo attack, which killed 46 sailors. Mrs. Clinton declined to lay out the options for a response, saying that would be “premature.” But other administration officials said they included action by theUnited Nations Security Counciland joint American-South Korean naval exercises that could include antisubmarine warfare patrols. South Korea is also likely to squeeze the North economically by reducing trade ties. Mrs. Clinton, who flew to Shanghai later on Friday, will consult with Chinese officials in Shanghai and Beijing on the matter. China’s support is considered crucial, both because it holds a veto in the Security Council and because it is North Korea’s neighbor and the principal supporter of the North’s leader, Kim Jong-il. So far, China has been reluctant to condemn North Korea for the torpedo attack on the 1,200-ton corvette, theCheonan— a reticence that has outraged many in South Korea. Theescalating tensionsbetween North and South Korea have scrambled what had been planned as three days of economic and security talks between China and the United States in Beijing next week. Now, those discussions will be partly eclipsed by what a senior American official characterized as the greatest military provocation on the Korean Peninsula in decades. Already, there is evidence that the tensions have influenced security calculations in the region. After declining for months to work out a deal to move a Marine Corps air base on the island of Okinawa, Japan now appears to be working toward a resolution, driven in part by a reaffirmation of the role the United States military plays in Japan’s security, officials said. Mr. Okada said his government was trying to convince residents of Okinawa that “in the current security environment, the presence of U.S. forces is indispensable for the security of Japan.” He said he hoped a deal would be reached by the end of May, the government’s self-imposed deadline. China is likely to be a tougher sell. President Hu Jintao hosted Mr. Kim  during histrain trip to Chinathis month, just days after meeting with South Korea’s president, Lee Myung-bak. That showed China’s instinct not to take sides in disputes between the North and South. Still, Mrs. Clinton began laying out the case for China’s support in Tokyo, noting that the South Korean government’s investigation of the sinking had been a “thorough and comprehensive scientific examination,” echoing the words Chinese leaders had used in calling for a scientific investigation. The evidence collected, including part of a torpedo propeller, was “overwhelming and condemning,” she said. “Let me be clear: this will not, and cannot, be business as usual,” Mrs. Clinton said, speaking in a grave tone. “There must be an international, not just a regional, but an international response.” While Mrs. Clinton tours the American pavilion on the vast fairgrounds of the Shanghai Expo this weekend — the main event during her stop here — her aides will be huddling elsewhere, making the case that China must back punitive measures against the North. “We’d like to see them acknowledge the reality of what happened and then join with South Korea, Japan and us in fashioning a response,” said a senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. The administration finds itself in a delicate spot: orchestrating international support for South Korea while also deferring to President Lee on the timing and nature of the response. The United States is wary of aggravating an already tense situation; North Korea, which denies the torpedo attack, threatened to respond to military retaliation with “all-out war.” Mrs. Clinton did not speak to reporters traveling on her plane, breaking a common practice on trips by the secretary of state. An aide said she spoke to President Obama about the crisis while en route. Despite the bellicose language from the North, American officials said they did not believe the country was trying to precipitate a military attack. “The hope is that this was a one-off action,” one official said. “We have not seen evidence that this is the first step on the road to war.” When Mrs. Clinton wraps up her meetings in China next week, she will stop in Seoul, South Korea’s capital, to give public backing to President Lee. By then, aides said, there will be clarity on what steps he plans to take.

Citizens feeding information about life in North Korea to the outside world represents a threat to the gulag state.
==::==

==::==
SEOUL, South Korea —North Korea, one of the world’s most impenetrable nations, is facing a new threat: networks of its own citizens feeding information about life there toSouth Koreaand its Western allies. The networks are the creation of a handful of North Korean defectors and South Korean human rights activists using cellphones to pierce North Korea’s near-total news blackout. To build the networks, recruiters slip into China to woo the few North Koreans allowed to travel there, provide cellphones to smuggle across the border, then post informers’ phoned and texted reports on Web sites. The work is risky. Recruiters spend months identifying and coaxing potential informants, all the while evading agents from the North and the Chinese police bent on stopping their work. The North Koreans face even greater danger; exposure could lead to imprisonment — or death. The result has been a news free-for-all, a jumble of sometimes confirmed but often contradictory reports. Some have been important; the Web sites were the first to report the outrage among North Koreans overa drastic currency revaluationlate last year. Other articles have been more prosaic, covering topics like whether North Koreans keep pets and their complaints about the price of rice. But the fact that such news is leaking out at all is something of a revolution for a brutally efficient gulag state that has forcibly cloistered its people for decades even as other closed societies have reluctantly accepted at least some of the intrusions of a more wired world. “In an information vacuum like North Korea, any additional tidbits — even in the swamp of rumors — is helpful,” said Nicholas Eberstadt, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who has chronicled the country’s economic and population woes for decades. “You didn’t used to be able to get that kind of information,” he said of the reports on the currency crisis. “It was fascinating to see the pushback from the lower levels” of North Korean society. Taken together, the now-steady leak of “heard-in-Korea” news is factoring into ever swirling intelligence debates about whether there is a possibility of government collapse, something every American president since Harry S. Truman has wished for, and none have witnessed. The news the informants are spiriting out is not likely to answer the questions about the North’s nuclear program or leadership succession that the United States cares about most. There is no evidence so far that these new sources have any access, or particular insight, into the North Korean leadership or military elite. The informers themselves remain of limited use to American and South Korean spymasters, in part because the North has no broad cellphone network, making it easier for the authorities to eavesdrop on calls and harder for handlers to direct operatives in real time. As one senior American intelligence official put it, “You’re not going to find the North Korean uranium project from these guys.” So the traditional methods of intelligence collection — using satellite imagery, phone and computer intercepts, and informants and agents of South Korea’s intelligence service — remain the main sources of information. Still, the Web sites appear to have inflicted damage. North Korea’s spy agencies, which almost never admit to weaknesses, recently warned that South Korea’s “plot to overthrow our system, employing all manners and means of spying, is spreading from the periphery of our territory and deeply inland.” They vowed retaliation, especially against “human trash,” an apparent reference to the North Koreans who have betrayed their leaders’ code of silence out of principle or for pay to supplement their usually meager wages. The informers’ networks are part of broader changes in intelligence gathering rooted in the North’s weaknesses. The first breakthrough came in the 1990s, when famine stoked by a breakdown in the socialist rationing system drove defectors out of the country and into the arms of South Korean and American intelligence agencies. The famine also led North Korea to allow traders to cross the border into China to bring home food, leaving them vulnerable to foreign agents, the news media and, most recently, the defectors and activists intent on forcing change in the North. The first of their Web sites opened five years ago; there are now five. At least three of the sites receive some financing from the United States Congress through the National Endowment for Democracy. The Web reports have been especially eye-opening for South Koreans, providing a rare glimpse of the aptly named Hermit Kingdom untainted by their own government’s biases, whether the anti-Communists who present the North in the worst light or liberals who gloss over bad news for fear of jeopardizing chances at détente. “I take pride in my work,” said Mun Seong-hwi, a defector turned Web journalist with the site Daily NK, who works with the informers and uses an alias to protect relatives he left behind. “I help the outside world see North Korea as it is.” Even in the days of the Iron Curtain, North Korea was one of the world’s most closed societies. There were few Western embassies where spies could pose as diplomats. And with citizens deputized to watch one another for suspicious activities, strangers could not escape notice for long. Of the 8,400 agents South Korea sent over the border between the end of the Korean War in 1953 and 1994, just 2,200, or about 1 in 4, made it home. Some defected, according to former agents, but many were killed. As recently as 2008, when the North’s leader, Kim Jong-il, reportedly had a stroke, it was long-distance sleuthing rather than on-the-ground spying that broke the news. South Korean agents intercepted a government e-mail message containing his brain scans, according to the Monthly Chosun magazine. The Web sites have not uncovered news that delicate, although the implications of their reports on the currency crisis, later confirmed by South Korean government officials, were far-reaching. They said that the North was requiring people to exchange old banknotes for new ones at a rate of 100 to 1, as well as limiting the amount of old money that could be swapped. That suggested that officials in the North were cracking down on the few glimmers of private enterprise that they had tolerated, dashing hopes that the country might follow China’s lead of at least opening its economy anytime soon. Still, the Web sites are plagued with challenges. The cellphones work on China’s cellular networks, so they operate only within several miles of the Chinese border. Because North Koreans cannot travel freely in their country, the Web sites are forced to depend mostly on people who live near China. Beyond that, Ha Tae-keung, who runs one of the Web sites, says that some sources are prone to exaggerate, possibly in the hopes of earning the bonuses he offers for scoops. He and other Web site operators, meanwhile, are vulnerable to “information brokers” in the North who sell fake news. But Mr. Ha said that the quality of the information was improving as Web sites hired more defectors who left government jobs and remained in touch with former colleagues, often by cellphone. “These officials provide news because they feel uncertain about the future of their regime and want to have a link with the outside world,” he said, “or because of their friendship with the defectors working for us, or because of money.” While such contacts would have been unimaginable 20 years ago, one thing has not changed: the danger. Mr. Mun of Daily NK  says his informers engage in a constant game of cat and mouse with the authorities. The North Korean government can monitor cellphone calls, but tracing them is harder, so the police rove the countryside in jeeps equipped with tracking devices. The informants call him once a week; they never give their names, and they hide the phones far from their homes. Despite those precautions, they are sometimes caught. This month, Mr. Ha’s Web site reported that an arms factory worker was found with a cellphone and confessed to feeding information to South Korea. A source said the informant was publicly executed by firing squad.

President Lee Myung-bak renewed a proposal on Monday that South and North Korea open liaison offices in each other’s capitals to facilitate dialogue.

==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — President Lee Myung-bak renewed a proposal Monday that South andNorth Koreaopen liaison offices in each other’s capitals to facilitate dialogue. Such offices would be the first standing channel of official contact between the governments, which remain divided by a heavily armed border after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce rather than a permanent peace treaty. The two countries maintain a military hotline. North Korea did not immediately respond to Mr. Lee’s offer. When Mr. Lee first made the proposal in April 2008, not long after his inauguration, North Korea dismissed it as a “shallow trick” to disguise his hard-line approach on the North. The North also rejected an American offer to establish offices in Pyongyang and Washington in the 1990s, when the United States began its efforts to end the North’snuclear weaponsdevelopment. The possibility of new connections seems higher, however, after North Korea in itsNew Year’s messageskipped its usual diatribe against the South Korean leader and said its commitment to improving ties withSouth Korearemained “unshakable.” Mr. Lee had angered the North shortly after taking office in 2008 by halting large food shipments pending progress in dismantling the North’s nuclear weapons program. But he seemed to have softened his language a bit. “We need to build a channel for constant dialogue between the South and the North,” Mr. Lee said in his own nationally televised New Year’s address on Monday. “In the new year, we must create a turning point in the South-North relations.” Mr. Lee later told reporters that by “a channel of constant dialogue,” he meant high-level liaison offices. The cautiously upbeat mood in Seoul was bolstered when the newspaperChoson Sinbo, based in Tokyo and considered a conduit for North Korea, said Friday that the North’s New Year’s message might herald a “dramatic event” in inter-Korean relations. The report led the South Korean media to speculate that the two Koreas might be arranging a meeting this year between Mr. Lee and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il. Mr. Lee’s office has denied reports that the two sides held a series of secret meetings to discuss a possible encounter. Both the North Korean New Year’s message and Mr. Lee’s address reaffirmed the fundamental differences over the North’s nuclear weapons program. Mr. Lee urged North Korea to return to six-nation nuclear disarmament talks “so the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula makes progress and a floodgate of South-North Korean cooperation can open in earnest.” North Korea indicated that it would consider giving up its nuclear weapons only after it improved ties with Washington and no longer felt threatened by the United States. In his Monday speech, Mr. Lee also proposed excavating the remains of tens of thousands of South Korean soldiers killed during the war and buried in major battle sites in the North. Bringing them home would be a symbolic gesture of reconciliation in 2010, which marks the 60th anniversary of the outbreak of the war. Repatriation of the dead would be less delicate politically than the longstanding South Korean desire to bring home hundreds of South Korean prisoners of war believed to be still alive in the North, as well as hundreds of South Korean fishermen that were said to be kidnapped by the North after the war. Between 1995 and 2005, North Korea cooperated with the United States to find the remains of American war dead at well-known Korean War battle sites, including Unsan and the Chosin Reservoir, in a deal that brought the impoverished country millions of dollars.

The North Koreans said that such a violation could raise tensions even as its government reaches out for talks with the United States and South Korea.

SEOUL,South Korea— The North Korean military on Thursday accused South Korean warships of trespassing near the North’s west coast, a reminder to its neighbors that it can raise tensions even as its government reaches out for talks with the United States and South Korea. The Defense Ministry in Seoul called the North Korean claim “preposterous.” But the North Korean military made clear its stance. “The reckless military provocations by warships of the South Korean Navy have created such a serious situation that a naval clash may break out between the two sides in these waters,” the North’s state-run news agency said. Its warning came three days afterthe North test-fired five short-range missilesoff its east coast. It also followed a rare conciliatory gesture to the South. On Wednesday,North Koreaexpressed regretover the deaths of six South Koreans killed when water released from a North Korean dam swept across the border last month. The two Koreas have not agreed on a maritime border off their west coast since hostilities in the Korean War ended in 1953. They fought bloody naval skirmishes there in 1999 and 2002. The North’s threats of a naval clash there have been so routine they generate little attention in the South. But analysts also warned that North Korea might test-fire missiles into the disputed waters. Earlier this week, South Korean news media, quoting anonymous government sources, reported that the North was preparing to launch short-range missiles off its west coast. “It’s a typical North Korean tactic to use both dialogue and pressure, sometimes simultaneously, sometimes consecutively, to achieve its goal,” said Chon Hyun-joon, an analyst at the government-financedKorea Institute for National Unificationin Seoul. “Kim Jong-il’s problem is that South Korea and the United States have gotten used to the game he plays.” Mr. Kim, the North Korean leader, is known for the tactic of sending mixed signals: letting his negotiators reach out to South Korea and the United States while ordering his military to strengthen its leverage by reminding the negotiating partners of what might happen if the talks failed, Mr. Chon said. The North and the South were to hold talks on Friday to arrange a new round of reunions of families separated by the Korean War, and North Korea is expected to seekfood aidthrough the talks. On Thursday, South Korea’s unification minister, Hyun In-taek, indicated that his government might ship “limited humanitarian assistance” to the North. Seoul halted aid to the North when President Lee Myung-bak took office early last year. In the first half of this year, North Korea appeared bent on raising tensions, quitting six-nation nuclear disarmament talks, testing a long-range rocket and detonating a nuclear device. It also kicked out American relief agencies. The United States and its allies responded by seeking new United Nations sanctions. Since August, when itfreed two American journalists, North Korea has focused on a smoothing of relations, resuming dialogue with the South and suggesting that it would return to the six-nation talks on ending itsnuclear weaponsprograms if it saw progress in a direct dialogue with Washington. It also allowed hundreds of aging Koreans separated by the warto be temporarily reunitedwith their relatives two weeks ago. Recently, the North has begun renewing contacts with American relief agencies. This week, its foreign minister met with the visiting son of the American evangelist Billy Graham, who runs a relief agency.

Demands for wage increases at a joint industrial park were reduced from 300 percent to 5 percent, in what appeared to be the latest in a series of conciliatory gestures toward South Korea.
==::==

==::==
SEOUL,South Korea—North Korea, in its latest conciliatory gesture toward South Korea, dropped its demand for a huge wage increase for its workers at the joint industrial park that it operates with the South, officials said Friday. North Korea shocked South Korea in recent months when it demanded an effective  quadrupling of the monthly wage for its 40,000 workers at the Kaesong industrial complex. The current average is $75; the North wanted an increase to $300. South Korean managers said the demand threatened the profitability of 114 South Korean factories operating atKaesong, a North Korean border town. Then on Thursday, without explanation, North Korea scaled back its demand to 5 percent, Lee Jong-joo, a spokeswoman of theUnification Ministryin Seoul, said in a news briefing. North Korea also did not repeat its earlier demand that South Korea increase its payments on a 50-year lease of the land at the Kaesong complex. The North wanted a new lease of $500 million, up from the current $16 million. The Kaesong industrial park, where South Korean factories hire North Korean workers to produce goods like kitchen utensils, has served as the most prominent symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation. It also has provided the North with a much-needed source of hard currency. North Korea began softening its stance on Kaesong last month by lifting restrictions on travel by trucks and workers between the complex and South Korea. It also released a South Korean worker at Kaesong who had been held for four and a half months on charges of denouncing the North Korean government. The North, however, angered South Korea last weekend when it released water from a dam upriver, causing a flash flood that killed six South Koreans. On Thursday, one of the top officials in North Korea said that the country’s leader, Kim Jong-il, had no health problems and called speculation about a potential successor “groundless.” The official, Kim Yong-nam, told the Kyodo news agency of Japan that “we haven’t even had a discussion on such an issue in our country.” Mr. Kim is believed to have suffered a stroke in 2008 and had looked sickly in his infrequent public appearances until recently. But he seemed spry when receiving former PresidentBill Clintonon his trip to secure the release of two American journalists last month.

A few points near the demilitarized zone, a ribbon of tank traps and minefields, have been opened to tourists.

TAEKWANG VILLAGE,South Korea— The soldiers stationed at the bunkers and outposts along this stretch of thedemilitarized zonethat divides the two Koreas are on hair-trigger alert as they look across at a   nuclear-armed North. But on a recent morning, they were visited by 120 civilians, mostly young women, who arrived in bright red and white buses. As a South Korean private pointed to a North Korean guard tower visible just two miles away the women giggled at the military precision of his movements. Their first question was whether he was single. But many grew hushed as they began a guided  45-minutehikealong the tall  barbed-wire fences of the world’s most heavily fortified border. “It is eye-opening,” said Huh In-young, 40, who wore a wide-brimmed olive drab hat with her sundress. “We tend to forget about the DMZ in our daily lives.” The group was on a so-called discipline tour, a common practice by paternalistic South Korean companies to build employee spirit and unity, usually with mountain hikes or trips to amusement parks. But a week afterNorth Koreaconductedits second nuclear test, the company — the government-run operator of duty-free shops at Inchon International Airport, near Seoul — opted for something more sobering for its employees, who are more used to thinking about TAG Heuer watches thanTaepodongmissiles. “This is about mental discipline, so they can see this and appreciate all we have now in South Korea,” said Kang Joong-seok, an executive director at the operator, theKorea Tourism Organization. “We take our wealth for granted.” Indeed, while the North continues to threaten war and apparently prepare for still more missile tests, South Korea’s increasingly wealthy population seems largely uninterested in the belligerent attitude of its northern neighbor. In South Korea’s traffic-choked, neon-drenched capital,  Seoul, life has not missed a beat since the North’s nuclear test last week, with residents still chilling at Starbucks or filling their cubicles in the city’s modern office towers. In the local news media, the North’s nuclear test and the world’s response has often taken second billing to the national mourning and protests followingthe suicidealmost two weeks ago of a former president, Roh Moo-hyun. South Koreans seem to have grown accustomed to the North’s sword-rattling, which some dismiss  as   a desperate gambit to wring concessions from Washington. But near the DMZ, a 150-mile ribbon of tank traps and minefields, the tension remains palpable. In the South, a few points have been opened to tourists, including this stretch near Taekwang, a quiet farming village about 45 miles north of Seoul — and 100 miles southeast of the North’s capital, Pyongyang. Visitors can look down on the DMZ from a camouflaged, concrete observation platform that looks like one of the many large bunkers that dot the South Korean side of the border. On the other side of a largely treeless belt of no-man’s land lies a similar line of fences and pillboxes, controlled by North Korea. Until recently, the observatory drew about 3,000 visitors a month, soldiers said. One of the highlights here is T-Bone Hill, a stretch of rolling land that was the site of fierce combat between American and Chinese forces during the Korean War, more than a half century ago. But cancellations have risen along with the tensions since last week’s nuclear test, though the military here says the border remains safe enough for visitors. Jang Seung-jae, president of a company that brings groups to this spot, said he had had more than 100 people cancel in the last week. “The TV keeps talking about how dangerous the DMZ is,” he said. The only group to visit since the test was the staff of the Inchon duty-free shop. Mr. Kang, the executive director, said that some employees expressed concerns, but in the end no one backed out. “It’s likeswine flu,” he said. “Some are afraid of this, and some aren’t. It depends on what you have the stomach for.” For some, the tensions were part of the appeal. “The thrill is why I came,” said Chong Ha-kyun, 51, who said he served as a soldier on the DMZ 18 years ago during his compulsory military service. “Though I have to say, it’s less tense than I remember it.” “South Korea has changed so much, but the North remains frozen in time,” he said, expressing the widely shared feeling here that South Korea now enjoys a comfortable superiority in wealth and technology, if not nuclear capacity. “I think all families should bring their children here, to see that our current prosperity is protected by a line of barbed wire.” At the start of the walk, the group wrote wishes for Korean reunification on brightly colored ribbons, which they then tied onto the fence. None of the hikers said they felt hostility toward the North, though they were fed up with the North’s constant bluster and its weapons tests. “I don’t have negative views about them, even if they are provoking us,” said Kim Hyun-jin, 30. “But I admit I’m nervous to come here. I was half hoping the tour might be canceled.” Later that day, after the group had withdrawn from the DMZ for a leisurely lunch of pork and Korean soju alcohol at a comfortable restaurant, participants said they were glad they had come. “This discipline tour will stick in my memory for a long time,” said Koo Sun-hee, 36, who said it was her first  visit to the border. “North Korea is the closest country to us, but it feels like the farthest country.”

The move, which would effectively shut down a resort viewed as a symbol of reconciliation between the Koreas, followed the shooting of a South Korean tourist.

SEOUL,South Korea— South Korea said it would step up the withdrawal of its personnel from the Kumgang Mountain resort inNorth Koreaon Sunday, after the Communist government ordered the workers to leave. North Korea said Saturday that it would kick out “unnecessary” South Koreans from Kumgang beginning on Sunday, a move that would effectively shut down the resort, a symbol of reconciliation between the  Koreas. The resort has not been operating since July 11, when  a North Korean soldier  shot and killed a South Korean tourist, Park Wang-ja, 53. The South then barred its tourists from the mountain resort, which is just north of the border. The shooting has increased tensions between the North and the South, which have been high since PresidentLee Myung-bakof South Korea, a conservative, took office in February and pledged a tougher policy toward the North. North Korea said that the tourist had wandered into a restricted military area and  ignored warnings to stop. South Korea rejected that explanation and has demanded an investigation. Even before the announcement by North Korea on Saturday, some of the 260 South Koreans working at Kumgang had returned home voluntarily. Most of them are tourism officials and workers affiliated with Hyundai-Asan, a Seoul-based company that runs the resort  with the North Korean government. On Sunday, four employees crossed the border to the South, leaving 146 South Koreans at Kumgang, officials said. About 20 more were expected to return home this week. After meeting in Seoul last week, Mr. Lee and President Bush expressed regret at the shooting and urged the North to engage in dialogue. On Saturday, North Korea accused Mr. Lee of “clinging to the coattail of his American master.”

The expulsions were in reaction to a recent hardening in the South’s policy toward the North over its lack of cooperation on its nuclear program.
==::==

==::==
SEOUL,South Korea— South Korea said Thursday that it was “deeply regrettable” thatNorth Koreahad ordered South Korean officials to leave its territory, but that the South was undaunted. The predawn expulsion on Thursday followed an announcement on Wednesday by the new South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, that his government would not expand economic cooperation with North Korea unless it cooperated in dismantling its nuclear weapons programs. All 11 South Korean government officials who were based in a jointly run factory complex in Kaesong, 37 miles from Seoul on the north side of the two Koreas’ border, returned to South Korea early Thursday after receiving three days to leave. South Korea said Thursday that North Korea was worsening its own isolation by disrupting the countries’ budding economic cooperation. That cooperation can be seen in the Kaesong industrial complex, where 69 South Korean companies employ 23,000 North Koreans to make clothing, watches and other goods. “We will deal with this issue in a pragmatic way,” said Mr. Lee’s spokesman, Lee Dong-kwan. He said that the response would mix “flexibility” and “stern principle,” but did not elaborate. The expulsion did not immediately affect the presence of hundreds of South Korean civilians in Kaesong or the operations of their plants. Nor did it stop the daily cross-border traffic of South Korean factory managers commuting from Seoul or of tourists visiting the North Korean town. President Lee’s two liberal predecessors, Roh Moo-hyun and Kim Dae-jung, had pursued a “sunshine policy,” providing billions of dollars of aid to North Korea and creating joint economic projects. Mr. Lee, a conservative, has accused them of  failing to win concessions on human rights and nuclear disarmament. His new government has been more willing to join the United States in applying direct pressure on North Korea over its nuclear activities.  “Time and patience is running out,” said South Korea’s foreign minister, Yu Myung-hwan, at a news conference Wednesday in Washington. In a related move, President Bush, in a telephone call to President Hu Jintao of China on Wednesday, discussed efforts to get the North to keep its promise to give a full accounting of its nuclear weapons programs before talks on dismantling them begin.

The prime ministers of North and South Korea announced a significant package of cross-border economic projects.

SEOUL,South Korea, Nov. 16 — The prime ministers of North and South Korea announced a significant package of  cross-border economic projects today  to help rebuild the North’s broken economy and  ease military tension on the divided Korean Peninsula by increasing human and cargo traffic across the demilitarized zone. At the end of three days of talks here,North Korea’s prime minister,  Kim Yong-il,  and his South Korean counterpart, Han Duck-soo, agreed to start cross-border freight-train service for the first time in more than half a century, scheduling the first, and highly symbolic, border crossing a week before South Korea holds presidential elections on Dec. 19. Then, starting in the first half of 2008, fishing boats from the two Koreas will work together in a joint fishing zone in the same frontier waters where their respective navies engaged in a bloody skirmish in 2002, the prime ministers said. Also, the North will relocate its warships from Haeju, a naval base near the border, to make room for South Korean cargo ships and a new industrial complex to be built there by South Korean investors. Construction will begin as early as next year. “These projects will chip away at the DMZ,” said Koh Yu-hwan, an expert on North Korea at Dongguk University in Seoul. “They are steppingstones toward what we hope will become a confederation of the two Koreas before eventual reunification.” The joint economic projects will cost South Korea between $11.1 billion and $15.8 billion, according to Kim Young-yoon, a researcher at the government-run Korea Institute for National Unification. The two government leaders have huddled in Seoul since Wednesday to advance the rapprochement created by the inter-Korean summit meeting in early October and the North’s decision to disable its nuclear weapons facilities. At the October meeting, President Roh Moo-hyun and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, called for negotiations on a peace treaty that would formally end the state of war between their countries. The meeting this week was free from the kind of haggling common in inter-Korean negotiations. Analysts  said the two sides were bonded by a common desire to influence the December presidential election by strengthening South Korean liberals, who favor reconciliation and investment for the impoverished North. For North Korea, the talks this week provided a last opportunity to win major investment commitments from the South before Mr. Roh’s liberal government steps down in February. Mr. Roh is barred by the Constitution from running. But liberal candidates close to him are lagging behind the conservative candidate, Lee Myung-bak, by large margins. Some analysts noted that the meeting was notable for avoiding direct discussion of North Korea’s nuclear weapons, the focus of international sanctions. The South believes that investments will help the government in the North see the long-term benefits of giving up nuclear weapons. “It is really disappointing to the international community that the prime ministers of the two Koreas meet for the first time in 15 years, but their agreements didn’t raise a peep about North Korea’s nuclear weapons programs, a major international security threat,” said Nam Joo-hong, a North Korea expert at Kyonggi University. The two sides said freight trains would begin regular service on Dec. 11 on a  16-mile track linking the South Korean city of Munsan and a joint industrial complex in Kaesong , a town just north of the border. Trucks and buses already run between the towns on a newly built road. But train service, even if a short distance, marks a significant first step in South Korea’s grand design: connecting its railways to China, Russia and Europe, its three fast-growing export markets. As part of that dream, South Korea also agreed today to repair North Korea’s decrepit railroad all the way between Kaesong  and the North Korean border with China, starting next year. It will also start building shipyards in North Korea next year. “I firmly believe that today’s agreement will contribute greatly to bringing peace and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula,” said Unification Minister Lee Jae-joung, South Korea’s main policymaker on the North. The new  projects will lift South Korea’s competitiveness as it vies with low-cost China in the global marketplace, officials said. The South is already the North’s No. 2 trading partner, behind China. Trade between the Koreas surged 23 percent to $1.4 billion in the first 10 months of this year. About a quarter of the trade came from goods produced at Kaesong , where 20,000 North Korean workers produce garments and kitchen utensils at 50 South Korean factories, earning only one-third of what their Chinese counterparts do. Goods from Kaesong  were excluded from a free trade agreement reached in April between South Korea and the United States amid fears in Washington that projects like Kaesong  could  buttress the North Korean government before it abandons nuclear weapons. South Korea’s decision to create another such industrial complex at Haeju, near Kaesong , could further complicate the prospects of United States congressional approval of the trade agreement, Mr. Nam said. South Korea agreed today to expand the Kaesong  complex. The North said it would allow South Koreans to use the Internet and cellphones inside Kaesong ; they are forbidden in the rest of the isolated country.

SEOUL,South Korea, Thursday, Oct. 4 — A day after engaging in direct talks for the first time in seven years, the leaders of South andNorth Koreaagreed Thursday on economic projects intended to spur reform inside the North and to forge closer ties between the Koreas, and pledged to work toward a formal peace on the divided peninsula. After meeting face-to-face in Pyongyang, the North’s capital, where the three-day summit meeting was being held, PresidentRoh Moo-hyunof South Korea and the North’s leader,Kim Jong-il, signed a wide-ranging pact that did not break new ground but built on the path taken during the first summit meeting, in 2000. According to a joint declaration issued Thursday, the two countries said they would seek to put a formal end to the Korean War, which ended in an armistice in 1953. The South pledged to help the impoverished North to build its infrastructure, including a new highway and new freight train service, and to speed up the development of the Kaesong Industrial Economic zone in the North. The two Koreas also said they work toward resolving a long-running maritime dispute in the Yellow Sea. On Wednesday, in unusually straightforward comments made over lunch with his aides, and immediately after a morning meeting with Mr. Kim, Mr. Roh provided insights into the difficulties of negotiating with the North. He talked about the North’s unease over the potential side effects of economic reform. “The North Korean side still has many doubts about the South Korean side,” Mr. Roh said. “I felt that we have to make more efforts to further tear down this wall of distrust.” Mr. Roh said the North was “somewhat upset” about the slow pace of development of the Kaesong Industrial Complex — a special economic zone built by South Korea inside North Korea and the centerpiece of the South’s engagement policy toward the North. At the same time, the South’s reference to Kaesong as the “symbol of reform and openness” clearly made the North’s top leaders uneasy, Mr. Roh said, suggesting that North Korea, like China, was seeking economic growth without political change. “The distrust and reluctance they feel toward the terminologies ‘reform and openness’ is something I felt when talking to Kim Young-nam yesterday and at the meeting with Chairman Kim this morning,” Mr. Roh said, referring first to the North’s No. 2 leader, whom he met Tuesday, and then to Kim Jong-il. The first summit meeting between the Koreas, in June 2000, ushered in a new era of reconciliation between cold war enemies who had taught their children to hate one another for decades. This meeting could serve as a reckoning of the last seven years of the South’s engagement policy toward the North — a policy that the South has hewed to despite the North’s test of missiles and a nuclear device, as well as the Bush administration’s initial hard-line attitude toward Mr. Kim’s government. In South Korea this week there has not been  any of the euphoria of the 2000 meeting, which kept South Koreans glued to their televisions and fundamentally changed their perceptions of the North. This time, the South’s focus was economic, as indicated by the large entourage of business leaders with Mr. Roh. Among South Koreans, there is no longer any heady talk of a quick, German-like, reunification. Instead, they envision a carefully planned, sober process that will make the North less poor and shrink the gap between the Koreas before an eventual reunification, perhaps decades from now. “In general, I support this summit, but I’m a little less enthusiastic than I was in 2000,” said Byun Yoo-seok, 36, a pharmacist enjoying a day off on Wednesday in the Myungdong shopping area here. “I guess I realized that reunification will take a long time.” Lee Choon-won, 79, who was having coffee at a Starbucks with three friends, said: “There’s no emotion this time. It’s no fun. It’s just Roh Moo-hyun doing whatever he’s doing. North Korea got money last time and wants more this time.” Indeed, many South Koreans and the political opposition say they thought that Mr. Roh, long accused of coddling the North,  would give away too much for little in return. He has been trying to set up a meeting with the North ever since he was elected five years ago. But critics say Mr. Roh, a lame duck with only four months left in office, wants to burnish his legacy with an accord and influence the coming presidential election. At the moment, Lee Myung-bak, the candidate for the conservative opposition Grand National Party, has a strong lead in the polls. Mr. Lee supports the engagement policy toward the North and has also talked of offering the North huge economic projects, but he has also emphasized the need for the North to reciprocate on security issues. The North, which has consistently attacked the Grand National Party, is believed to favor a liberal South Korean president. Critics here have accused Mr. Kim of agreeing to this summit meeting in a bid to stir euphoria about reconciliation between the Koreas and  help Mr. Roh’s liberal United New Democratic Party. Over the last five years, Mr. Kim consistently rebuffed the South’s approaches for a second meeting. He said the conditions were not right, apparently referring to the stalled nuclear talks that began moving forward with a softening of Washington’s position early this year. On Wednesday, though, Mr. Kim surprised Mr. Roh by suddenly asking him to extend his visit by one day. Mr. Kim apparently withdrew the invitation after Mr. Roh told his host that he would have to consult his staff. “Can’t a president decide?” Mr. Kim asked in a seemingly teasing manner. “Presidents should be able to decide.” Mr. Roh said, “I can decide on big things, but on little things, I can’t decide.”

SEOUL,South Korea, Oct. 2 — Stepping into the international spotlight at a delicate time for his isolated regime, the reclusive North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, welcomed PresidentRoh Moo-hyunof South Korea to Pyongyang today for three days of talks. It was only the second meeting between leaders of the two Koreas since the country was divided 60 years ago, and Mr. Kim had mobilized a huge crowd to welcome Mr. Roh, who came with offers of peace and economic aid. The North Korean leader himself was dour and reserved, however, in contrast to his effusive manner in 2000, during the first such meeting. Then, broadly smiling, he had hugged Kim Dae-jung, the South Korean president, a scene that softened his image in South Korea and beyond. This morning, Pyongyang’s usually drab sidewalks blossomed in color as North Koreans dressed in their holiday best waved pink and red paper flowers, according to South Korean television images from Pyongyang. Hundreds of thousands of spectators erupted into well-choreographed chants of “hooray” and “unify the fatherland” as Mr. Roh rode through central Pyongyang in an open limousine with Kim Yong-nam, who is the North’s nominal head of state but ranks second to Mr. Kim in power. The two held talks later in the day. Formal talks with Kim Jong-il begin Wednesday. Mr. Roh travels with a bold initiative: IfNorth Koreaagrees to work toward reducing a half century of animosity with arms cuts, the South will help rebuild the North’s moribund economy, creating a “joint economic community” as a prelude to eventual reunification. Mr. Roh will also test Mr. Kim’s willingness to give up his nuclear arsenal in return for economic rewards and diplomatic relations with the United States and other countries. Mr. Roh’s aides believe that the summit meeting, together with recent progress in six-nation talks on North Korea’s nuclear disarmament, is a sign that the North is cautiously embracing more cooperation and reform. But some analysts warn that the meeting may also be another tactical move by Mr. Kim to obtain more economic concessions without giving up nuclear weapons. Mr. Kim, 65, was unsmiling as the two leaders exchanged a businesslike handshake and a terse “Nice to meet you” in front of a cultural hall in Pyongyang, where Mr. Roh’s motorcade stopped for a welcoming ceremony. Clad in his trademark khaki tunic, Mr. Kim walked down a red carpet, guiding the South Korean leader past a parade of North Korean soldiers goose-stepping with bayonet-tipped rifles. Appearing before a live international audience, the pudgy Mr. Kim dispelled recent news reports that he was so sick that he could hardly walk. Besides an expected aid package, Mr. Roh’s visit brings a propaganda bonus to the Kim government, which cannot feed its people without foreign aid but boasts that its nuclear arsenal compels respect from the rest of the world. The North’s state propagandists have described visits by foreign leaders, including former  President Jimmy Carter in 1994 and  Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in 2000, as paying tribute to their “Great Leader.” In his journey to Pyongyang early today, Mr. Roh drove three and a half hours from Seoul, the South Korean capital. He was accompanied by industry leaders, politicians, cultural figures and scholars. About 30 miles north of Seoul, Mr. Roh stepped out of his vehicle to make the symbolic gesture of walking across the border that divides the Koreas. He was the first South Korean leader to cross it on foot. In 2000, Kim Dae-jung flew to Pyongyang. “This line is a wall that has divided the nation for a half-century,” Mr. Roh said, as he stepped across a yellow strip with the words “peace and prosperity” written on it. Our people have suffered from too many hardships, and development has been held up due to this wall. This line will be gradually erased and the wall will fall.” Before leaving Seoul, Mr. Roh said he would strive for “substantive and concrete progress that will bring about a peace settlement together with economic development.” The two Koreas remain technically at war since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a cease-fire, and that status is considered by many South Koreans as a root cause of tension on the divided peninsula. Mr. Roh said he would use his visit to help make progress in six-nation talks, where regional powers have been trying for years to end the North’s nuclear weapons programs. United States officials warn that any attempt to replace the Korean armistice with a formal peace treaty — a process that would involve the United States and China, both parties to the Korean War — must be preceded by progress in nuclear talks. “I certainly am not looking for those inter-Korean discussions to change the basic facts on the ground or the six-party talks,” Tom Casey, the  State Department spokesman, said Monday. This week’s summit meeting comes almost exactly a year after the North tested a nuclear bomb, rattling regional stability and persuading the Bush administration to abandon its earlier policy of not engaging a government it had earlier vilified as part of the “axis of evil.” Since then, North Korea has shut down its nuclear reactor, its main source of weapons-grade plutonium, and has tentatively agreed to disable its nuclear facilities by the end of the year. But the North Koreans have not firmly committed themselves to the more difficult aspects of denuclearization: providing full details of their programs, dismantling their programs and giving up actual stores of fissile material and weapons. Despite widely voiced doubts over what the talks this week can accomplish, the South Korean government insists that a face-to-face meeting with Mr. Kim, whose words carry ultimate authority, can help clarify the North’s intentions. “Kim Jong-il must make a strategic decision. How long is the North going to beg rice, fertilizer and other aid from the international community?” said Lee Su-hoon, chairman of Seoul’s Presidential Committee on Northeast Cooperation Initiative, before he accompanied Roh to Pyongyang. “Kim Jong-il must seize this opportunity.” By appearing more forthcoming, analysts in South Korea say, Mr. Kim can encourage a new movement in Washington to engage his Communist government and make it easier for South Korea and China to continue providing financial support. But if Mr. Roh promises economic aid without winning tangible concessions, he may stoke criticism that unilateral aid only shores up Mr. Kim’s repressive system. Conservative political opposition in Seoul have called the trip a gambit by Mr. Roh to create a “unification euphoria” to help sway votes in the presidential election set for this December. Mr. Roh is barred by running again for president, but opinion surveys show that liberal candidates favored by him are lagging far behind the main opposition candidate, Lee Myung-bak.

Saturday’s reunion between families separated by the North and South Korea divide was the first in more than a year.

==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — Hundreds of South Koreans, separated from family members inNorth Koreafor more than half a century, were reunited with their relatives on Saturday as a Red Cross gathering got under way at the Diamond Mountain resort in the North. The South Koreans arrived with gym bags and suitcases bulging with goods suggested by the Red Cross, daily amenities that are scarce in the impoverished North — sugar, soap, underwear, aspirin, toothpaste and toothbrushes, vitamins, wool socks, even sacks of rice. Some South Koreans also took United States dollars, even though gifts of currency were discouraged by the organizers. A brief exchange of gunfire between North and South Korean troops on Friday night did not delay or cancel the event. No one was injured in the cross-border shooting, an official with the Defense Ministry said, and analysts in Seoul said they believed that the initial shots, from the North, were probably accidental. The reunion that began Saturday was the first in more than a year. It was to continue until Tuesday, and a second group of relatives is scheduled to begin another meeting from Wednesday to Friday. About 100 families from each country will meet up with one or more relatives. Most families became separated during the 1950-53 Korean War, essentially becoming stranded on opposite sides of the border when the fighting stopped. Virtually no communication channels exist for average North and South Koreans. There is no inter-Korean travel  and both governments block telephone, Internet and postal services. Oh Seung-geun, 76, a former South Korean Air Force captain, waited 15 years to be chosen for a reunion. He said he got a call from the Red Cross two weeks ago telling him he had been approved to go to Diamond Mountain, and he was hoping to see two sisters, a younger brother and a cousin. “Even if only one of them shows up,” he said, “my heart will be open.” The meetings can be thrilling and joyful, or  awkward and tense, say those who have attended. Both delegations have “minders” who monitor conversations, and many North Koreans feel unable to speak freely with the regime’s authorities nearby. Wealthier relatives from the South can be too persistent in asking about the daily deprivations and oppressive political life in the North. “I know the North Korean regime, I grew up with that system,” said Mr. Oh, who was born in Pyongyang, the North’s capital, in 1934. “If I talk about certain things, it could be perilous for my family.” The current reunion is the 18th  since 2000. Nearly 21,000 South Koreans have been reunited with relatives so far, the Red Cross said, including about 4,000  connected through video conferencing. Meanwhile, 88,000 South Koreans are on a Red Cross waiting list. But time is running out; about half the South Korean applicants are now over  80. The family reunions have become a highly politicized issue for the North and the South alike. The historian James A. Foley, in his book about separated Korean families and cross-border reunions, detailed the “long history of both sides’ manipulation of the divided families issue for their own political gains.” The South has pressed the North for larger and more frequent reunions, but negotiations broke down last week, and the future of the reunions remained unclear. The talks ended as North Korea, through its Red Cross team, requested donations of 500,000 tons of rice and 300,000 tons of fertilizer. South Korean Red Cross officials said they were not authorized to agree to so much aid, and analysts said the conservative government of President Lee Myung-bak was unlikely to grant the request.

SEOUL, South Korea — A request byNorth Koreaon Tuesday for huge shipments of fertilizer and half a million tons of rice has derailed talks about further reunions of Korean families who were separated by the Korean War. The demand  came on the final day of two-day talks between Red Cross delegations from both countries in the North Korean border town of Kaesong.South Koreahad hoped that the talks would lead to larger, more regular and more frequent reunions between family members who became separated during the 1950-3 conflict. But a South Korean Red Cross official in Kaesong told reporters that  his group did not have the authority to approve such a large amount of aid. The comments of the unidentified official,  werereportedby the Yonhap News Agency in Seoul. About 21,000 South Koreans have been able to meet with North Korean relatives over the last 10 years. The latest round of reunions is to begin Saturday, with members of 100 families meeting at the Diamond Mountain resort in the North. The reunions are a deeply important political issue in South Korea, while the North has used them as leverage for political and economic concessions. “Oh, yes, these reunions are very, very political,” said Oh Seung-geun, 76, a former Air Force captain from Seoul who is hoping to meet a brother and two sisters at the coming reunion. He has not seen them since December 1950, when they were separated by fighting in their hometown, Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. “This is not a humanitarian event at all,” Mr. Oh said. “Both countries use it for their own propaganda and political purposes.” More than 80,000 South Koreans — most of them over 70 years old — are still waiting for some sort of contact with relatives in the North. Most do not even know if their family members there are still alive. Even basic communications like telephone calls, letters and Internet messages are prohibited or blocked by the two governments. The conservative South Korean government of President Lee Myung-bak has linked future large-scale aid deliveries to North Korean progress on denuclearization, a process that fell apart when North Korea walked away from international talks. Mr. Lee’s government didsend some humanitarian aidto North Korea  this week — small shipments of rice and noodles — but they were the first such deliveries since he was elected in early 2008. North Korea also reportedly demanded this week that the South permit a resumption of tours to the Diamond Mountain resort. Those tours, which earn Pyongyang millions of dollars in hard currency each year, were suspended two years ago when a South Korean woman was shot and killed by a North Korean guard. The North said the woman had ventured into a restricted zone and ignored repeated warnings from the guard. The South, which has demanded a fuller investigation, stopped the tours. North Korea responded by seizing several South Korean-owned facilities at the resort, including the center where the family reunions are held. Relations deteriorated further this spring when a South Korean naval vessel, theCheonan, was sunk and 46 sailors were killed. Seoul has blamed the sinking on a North Korean torpedo attack, but Pyongyang has denied any role in the event.

SEOUL, South Korea — In a surprise gesture of reconciliation that could ease tensions on the divided Korean Peninsula,North Koreaproposed toSouth Koreaon Saturday that they arrange reunions of families separated by a war six decades ago. Family reunions have usually been proposed by the South, not the North. The North’s initiative showed how the humanitarian program is used as a chip in the complex diplomacy surrounding the peninsula. But the South has refused to resume aid shipments or six-nation talks on endingNorth Korea’s nuclear weaponsdevelopment before North Korea apologizes for thesinking of a South Korean warshipin March, which killed 46 sailors. The North has denied involvement in the sinking, but the South has insisted on the North making gestures to mollify South Koreans. The proposal came a day before Stephen W. Bosworth, Washington’s top envoy on North Korea, was to arrive in Seoul in the first leg of a regional trip aimed at resuming the nuclear talks. South Korea was “favorably” reviewing the offer for immediate discussions of family reunions so the reunions could take place in North Korea’s Diamond Mountain resort around the Sept. 22 Chuseok fall-harvest holiday, a government statement said. About 20,000 Koreans have been temporarily reunited since the two Koreas held their first summit meeting in 2000. The last such reunions were a year ago, and thousands of older South Koreans wait for a chance to meet relatives  not seen for 60 years. The scenes of teary people hugging long-lost parents and children have previously helped sway South Korean opinion in favor of engaging the North. Meanwhile, North Korea has used the reunions to win economic concessions from the South. Although the new proposal is a sharp departure from the North’s recent invectives against South Korea, it remains unclear whether the South considers it enough to change a stance hardened by the warship’s sinking. “We wonder about the North’s motive behind this unexpected proposal, but whatever it might be, we must say we welcome the offer,” Ahn Hyoung-hwan, a governing party spokesman in Seoul, told reporters. Opposition parties also welcomed the  initiative. China, the North’s main ally and the leader of the six-nation nuclear talks, urged both Koreas to shift from confrontation to dialogue by rejoining the talks. Although Washington stood by the South, a crucial Asian ally, in the standoff over the ship sinking, and vowed to keep sanctions on the North, it is also looking for ways to bring North Korea back to the talks, a central part of its global nonproliferation efforts. “We believe it would be critical for there to be some element of reconciliation between the North and South for any process to move forward,” Kurt M. Campbell, a United States assistant secretary of state, said Thursday. The six-nation talks were last held in December 2008. South Korean officials have voiced a deep skepticism of the talks. Without a concrete North Korean commitment to denuclearization, any such talks would simply give North Korea a tool to weaken an international resolve to enforce sanctions on the North while buying time to perfect its nuclear arsenal, they said. After making various threats, North Korea has recently begun offering conciliatory gestures. Last month, itfreed an imprisoned Americanduring former President Jimmy Carter’s diplomatic trip to Pyongyang. It also released a seven-man crew of a South Korean fishing boat seized a month ago. The North’s proposal for reunions came as the South was considering how much aid it should provide for North Koreans devastated by floods. In an interview with Russia 24-TV on Friday during a visit to Russia, President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea offered to build a second joint industrial park in North Korea if the North changed its policy.

President Obama said Saturday that the United States would retain control of all military forces in the South during any conflict on the Korean Peninsula.

TORONTO — In its strongest move since the sinking of a South Korean warship, the Obama administration said Saturday that the United States would retain control of all military forces in the South during any conflict withNorth Korea, which has been widely blamed for the attack on the ship in March that killed 46 sailors. The announcement was an apparent attempt to signal to the North, which has long wanted American forces off the peninsula,  that the United States would remain firmly in control of military operations if war were to break out. The decision is somewhat symbolic; the United States was not slated to give up wartime control of South Korean troops until 2012, and the new agreement extends the deadline to 2015. But the agreement allowed Washington and Seoul to take some action after months of struggling for ways to punish the North — and attempt to deter it from further violence — without provoking the country’s erratic leader, Kim Jong-il, to launch new attacks. “There have to be consequences for such irresponsible behavior on the international stage,” Mr. Obama said Saturday during a press conference with President Lee Myung-bak ofSouth Koreaon the sidelines of an economic summit. The difficulty of taking action against the North was underscored earlier in the day when the leaders of the world’s largest industrialized economies and Russia — the so-calledGroup of 8— condemned the sinking of the South Korean vessel, theCheonan, without explicitly blaming North Korea. An investigation by South Korea and investigators from several other countries firmly placed responsibility for the attack on North Korea, but neither China nor Russia has embraced that conclusion. China is not part of the G-8, but is a dominant force in the G-20. The G-8 said in a communiqué, “We support the Republic of Korea in its efforts to seek accountability for the Cheonan incident.” Mr. Obama also used the press conference to announce  that President Hu Jintao of China had accepted an invitation to pay a state visit to the United States. The news came just days after China said it would allow greater flexibility in the value of its currency. In addition, Mr. Obama vowed to seek Congressional ratification for a long-stalled free-trade agreement with South Korea — a possibly risky political move that could please businesses but upset unions and their allies in Congress. In an apparent attempt to satisfy those groups, the administration said that  in exchange for pushing the trade deal forward, Mr. Obama  would ask the South to drop restrictions on auto and beef imports; the restrictions have  been particularly  unpopular with unions. The decision to seek approval of the trade agreement was a victory for the White House economic team, and  the chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, who supported it over the misgivings of Mr. Obama’s political advisers, who worry about angering allies in the months before the critical midterm elections.. Mr. Obama’s aides said they would try to resolve lingering issues by the time of the next G-20 leaders’ talks, to be held in Seoul, South Korea, in November, and present the deal to Congress shortly after the November elections. President George W. Bush’s administration negotiated the agreement in June 2007, but Congress has not acted on it, nor has the Obama administration pressed the issue until now. “President Obama’s leadership in breaking down barriers to commerce couldn’t come at a better time,” said Vikram S. Pandit, the chief executive of Citigroup, who leads a coalition of businesses that have urged ratification of the agreement. He said that the agreement “should lead to increased trade and investments, driving growth and job creation to fuel our economic recovery.” Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he would support ratification as long as “the unscientific barriers Korea has erected against American beef” were removed. Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, the top Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, said he welcomed the decision. “I hope that this process will provide us an opportunity to address market access for autos and beef and increase the value of the trading relationship,” he said.

There is no excuse for North Korea’s attack on a South Korean navy ship, but military retaliation would be disastrous for both countries.
==::==
2010-05-21T00:00:00Z
==::==
Nearly 60 years ago, the Korean War concluded with an armistice. North Korea’s attack on a South Korean navy ship, which killed 46 sailors, is a reminder of the continued fragility and danger of that less-than-peace. The two Koreas have more than one million troops on their border and the North has thousands of artillery tubes pointed at Seoul. With an erratic (that’s generous) leader like Kim Jong-il in Pyongyang, the risk of miscalculation is very high. The fact that Mr. Kim also has nuclear weapons makes it all the more frightening. South Korea deserves credit for its prudent response to the late March sinking of the Cheonan, which was sailing in disputed waters. Instead of lashing back, it assembled an international team of experts to determine the cause. On Thursday,the government produced forensic evidencethat a torpedo sank the ship, including part of a torpedo propeller with what the investigative team says is a North Korean serial number. The North’s rejection of the findings as a fabrication “orchestrated by the group of traitors” was predictable. There can be no excuse for this act of aggression. We understand South Korea’s grief and anger. But military retaliation would be disastrous for both countries. The international community — and most importantly, China — must move quickly to stop things from spinning out of control. It is impossible to know what will change North Korea’s behavior. It has already shrugged off two rounds of United Nations Security Council sanctions since it first detonated a nuclear device in 2006. Still, the Security Council must quickly condemn this barbarism. The North is not invulnerable. It is hugely dependent on China for fuel and food imports. Beijing needs to immediately condemn the attack and have even tougher private talks with Mr. Kim and his cronies — making clear that its patience and patronage are running out. China wants to be a world leader but is refusing to act like one. On Thursday, it urged both Koreas to exercise restraint but failed to blame the North. On her visit to Beijing this weekend, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton needs to leave no doubt that China’s goal of a stable Korean peninsula will never be realized this way. The United States and South Korea are also considering imposing new bilateral sanctions on the North. Washington may reinstate North Korea on its “terrorism” list. That may quiet some of the fury in Seoul (and Washington), but we’re doubtful it will have much impact in Pyongyang, especially when China is so determined to offset any losses. The United States must ensure that South Korea has the capability and training to deter future attacks. That means more joint naval exercises and a full investigation of how a modern ship — configured for antisubmarine warfare — was caught off-guard and sunk. Washington and Seoul must not close the door on six-party negotiations, which have not met for more than a year. China will have to use its leverage — we suggest a suspension of oil deliveries — to get Pyongyang back to the table. We know the talks are a very long shot. They are probably the only chance to peacefully curb North Korea’s nuclear program and finally end the Korean war.

Seoul is downplaying the Cheonan sinking. Perhaps it has no choice.

SEOUL — On the evening of March 26, Cheonan, a 1,200-ton South Korean corvette, was on patrol in coastal waters near the disputed border with North Korea when its stern was suddenly torn away by a powerful explosion. The warship sank within a few minutes, taking the lives of 46 sailors. The South Korean government initially assumed the warship was attacked by a North Korean submarine and put its military on high alert. However, the next morning the South Korean government began to work hard to dismiss or at least downplay the probability of a North Korean attack. President Lee Myung-bak and his officials warned against “premature conclusions” and emphasized that there was no definite evidence linking the Cheonan disaster to North Korea. They might  be  right: despite occasional bouts of bellicose rhetoric, North Korea is currently in a negotiating mood (that is, seeking to squeeze more money from the outside world). But the evidence points to an external explosion roughly equivalent to that of 180 kilograms of TNT, so a mine or torpedo are the most plausible explanations. If so, why is the Seoul government dismissing such an option? There are good reasons for this. If North Korean involvement was established, the Seoul government would face a hard choice: it would have to retaliate or be seen as spineless. This is a lose-lose situation for South Korea, since it has no way of “punishing” the North. Full-scale war is out of the question. The  military balance leaves almost no doubt that a war would be won by the South (with some American involvement), but the price of victory would be unacceptably high. The Seoul metropolitan area, home to half of South Korea’s population, lies within  range of a heavy concentration of North Korean artillery.  A massive artillery barrage would leave many thousands dead and devastate vital parts of the country. Any advance  north across difficult and heavily fortified mountainous terrain would also be very costly — not to mention the costs of postwar reconstruction. So nothing short of a massive North Korean attack on major population centers in the South would likely be seen by Seoul as sufficient cause for a large-scale military operation. Limited actions, such as raids against the North Korean naval and military installations, would make the Seoul government look strong in the eyes of voters, but would create many problems for which the same voters would soon start blaming the government. Plus, such raids are useless. Kim Jong Il and his henchmen would not lose sleep  if they learned that a few dozen North Korean sailors or soldiers were killed in a South Korean attack. In the North, even the death of many thousands is politically irrelevant so long as they are not members of Kim’s inner circle. At the same time, such raids would scare investors away from South Korea and damage its financial rating. Financial sanctions, such as closing the Kaesong industrial park, a joint South-North economic development, or freezing the few remaining exchange projects, might seem attractive at first glance, but in the long run could be counterproductive. Contrary to some assumptions, the Kaesong park and other exchange projects are damaging for Kim Jong Il, since they represent a potentially dangerous contact with the outside world. Without any means of retaliating, Lee Myung-bak’s administration may have decided to play down the likelihood of North Korea’s involvement or at least portray it as one of several possible explanations. Whether North Korea was involved or not,  the Cheonan affair is  a sober reminder that if North Korea did choose to become aggressive again, not much could be done to counter it. Partial operations might be impressive but are inefficient, and large-scale retaliation  would likely be quietly blocked by the South Koreans. This is understandable — they’re the ones who live on the front line.

SEOUL, South Korea — The North Korean military fired shells for the second straight day on Thursday into  waters near the disputed western sea border withSouth Korea, asserting its territorial claims in the most volatile section of the inter-Korean frontier. After lobbing dozens of shells on Wednesday, North Korean shore guns roared again on a foggy Thursday morning in what the North called a routine military exercise, said a spokesman at the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the South Korean military, who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing his office’s policy. An unknown  number of shells splashed into North Korean waters just north of the so-called Northern Limit Line, a sea border  drawn by the United Nations at the end of the 1950-3 Korean War but never accepted by the North. North Koreaoften conducts artillery exercises off its southwestern coast, which faces a string of islands  occupied by South Korean marines. But the latest barrages raised hackles in South Korea because the shells landed in waters only a mile north of the sea border, which the South Koreans consider a legitimate demarcation. South Korea was slow to reveal details of the shelling. In unconfirmed  reports on Thursday, South Korean news outlets reported that North Korea also launched rockets as well as artillery during its Wednesday barrages. North Korean rockets and artillery massed near the border remain a potent threat to the South because its capital, Seoul, lies within their range. In Washington, the State Department spokesman, P. J. Crowley, called the North Korean moves “provocative” and “not helpful.”

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreathreatened Monday to fire shells into waters off the west coast of the divided Korean Peninsula, as a way to enforce its claims to an area currently held by the South. Such an action would seriously worsen tensions along the disputed western sea border, the site ofa naval skirmish between the Koreasin November.South Koreaimmediately warned that it would “resolutely respond to any North Korean provocation.” When the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, rather than a permanent peace treaty, the warring militaries failed to agree upon a western sea border. The American-led United Nations forces unilaterally drew the “Northern Limit Line,” a border the South Korean and United States militaries have enforced since the end of the war. But North Korea never accepted it, insisting on a border far south of the United Nations line that cuts deep into waters currently patrolled and fished by the South. The two Korean navies have clashed in the disputed waters in 1999, 2002 and in November, when navy patrol ships from the two Koreas exchanged fire in the area, leaving one North Korean sailor dead and three others wounded, according to the South. North Korea regularly warns of possible conflict in the area to highlight its demand that the United States open talks to sign a peace treaty. On Monday, the North Korean Navy declared that South Korean-controlled waters above the border the North has drawn for itself were a “peacetime naval firing zone of coastal and island artillery units.” The announcement deepened a long-held South Korean fear that the North Korean military might conduct firing exercises in the disputed waters to enforce its territorial claim. All South Korean “fishing boats and warships should take measures in that zone to protect themselves,” the North Korean naval command said in a statement, carried by the country’s official Korean Central News Agency. North Korea accused the South of “reckless military provocations” in the area, citing South Korean warships’ operating and conducting military drills in waters it claims. “We consider the North’s absurd argument regrettable,” the South Korean Navy said in a statement, vowing to defend the Northern Limit Line. “We express a very serious concern that the North’s threat could unnecessarily heighten tensions.” Meanwhile, the South Korean military said on Tuesday that its patrol boats had found seven North Koreans drifting in a small boat in South Korean-controlled waters near the disputed sea border on Monday. While officials were interrogating them, the national news agency Yonhap quoted unnamed government sources as saying that the North Koreans told them they drifted to the South by accident while fishing and wanted to return home. North Korea’s threats came two weeks after Stephen W. Bosworth, President Obama’s special envoy,visited Pyongyangto try to persuade North Korea to return to six-nation talks on ending itsnuclear weaponsprogram. Both Washington and Pyongyang reported progress during Mr. Bosworth’s trip but said more talks were needed before being able to say whether the six-nation talks would resume.

SEOUL — Kim Jong Il, the leader of North Korea, met the head of South Korea’s Hyundai Group, the North’s state media reported Sunday, days after the communist country released a Hyundai worker who had been held there for months. Kim and Hyun Jung-eun, Hyundai’s chairwoman, had a “cordial talk,” the Korean Central News Agency said in a brief dispatch from Pyongyang that provided few details. It did not specify when the talks took place, though they were likely held Sunday since Hyun had extended her stay in the North for an additional day, the fifth time since arriving in Pyongyang last Monday. Hyun traveled to North Korea’s capital to seek the release of the Hyundai worker as well as discuss joint projects the business group has pursued in the North that have stalled amid sharply higher inter-Korean tensions. North Korea on Thursday deported Yoo Seong-jin, a 44-year-old Hyundai Asan technician who worked at a joint industrial zone in the North where about 110 South Korean-run factories employ about 40,000 North Korean workers. Yoo had been held for allegedly denouncing the North’s government and attempting to persuade a North Korean worker to defect. North Korea still holds four South Korean fishermen it detained earlier this month after their boat strayed into its waters. Chung Ju-yung, the late Hyundai Group founder and Hyun’s father-in-law, pushed aggressively for closer business ties with North Korea beginning in the late 1990s.

South Korean officials have detected “brisk” activity at a North Korean nuclear test site, a South Korean newspaper reported Thursday, citing an unidentified South Korean government official. Last week, the North said it would carry out a second nuclear test and test launch intercontinental ballistic missiles unless theUnited Nations Security Councilapologized for criticizing the country’s April 5 rocket launching. The South Korean newspaper,Chosun Ilbo, reportedthat the authorities in Seoul were monitoring the movements of personnel and vehicles at a nuclear site in the northeastern county of Kilju, where the North conducted its first nuclear test in 2006. The paper quoted an unidentified South Korean government official as saying that the North was believed to be preparing to conduct a nuclear test soon. The paper did not say howSouth Koreaobtained the intelligence. Officials at the Defense Ministry, Foreign Ministry and the National Intelligence Service said they could not confirm the report.

SEOUL,South Korea—North Koreaaccused the South of tampering with a border marker on Wednesday and warned of a possible clash along the heavily fortified frontier. The warning comes as South Korea’s relations with the North are at one of their lowest points in years. A day earlier, the two nations held their first official dialogue in more than a year. But the meeting ended in 22 minutes, during which North Korea told the South that if it wanted to continue to run factories in a joint industrial complex in North Korea, it should pay more for the North Korean labor. On Wednesday, North Korea accused the South Korean military of moving one of the 1,292 borderline markers several dozen yards to the north. In the latest bombastic blast, it called the move a “serious military provocation” and said it would take an unspecified “measure for self-defense and the South Korean warmongers will be held entirely accountable for all the ensuing consequences” unless the marker was restored. The South Korean military dismissed the North Korean claim and called it part of a tactic to raise tensions. In 1999 and 2002, North Korea used border disputes to launch naval skirmishes with the South. Over the weekend, North Korea warned that South Korea “should not forget that Seoul is only 50 kilometers,” or about 31 miles, from the border and within the range of what Gen. Walter Sharp, the commander of American forces in South Korea, called on Wednesday “the world’s largest artillery force.” North Korea has about 8,500 artillery pieces and 5,100 rockets aimed at South Korea, many of them deployed just north of Seoul, according to the Defense Ministry in Seoul. Since President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea took office last year with a pledge not to provide free aid until the North cooperated on its nuclear disarmament, the North has steadily raised tensions along the border. It tried to show the South that Mr. Lee’s tough line on the North had a cost — a tactic the North demonstrated again during the inter-Korean talks on Tuesday at Kaesong, a North Korean border town that is the site of the joint industrial park. During the meeting, the North spurned a South Korean demand for the release of a South Korean worker who has been held for almost  a month in Kaesong on charges of denouncing the North Korean government. Instead, the North called for talks to raise the wages of 39,000 North Koreans working for the South Korean factories there. They are now paid about $70 a month. Unification Minister Hyun In-taek said Wednesday that his government would “carefully study” the North Korean demand. Rising tensions present a test for Mr. Lee. He wants to do something his predecessors had refrained from out of fear of provoking the North: join an American-led operation to crack down on the North’s suspected illicit arms trade. Mr. Lee said he would join the so-called Proliferation Security Initiative when the United Nations asked for tightened sanctions on North Korea after its recent rocket launching. But he has delayed an announcement as North Korea warned that it would consider such a move a “declaration of war.” Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia is to arrive in Pyongyang, the North’s capital, on Thursday. He was expected to discuss the North’s threat to boycott nuclear disarmament talks and restart a plant that made weapons-grade plutonium.

SEOUL,South Korea—North Koreaand the United States made significant progress on Tuesday toward ending an impasse in talks aimed at revealing the full scale of the North’s nuclear weapons programs and dismantling them, top negotiators from both countries said. “Depending on what we hear back from capitals by tomorrow, I think there will be some further announcements very soon,” Assistant Secretary of State, Christopher R. Hill told reporters after his meeting with his North Korean counterpart in Singapore. “We did as much as we could do,” Mr. Hill said. “We addressed all the issues we needed to address.” Before entering talks with Kim Kye-gwan, the North Korean negotiator, Mr. Hill warned that time was running out as Washington and its allies waited for North Korea to clarify whether it would submit what Mr. Hill called a “complete and correct” accounting of its nuclear weapons activities. Pyongyang’s reluctance to offer such a declaration has delayed six-nation nuclear disarmament talks for more than three months. “There was a considerable narrowing of differences in view,” Mr. Kim was quoted as saying by South Korean reporters in Singapore after his talks with Mr. Hill. Under a February 2007 agreement, North Korea agreed to give a complete accounting of its nuclear activities by the end of last year. It has said that it fulfilled its commitment last November. But Washington insists that North Korea failed to clarify whether it had pursued a secret uranium-enrichment program in addition to its known weapons program based on plutonium and whether it has provided nuclear technology to countries like Syria. North Korea has repeatedly denied having a uranium-enrichment program or providing nuclear expertise or materials to Syria. But Mr. Hill has been trying to get North Korea to at least acknowledge such the validity of such suspicions, according to officials in Seoul, who spoke on the condition of anonymity given the delicacy of the talks. It remained unclear whether Mr. Hill had succeeded in winning North Korea’s full cooperation in verifying Washington’s suspicions or had settled for vague terminology to keep the talks going. North Korea has been trying hard to get Washington to remove it from an annual State Department list of countries that sponsor terrorism. Getting off that list would help North Korea tap into international finance resources that could bolster its impoverished economy. Mr. Hill said he hoped to reconvene the six-nation talks as soon as possible. The talks also include South Korea, Japan, Russia and China. Tension on the heavily armed Korean peninsula have increased in recent days after North Korea tested short-range missiles and made threats against South Korea.

Scenes from a recent visit to Kaesong, North Korea, during a rare period of relative openness in a country which strictly controls even the glimpses it provides of itself to the outside.
==::==

==::==
KAESONG,North Korea— Under the gaze of a bronze statue of Kim Il-sung standing atop a hill, a convoy of 11 buses packed with South Koreans wound its way through this quiet city center in North Korea, which was opened up to daily tours early in December and is now suddenly host to hundreds of mostly South Korean tourists seven days a week. Bus No. 1 came to a halt at a street corner, temporarily blocking two middle-aged North Korean women from crossing the street and producing a telling moment in the short history of tourism in the North. Finding themselves only feet away from North Koreans — real, live North Koreans who were neither guides nor minders — the South Korean tourists stared at the two women outside, some even pressing their noses against the bus windows. The two women, wearing gray overcoats and the kind of high-heeled boots that seemed to be in fashion here, smiled in embarrassment. Then they waved at the South Korean tourists, who waved back just as the bus started moving. And so went a recent visit to Kaesong, the product of a rare period of relative openness in the North, which strictly controls even the glimpses it provides of itself to the outside. Waved to, most women waved back. Men nodded. Schoolchildren, who could be seen going about unaccompanied by adults, did not fail to return a wave. Although the North missed its year-end deadline to declare all of its nuclear activities and disable its main nuclear site, it seems to be on track to do so eventually. Its improving relations with the United States were punctuated recently by the announcement that theNew York Philharmonicwould play in Pyongyang, the capital, in February, at North Korea’s invitation. Entry by foreigners to Pyongyang tends to be strictly controlled. But the tours to Kaesong, like those to the Mount Kumgang area in North Korea’s southeastern section, are open to all foreigners, including journalists, as long as they pay the fee of about $180 for a one-day trip. The Mount Kumgang area has received outsiders for almost a decade now, but it remains a Potemkin-like resort fenced off from surrounding villages. By contrast, Kaesong is a real city, one that, judging from the hand-painted wooden traffic signs and total absence of cars on its often unpaved streets, the authorities have not tried to transform into a Pyongyang-like showcase. An ancient capital that eventually fell to the North during the Korean War, Kaesong lies just north of the demilitarized zone dividing the Korean Peninsula and is a two-hour drive from Seoul. It is considered richer than other parts of the North because thousands of its residents work in a South Korean-run special industrial zone just outside the city. The tours here start in Seoul around 6 a.m. and are run by Hyundai Asan, the South Korean company that developed the industrial zone and is planning to start regular tours to Mount Paektu, along the North’s border with China, and possibly to Pyongyang next spring. One morning last week, most of the tourists were elderly South Koreans, though they included the young as well as non-Koreans. Once inside North Korea, South Korean guides reminded the tourists that taking photographs from inside the bus, or of anything but approved tourist spots, was forbidden. The convoy went up the highway alongside the expanding special industrial zone and past hills denuded of trees. “Let’s get rid of U.S. imperialism!” read a red-and-white banner on the side of a building next to the highway. The first stop was Pakyon Falls. South Korean tourists posed for photos in front of the 121-foot waterfall, many of them trying to get the falls as well as a North Korean guide holding a big white bullhorn in the same picture. “Take a picture with the waterfall,” the guide told one man who had mustered up the courage to ask her directly to pose for him. At a stall selling drinks, though, a saleswoman dressed in a Christmassy pink fur-collared costume welcomed photographs and said flirtatiously that she should be paid a modeling fee. “Ginseng tea? Coffee?” she offered. One of the many North Korean guides traveling inside the buses came over. Smiling broadly, the guide, who was in his 40s, said he had been dispatched from Pyongyang to help out with Kaesong’s opening. “It would be good to normalize relations with the United States,” he said, expressing an opinion repeated by two other guides. “We could focus our resources on developing our economy. From the U.S. perspective, it would no longer be threatened by our nuclear arms.” “Our relations began improving after our nuclear tests last year,” he added, dragging on a cigarette. “The U.S. is basically afraid of nuclear proliferation, and we showed them who we are.” Another guide, in his 30s, said normalization would allow North Korea to shift its resources from defense so that it could become an “economic power.” Compared with guides at Mount Kumgang or the Kaesong industrial complex a couple of years ago, some of the guides here, who wore elegant long overcoats and scarves, were indistinguishable from their South Korean counterparts. “I also sell fresh mountain water,” the woman at the stall said in a sing-song voice. “I even sell hangover pills.” One bus was filled with South Koreans who had grown up in Kaesong and were returning for the first time in six decades. Everything had changed, they said, except the very same tourist spots they were visiting. On the steps leading to Sungyang, a Confucian lecture hall, another North Korean guide with a white bullhorn was dramatically interrupted by an old man who jabbed a large finger in the air and yelled out: “Why isn’t there a nameplate on the entrance? Every Korean house should have a nameplate.” Flustered, the guide remained speechless as the South Koreans streamed past  her into the hall. Inside, though, she said, “The Japanese imperialists took the nameplate and burned it during the occupation.” Later, the man with the large finger, Lee Hee-tae, 80, who had lived here until the Korean War, said he was dissatisfied with the answer. “I don’t think the Japanese took it,” he said, “because I saw it after the end of the Japanese occupation.” Overhearing his comments, a young North Korean guide asked, “Is there anything wrong?” After listening to Mr. Lee’s explanation, the guide said simply, “I can’t believe you remember what happened 60 years ago.”

The leaders of North and South Korea will hold their second-ever summit meeting in Pyongyang this month.

TOKYO, Wednesday, Aug. 8 — The two Koreas announced Wednesday morning that they would hold a summit meeting later this month, the first since a groundbreaking meeting in 2000 began an ongoing reconciliation process on the Korean peninsula. President Roh Moo-hyun ofSouth Koreawill meet the North’s leader, Kim Jong-il, during a three-day meeting Aug. 28 to Aug. 30 in Pyongyang,North Korea’s capital, the two Korean governments said in coordinated announcements. The North said the meeting will carry “weighty significance in opening a new phase of peace,” according to the government’s Korean Central News Agency. The South, using similar language, added that the meeting would “provide momentum to settle the North Korean nuclear problem.” Neither side released details about the agenda, and it was not clear how much can realistically be accomplished because the deeply unpopular Mr. Roh has only a few months left in office. The meeting, which had been rumored for months, was immediately criticized by South Korea’s political opposition as a ploy to influence the presidential election in December. The trip by Mr. Roh is widely expected to boost the popularity of liberal presidential candidates who share his engagement policy toward the North. While the main opposition Grand National Party also favors engaging North Korea, its candidates call for tougher concessions from the North. Two Grand National Party candidates, Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye,  lead in polls for the election. “This summit is about politics between North and South Korea,” Nam Sung-wook, a North Korea expert at Korea University, said in a telephone interview from Seoul. “It is unlikely to solve the nuclear problem because North Korea has consistently argued that it is a problem between North Korea and the United States.” Still, South Korea said the North had agreed to the meeting because of the recent progress in negotiations over the North’s nuclear program. The North shut down its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon last month, and talks are continuing over its entire nuclear program. In 2000, Kim Jong-il and the previous South Korean president, Kim Dae-jung, met in Pyongyang  in sessions that inaugurated a policy of reconciliation between the two cold war enemies, which remain technically at war. That meeting led to a profound change in relations between the two countries.

Former political prisoners are coming forward with accounts of witch hunts and torture that can sound unreal to young South Koreans today.

SEOUL,South Korea, March 9 — In his final days, the Venerable Bogwang, a fisherman turned Buddhist monk, wrestled with his conscience. The scriptures he revered exhorted him to leave behind the entanglements of the material world. But he could not shake off the nightmarish memories of the interrogation room of South Korea’s once-infamous Army Security Command, where, he said, he was held for 43 days and tortured in 1983. “They tied me naked in a steel chair and attached an electric cord to my genitals,” he said in his last interview. “When they threw the switch, electricity bolted through my spine and jolted my brain. It was as if my body jumped a meter off the floor.” By the time the military interrogators were done with him, he had signed a confession that said he was a Communist spy. He served 15 years, and during that time his wife, who had also been tortured, divorced him, and he never saw his children again. He was released in 1998 and  became a monk two years later. He joined scores of South Koreans fighting to clear their names of political subversion charges under the military dictatorships from the 1960s to the 80s. Under the auspices of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, established by the government of President Roh Moo-hyun at the end of 2005, investigations are under way. Verdicts are being reviewed and in some cases overturned. But on Feb. 25, the Venerable Bogwang died, apparently of natural causes, at his hillside monastery, 60 miles south of Seoul. His death, at 57, was a reminder of the painfully slow progress the Roh government is making in delving into the country’s tumultuous history, and what a political minefield the past remains in South Korea. In the interview nine days before his death, he spoke passionately about his campaign to establish the truth of what happened to him 24 years before, at a time when the military government often resorted to red scares to quash political opposition. “Senior monks say that I should forgive everything and leave it behind; they say hatred begets hatred,” he said. “But they also say I should seek truth. My mind is full of conflict. One thing I know is that I cannot leave behind the false charge that I was a Communist spy.” Former political prisoners are coming forward with accounts of witch hunts and torture that can sound unreal to young South Koreans today. Large-scale antigovernment demonstrations, tear gas and firebombs have long since receded from the streets.North Koreastirs more sympathy for its economic plight than it does fear. The Korea of three decades ago was a very different place. On Sept. 26, 1971, Lee Sang-chul — the man who would become the Venerable Bogwang — was a deckhand on a fishing boat that drifted into North Korean waters during a storm. It was seized by North Korean  patrol boats. The 21 crewmen were allowed to return home after 11 months, amid a budding easing of tensions. Beforehand, however, the North Korean authorities brought in Mr. Lee’s uncle, who had been reported missing during the 1950-53 Korean War. They warned Mr. Lee that a “bad thing” would happen to his uncle if he did not spy for them. Once back in the South, Mr. Lee underwent a 90-day debriefing and, according to the police, confessed that he had been trained to spy. The crewmen were tried and given suspended one-year sentences for entering Communist waters. The young Mr. Lee thought his troubles were over. But 12 years later, on Nov. 15, 1983, agents from the Army Security Command, a powerful intelligence outfit loyal to the military dictator Chun Doo-hwan, arrived at the shipyard where he was working and shoved him into a black sedan. The espionage activities of both North Korea and South Korea had diminished with the mid-1970s easing of tensions, but political persecution had not. In the South, anti-Communist squads from the police, the military and the main intelligence agency closely monitored Koreans living in Japan, relatives of South Koreans taken to the North during the war, relatives of the South Korean fishermen abducted after the war and never seen again — and those who, like Mr. Lee,  managed to return. The government saw them as potential threats, and, according to testimony and investigative reports by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, as a pool of scapegoats. “They asked me to draw a map of the shipyard,” the Venerable Bogwang recalled. “When I did, they said I got that information for spy purposes. They asked me where the police station was in my town and how many officers were there. When I answered, they said I collected that information for the North Koreans.” Interrogators deprived him of sleep for days, then made him sit in front of high-intensity lights, he said. They tied him to a rod like “a pig being roasted,” put a wet towel over his nose and eyes, and poured water laced with mustard or pepper into his mouth. Kim Byung-jin, 51, who was an interpreter for interrogators at the Army Security Command, called such methods of torture common. “They could make the victim say whatever they wanted him to say,” he said. “Truth was irrelevant.” Mr. Kim did not just see the torture. A Korean resident of Japan, he was studying at Yonsei University in Seoul in 1983 when he was brought in as a Communist suspect and tortured before being put on the military’s payroll for two years. “I still hear them saying to me, ‘You ready? Here we go!’ as they cranked up the generator to send electricity to the wire tied around my fingers,” Mr. Kim said in an interview last month. He said he admitted to “nonsensical charges” after they threatened to send his wife to a brothel and his infant son to an orphanage. In November, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission began releasing its reports, recommending that the courts retry several spy cases that it concluded were built on torture and fabricated evidence. The commission also recommended that the state formally apologize to those wrongly convicted. On Jan. 23, a court acquitted, posthumously, eight men who were hanged in 1975 on charges of organizing a “People’s Revolutionary Party,” ostensibly to overthrow the government at North Korea’s behest. The court found that the men were executed on the basis of confessions extracted under torture. But with a presidential election looming at the end of this year, the investigations are raising political hackles. Conservative critics call them a “score-settling” by leftists. “This is a political offensive against me,” Park Geun-hye, the daughter of Park Chung-hee, who ruled South Korea with an iron fist for 18 years until his assassination in 1979, told reporters in January. She hopes to run in the December election as a candidate of the conservative opposition. During the interview, the Venerable Bogwang recalled the day his interrogators brought in his daughter and son, aged 6 and 4, to weaken his resolve. “My daughter said, ‘Daddy, please come home,’ and kissed me,” he said. “That was 24 years ago, and the last time I saw them.”

A foreigner living in North Korea said that while tensions were high, life in the capital seemed normal, that is, difficult for most.

SEOUL, South Korea — WhileNorth Korea’s state-run media continued to rage over the military exercises being held off the North’s coastline, saying the four days of drills that ended Wednesday afternoon had brought the Korean Peninsula to “the brink of war,” much of daily life in the secretive North appeared remarkably normal, or at least what passes for normal. Accounts from the North reaching Seoul suggested that residents of Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, had been calmly discussing last week’s artillery duel withSouth Korea, foreigners living in the city were worrying about an escalation in tensions with the South and the nation’s leader was celebrated for his legendary contributions to “the brilliant tradition of Korean dancing art.” Information about the reclusive North Korean state is notoriously difficult to come by, but a proliferation of cellphones and computer links in recent years have pried the lid off to some extent. In the past several days, a foreigner was able to get out a detailed message describing conditions in Pyongyang based on personal observations and the reports of foreign aid workers in the city. Aid workers said their conversations with North Korean colleagues and clients suggested that the artillery battle was being seen as “business as usual, another incident of many that have been happening over many years,” said the foreigner, who requested anonymity for fear of angering the North Korean government. “Of course, people don’t know about the international response to the shelling, but it sounds like it feels like it’s ‘more of the same’ for these Koreans.” The foreigner said some expatriates working with charities and development agencies in the North had this response: “We have seen crises like this before, but we’re taking it very seriously. And this is the first time there have been civilian casualties, which ups the ante.” Meanwhile, apparently, life goes on, at least for Kim Jong-il, the “Dear Leader” of North Korea. Mr. Kim was the focus of a university symposium to mark the 20th anniversary of the publication of his celebrated book “The Theory of Dancing Art.” Mr. Kim’s work “clarifies the principled requirements and ways for carrying forward and developing the brilliant tradition of Korean dancing art established in the period of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle,” according to a report Tuesday from the North’s official news agency. Mr. Kim also toured a machine-tool factory and offered “field guidance” on how to improve production, the Korean Central News Agency said. Mr. Kim is heralded in the North, as was his father, for dispensing guidance on myriad trips to factories, farms, hospitals, military bases, film sets and sound stages. At the Ryongsong Machine Complex, the agency reported, Mr. Kim visited the factory dining hall where he expressed concern for the workers’ daily lives “as their real father would do.” He was accompanied by his sister, Kim Kyong-hee, and her husband, Jang Song-taek, both of whom are members of Mr. Kim’s ruling inner circle. No mention was made of his youngest son and apparent heir, Kim Jong-un. Pyongyang, of course, has by far the best living standards in the otherwise impoverished North, which is facing renewed famine,according to numerous reports.A recent visitor there said he had seen many people with cellphones, including three teenagers huddled over one phone as they were, yes, texting. Unlike on a previous visit, he said, he managed to slip away from his government escorts and went for a jog in the capital. He and his colleagues on an academic tour saw splashy displays of imported goods, especially cognac, and they were treated to lengthy and bountiful banquets. In a four-day visit, said the man, a Western scholar, there was only one brief power failure, and the huge statue of North Korea’s founding president, Kim Il-sung, remained lighted overnight in central Pyongyang. The North is chronically short of fuel and diesel oil, and many factories have been idled because of a lack of power and raw materials. A beer factory was operating, however, and the visitor pronounced the Taedong River beer, a local brand, “very drinkable.” Private stalls and markets in and around the capital “appeared to be thriving,” he added. After hearing complaints from factory managers and state economic planners, the scholar said any potential reform of the hyper-socialist economy in North Korea was being hamstrung by a range of sanctions by the United Nations, the United States and other nations. Most of the sanctions have been imposed over the North’s refusal to abandon its nuclear programs. The foreigner living in Pyongyang also saw the bark and the bite of sanctions among North Koreans. “Sanctions have not changed behaviors of the elite, nor have they stopped the flow of luxury goods or cars to Pyongyang,” the foreigner said. “But for ordinary people, they have so very little to work with — tools, running water, medicines in clinics. Imports of any kind are just absent.” The foreigner said political isolation had been effective in shutting off North Koreans to most international commerce, from material goods to cultural influences to political ideas. “In some ways,” the foreigner said, “people here are so used to being without — without stuff, without validation, without contact to the outside world, without a set of standards about how things happen — that sanctions and isolation are normal. They feed a sense of victimhood, or at least underdog-ness, that justifies both the regime and attacks like the one we’ve just seen. “That said, every day I wake up and I can’t believe that my ‘normal’ is living in a dictatorship. I feel a mixture of sadness and frustration at what I observe.”

SEOUL, South Korea — In aVeterans Dayspeech at a United States Army base in central Seoul,President Obamasaid Thursday that America remains committed to defendingSouth Korea, and warnedNorth Koreathat it faces continued isolation unless it fulfills its commitments to give upnuclear weapons. While Mr. Obama is in South Korea for a Group of 20 meeting on fixing the stricken global economy, relations with North Korea are also expected to be on the agenda, particularly in talks with the host nation. The United States and its allies are seeking ways to get North Korea to return to six-party talks aimed at convincing the North to drop its weapons program. Mr. Obama will meet later Thursday with the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, whose country’s relations with the North have become even more tense since the sinking in March of a South Korean warship, theCheonan, apparently by a North Korean torpedo. There are signs that there could be movement afoot as to the approach of the United States and its allies toward the reclusive regime of the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-il. Earlier this week, Mr. Lee dropped demands that the North apologize for the Cheonan’s sinking as a precondition of talks. In a strongly worded statement made before thousands of soldiers and Marines gathered on a chilly morning, Mr. Obama called North Korea a starving nation whose economic failures were visible even from space, where at night “the brilliant lights of Seoul” can be seen giving way “to the utter darkness of the North.” “But there is another path available to North Korea,” Mr. Obama said. “If they choose to fulfill their international obligations and commitments to the international community, they will have the chance to offer their people lives of growing opportunity instead of crushing poverty.” During the speech, Mr. Obama also honored the 37,000 Americans and far larger number of South Koreans who died fighting the North during the 1950-53 Korean War. He also led the audience in a standing ovation for 62 veterans of that war who attended the speech at the Yongsan base, in the center of this city of gleaming skyscrapers and modern highways. “Gentlemen, we are honored by your presence,” Mr. Obama said. “We are grateful for your service. And the world is better off because of what you did here.”

SEOUL, South Korea — Freighters carrying aid shipments of rice and instant noodles are being sent  toNorth Korea, the firstfood aidthe South Korean government has sent to the North since President Lee Myung-bak was elected here in early 2008. A freighter carrying 3 million cups of instant noodles left Inchon on Monday, and a ship with 5,000 tons of rice was to leave the port of Kunsan on Tuesday, according to an official of the Red Cross here, which is handling the delivery logistics. Both shipments were bound for Dandong, China, for trucking into North Korea. The food is part of an $8.5 million aid package that was agreed upon last month, when the countries also struck a deal to resume reunions between family members separated by the Korean War. The first of those reunions was to begin Saturday. Deliveries of cement and medicines are scheduled for December. Analysts saw the Monday shipments as the result of diplomatic overtures made by the North, prompted by new desperation over economic conditions — which have been made worse by a broad range of international sanctions. Parts of North Korea sufferedsevere floodingin August, but even under ideal conditions the nation of 25 million cannot feed itself. There are chronic and widely reported shortages of rice, sugar and cooking oil. The United NationsWorld Food Program saysthat one in three North Korean children under the age of 5 is malnourished, while more than 25 percent of the overall population needs food assistance. “The food aid is a small gift, and it’s purely humanitarian aid,” said Choi Jin-wook, a North Korea expert at theKorea Institute for National Unificationin Seoul. “What is important is not the amount, but that North Korea accepted it. “They keep knocking on the door of the United States andSouth Korea, and these shipments today have to be seen in the context of the North’s continuing efforts to make a breakthrough. It could be the starting point to a new chapter of inter-Korean relations.” Those relations have been badly frayed since thesinking of a South Korean warship in Marchand the loss of 46 sailors. Seoul has blamed a North Korean torpedo attack for the sinking of its corvette, theCheonan, and the conservative Lee government has demanded an apology as a precondition to any substantive diplomatic talks or rapprochement. The North has denied involvement in the sinking. Mr. Choi said that he believed the North was even trying to figure out how to “express regret about the sailors.” “It’s hard to say what exact wording would be acceptable as an apology,” he said. “But I think they’re working on it right now.” Some analysts and aid workers expressed concern that the rice shipped Monday — an amount the Red Cross estimated could feed about 325,000 people for a month — would be diverted to the political elite, loyal party members and the military. That has been the pattern, they said, of previous government aid deliveries. “I’m not unhappy about food going up, but I fear that this kind of government-to-government distribution to Pyongyang will be carried out along loyalty lines,” said Tim Peters, founder ofHelping Hands Korea, a Christian group focused on famine relief in North Korea and aid for North Koreans who defected to China. “Distribution through small NGOs that are more strategically placed and can get the food into the interior and places like remote mining towns, that is the more intelligent strategy.” Mr. Peters said his group had  received numerous reports from defectors that the hinterlands “never see any of this kind of food aid.” Five weeks ago, a truck convoy delivered 203 tons of rice to North Korea, the first rice donations of any kind from the South in nearly three years. That nongovernmental assistance, which was donated by charity groups and opposition political parties, came one day after a shipment of 530 tons of flour was sent by a South Korean provincial government and civic groups.

South Korea said it arrested a North Korean spy who posed as a defector with the aim of assassinating a former member of the North Korean regime.

SEOUL, South Korea — The South Korean authorities said Wednesday that they had arrested a North Korean spy who had been on a mission to assassinate the highest-ranking North Korean official ever to defect. The official, Hwang Jang-yop, 87, was found dead in his bathtub here 10 days ago. News reports said that the authorities had concluded that he had died a day earlier after suffering heart failure while bathing, and then inhaling water. He lived under 24-hour government security, but still locked himself in every day for safety, so his body was not found for half a day, the reports said. The news broke the dayNorth Koreawas celebrating the 65th anniversary of its ruling Workers’ Party with a vast military parade. The authorities have maintained that Mr. Hwang died of natural causes, and said there was no connection between the death and the arrest. Citing unidentified intelligence officials, several South Korean newspapers assembled details of the case that read like a John Le Carré thriller and revealed the North Koreans’ unrelenting pursuit of turncoats. Mr. Hwang, once a leading theoretician for North Korea’s Communist government, was largely responsible for developing its guiding philosophy of juche, or self-reliance. He had been a mentor to the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, but became a bitter and disillusioned critic. He spoke out strongly against the North Korean government, doing so in a speech in Washington earlier this year. He initially defected to China in 1997, leaving his family to the torments of North Korean security officials. His wife and one daughter are believed to have committed suicide. His son and another daughter, and his granddaughters, were reportedly sent to labor camps. Meanwhile, the Kim government’s powerful intelligence apparatus mobilized to reach across borders to kill him, the accounts said. The North has long been suspected of sending determined assassins after defectors. In 1997, three days after Mr. Hwang claimed asylum in China, a man who had defected 15 years earlier — the nephew of one of Mr. Kim’s favorite consorts — was shot in the head outside his apartment near Seoul. His defection had never been publicized, and he had changed his name and undergone plastic surgery to conceal his identity. The man accused of seeking to assassinate Mr. Hwang, Ri Dong-sam, 46, was described as an agent with North Korea’s premier intelligence organization, the Reconnaissance General Bureau, who had begun five years of espionage training in 1998. Some reports said he crossed the border into China in 2004, even as other assassins and hit squads were infiltrating the South. He reportedly spent five years in China before getting the order to kill Mr. Hwang. He made his way in December 2009 to either Thailand or Laos. In May, he was apparently preparing to enterSouth Koreawhen two other fake defectors hunting Mr. Hwang were arrested in Seoul. The two, majors in the North Korean Army, were convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison in July. Mr. Ri, the reports said, postponed his arrival in South Korea until August. Like all those who identify themselves as defectors from the North, he was sequestered and questioned by South Korean intelligence agents. He reportedly admitted that he had been an agent with North Korean intelligence’s notorious Office 35 — tasked with abduction and assassination — but said that he had fled after being accused of corruption. But investigators said they became suspicious when he gave confusing answers about his hometown. It was not clear, however, whether they held him in custody until he was charged late Tuesday. Mr. Hwang was buried with state honors in the Daejeon National Cemetery, and a former South Korean president, Kim Young-sam, served as the honorary chairman of the funeral committee.

HUNTSVILLE, Ontario (AP) — The leaders of the world’s eight top industrial democracies on Saturday condemnedNorth Koreaover its suspected sinking of a South Korean warship. The statement by the countries — the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan and Russia — was released at the end of a meeting in Canada and before a summit meeting of the Group of 20,  which includes countries with fast-growing economies, like China. On the March 30 sinking of the South Korean warshipCheonan, the leaders cited an independent report that found that the ship had been sunk by a North Korean torpedo. Their statement said, “We condemn in this context the attack which led to the sinking of the Cheonan.” Japanese officials said the Russians were the only ones in theGroup of 8to resist tougher language condemning North Korea. A Russian delegation official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that because Russia still did not consider the results of the commission to be final, condemning Pyongyang further could lead to negative consequences.

SEOUL — As if they did not have enough things to disagree about, North Korea and South Korea have found one more: World Cup soccer. A South Korean television network has accused North Korea of illegally showing matches from South Africa to its isolated populace. North Korea’s state-run Central Television has shown replays of four World Cup games, including the opening match between South Africa and Mexico, and a Saturday match in which South Korea defeated Greece, 2-0. The replay of the South Korea-Greece game was shown Monday evening, with occasionally favorable commentary on the skills of South Korean players. The South Korean television network SBS said that it had acquired the sole rights from the World Cup organizer, FIFA, to broadcast the games throughout the Korean Peninsula and that it was investigating whether North Korea had pirated its signals. North Korea’s taped replays did not carry the audio or graphics from the original footage, making it difficult to tell  where the transmission originated. North Korea’s soccer team qualified for the World Cup this year for the first time since 1966, when it reached the quarterfinals. It was to play its first game Tuesday, against Brazil in Johannesburg. South Korea placed fourth in the 2002 World Cup, for which it and Japan were co-hosts. North Korea’s coach, Kim Jong-hun, said in a news conference Monday at Ellis Park stadium in Johannesburg that his team’s opening match would be shown in his country. But he did not clarify whether it would be shown live. North Korea illegally used some South Korean coverage of the 2002 World Cup, but in 2006 it made an arrangement to obtain television coverage legally from a South Korean network. SBS, the broadcaster, said it had been negotiating with North Korea on picking up the signals, but the talks fell through amid mounting tension over the March 26 sinking of a South Korean warship. A multinational investigation concluded that a North Korean torpedo had sunk the ship, killing 46 South Korean soldiers. The sinking has chilled the relationship between the two countries to its lowest point in years. Even if North Korea has pirated SBS transmissions of World Cup games, there is really no way for the South to punish the North, because since the ship sinking, the two countries have severed almost all official ties. In general, South Koreans think that exposing the isolated North to international sports events will help the country open up. Years ago, the South broadcast such events across the border as part of its propaganda campaign against the North. The North Korean coach went immediately on the defensive when asked about his team on the eve of its opening World Cup match against the five-time champion Brazil, The Associated Press reported from Johannesburg. After replying to the opening question about injuries — “Nobody is injured. They’re all in top shape,” Kim said — he bristled Monday at a follow-up from a South Korean reporter, speaking in Korean, who referred to his country as North Korea rather than the nation’s official title: the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. “There’s such no country called North Korea,” he said testily. “Next question.” Although commonly called North Korea abroad, the reclusive Communist nation refers to itself as the D.P.R.K. in English or Chosun in Korean, the precolonial name of the Korean Peninsula. FIFA refers to North Korea as  D.P.R. Korea, while it lists South Korea as Korea Republic. Kim also was asked whether the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, had a say in the selection of players. A FIFA media official cut the reporter off, reminding journalists not to ask political questions. The North Korean coach has shown his impatience with the media in the past, notably last year in Seoul, when he abruptly stalked out of a post-match news conference after accusing South Korean officials of deliberately poisoning his players. On Monday, a FIFA media official, Gordon Watson, contradicted reports that the North Korean squad had been overly secluded in South Africa, saying that North Korea had fulfilled all its mandatory media obligations and describing the team as being “very cooperative.”

WASHINGTON — North andSouth Koreaaccelerated their diplomatic confrontation on Tuesday over the recent sinking of a South Korean warship, with the South saying it would redesignate the North its “archenemy” andNorth Koreasevering almost all of its remaining ties to its far wealthier neighbor. American officials were cautious in their public statements, eager to avoid giving the North reason for further escalation. Military officials said no additional American combat forces, warships or aircraft had moved into the region — a standard practice in many past crises, including one in 2003. Officials watching activity on the ground through satellite photographs said there was no “unusual” activity at North Korea’s main nuclear test site. Both South Korea and the United States have blamed North Korea for the sinking of the ship, which they say was hit by a torpedo. The biggest concern within the Obama administration is that the diplomatic skirmishing between the North and South that has followed could spill, by design or accident, into an armed confrontation. The confrontation already appears to be the closest the two countries have come to open hostilities since 1994, when the North threatened to turn Seoul into a “sea of fire” if its nuclear violations were referred to the United Nations for sanctions. South Korea and the United States have said they will bring the issue of the sinking, which killed 46 sailors, to the Security Council for unspecified action. Whether significant new sanctions are applied depends on China’s leaders, who were conspicuously silent about tough measures against the North during Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton’s visit to Beijing this week. So far China has said nothing about the evidence that North Korea was responsible for the sinking; that evidence was collected by South Korea  and vetted by inspectors from several other countries. The designation of “archenemy,” announced by President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea, formalized the obvious, but it was a complete break from the “sunshine policy” of his two predecessors, Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun. “In the past 10 years, we have failed to establish the concept of principal enemy,” Mr. Lee told a meeting of senior advisers on Tuesday. “We have ignored the very danger under our feet.” The North responded by saying it would terminate all communications with the South while Mr. Lee, a conservative, was in office, and stop the South’s jets from using its airspace. But both countries let their biggest venture, the joint Kaesong industrial park, remain open, though its operations are expected to be crippled. Neither country seemed to take the final step, at least yet, of dismantling the last sign of progress they made in improving relations over the past decade, or losing the tens of thousands of jobs the industrial park creates. On Wednesday, the North Korean military threatened to "completely block South Korean personnel and vehicles" from Kaesong if the South resumes its psychological warfare. But the South Korean government said that the North had used a military tie line to approve the entry of hundreds of workers from the South to work their regular shifts at the industrial complex. And  the North, continuing its sharp language, warned that it would attack and destroy the propaganda loudspeakers to be put up along the border by the South, calling them a "military provocation." While there is a numbing amount of ritual threats and counterthreats involved in any crisis with North Korea, there are several big differences between the current one and other confrontations over the past 20 years. This one takes place  as North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-il, tries to build up the military credentials of one of his sons to extend the family dynasty in the country to a third generation. That succession plan, which remains murky even for American intelligence agencies, could change the dynamic, and give Mr. Kim an interest in escalating the confrontation. This is also the first crisis since North Korea conducted two nuclear tests — one in 2006, another just months after President Obama was inaugurated in 2009. The North is now believed to have fuel for at least eight weapons, and that may give the country’s military leadership greater confidence that the United States and South Korea will not risk military retaliation, even if the confrontation escalates. “We don’t think this is over, and there are plenty of reasons to believe that this is just an opening salvo by Kim Jong-il,” one senior American official said. Thomas Hubbard, the American ambassador in Seoul during the 2003 nuclear crisis, when the North threw out international inspectors and began harvesting the nuclear fuel, said: “This is a profoundly different kind of attack on South Korea than we’ve seen in recent times. It is a military attack on a military target — a violation of the armistice — rather than an act of terrorism.” And North Korea’s growing nuclear capacity “may explain why they felt emboldened to carry out an attack as brazen as this,” he said. In that regard, it poses a challenge to the Obama administration, just as Mr. Obama is staking much of his legacy on convincing countries thatnuclear weaponsconstrain their options, rather than making them more powerful. Mr. Kim clearly subscribes to a different theory. One early lesson that may emerge from the West’s cautious response to the sinking of the South’s ship may well be that he calculated correctly that what he calls his “nuclear deterrent” could help keep him, and his family, in power. Even before the North made real progress on its nuclear program, however, the South was hesitant to respond too strongly to Pyongyang’s provocations for fear it could ravage Seoul with conventional weapons. So far the Obama administration has portrayed itself as willing to let South Korea take the lead, befitting its role as one of the world’s largest economies. In truth, South Korean and American policy makers appear in near-hourly contact, and Mrs. Clinton traveled to Seoul on Wednesday. “Right now our strategy is being driven by alliance considerations and domestic politics,” said Joel Wit, who worked on North Korean issues for several previous administrations, co-authored a study of the 1994 crisis and now runs a Web site called “38North” on Korean issues. “We’ve ceded the initiatives to the North Koreans,” he said. IfKim Jong-ilis seeking to bolster the credentials of his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, it could explain reports in Seoul that Mr. Kim ordered his military and reserve forces to be ready for war, an organization of North Korean defectors said on Tuesday. Last Thursday, when the South formally accused the North of torpedoing its ship, a senior North Korean general relayed Mr. Kim’s order through a broadcast to intercoms fitted in most North Korean homes, said North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity, a Web site based in Seoul and run by North Korean defectors with contacts in the North. The reports of the alert status helped cause the main stock index in Seoul to drop more than three percentage points in early trading. The South Korean currency also weakened sharply. On Monday evening, South Korea resumed its “Voice of Freedom” radio broadcasts directed at the North Korean people. It boasted of the South’s economic prosperity and belittled the North Korean government for failing to feed its people.

South Korea’s military intelligence warned of a possible attack from small manned submarines months before a South Korean warship sank in a mysterious explosion.

SEOUL, South Korea —South Korea’s military intelligence warned the country’s navy of a possible human torpedo attack fromNorth Koreamonths before a South Korean warship sank in a mysterious explosion in late March, a newspaper report said Thursday. South Korea has not yet blamed North Korea for the March 26 sinking of the 1,200-ton warship, the Cheonan. But it has said the ship was torn in half in an “external” blast, fueling  suspicions that it was hit by a North Korean torpedo. North Korea has denied involvement. Early this year, the South Korean Defense Intelligence Command had alerted the navy to “possible attacks of North Korean human torpedoes,” the mass-circulation Chosun Ilbo reported on Thursday, citing an unnamed government source. So-called human torpedoes are in fact small submarines. Pilots steer them toward a target, release the submarine’s warhead and ride the craft away, often killing themselves in the process. The command also warned that the North Koreans were vowing retaliation for a naval skirmish last November. That battle was considered a South Korean victory because no Southern sailors died while a North Korean ship was heavily damaged with an uncertain number of causalities. The Defense Ministy in Seoul refused to comment on the Chosun report, citing its policy of not commenting on intelligence matters. The human torpedoes were developed by the Japanese military and, along with kamikaze air attacks, were employed in the last, desperate stages of World War II to overcome the allies’ increasingly effective defenses. Historians say that almost as many Japanese died in the attacks as the 162 American seamen and officers who went down in the two recorded sinkings in human torpedo attacks. In an era of laser-guided weaponry, the notion of a human torpedo is obviously anachronistic and indicative of the general decrepitude of the North Korean military. Making a virtue of necessity, however, North Korea often exhorts its people and soldiers to become “human rifles and bombs.” The Cheonan sank in waters near the disputed western sea border between the two Koreas, the site of skirmishes in 1999 and 2002. On Thursday, another sailor was found dead, bringing the number of confirmed dead among Cheonan sailors to 39. Seven remain missing. South Korea is investigating the wreck of the rear half of the Cheonan, which was lifted out of the water last week. Engineers are expected to salvage the other half this weekend. Investigators are also scouring the sea bottom to collect debris from the explosion, which they hope will provide clues to what and who caused the blast. The Chosun report cited its source as saying that South Korea had detected signs of North Korea’s training a human torpedo unit. Military auditors were investigating whether the navy had ignored the warning, the report said. Chosun also releaseda videoon Thursday that, if authentic, would provide the first visual corroboration of the North Korean government’s recent crackdown on private markets. The video shows a busy outdoor market in Onsong, the northernmost city in North Korea, in October and the same market, all but deserted, four and a half months later.  “It only shows one market at two points in time,” said Kay Seok, a Human Rights Watch researcher based in Seoul who monitors North Korea, after watching the video. “But it visually conforms with what we have been reading and hearing from various sources about what has been going on in markets inside North Korea.” After years of tolerating private markets, North Korea began cracking down on them in late November, reasserting state controls over the economy withdisastrous results. Inflation and food shortages followed. South Korean news media reported sporadic but highly unusual outbursts of public discontent in the North. The authorities then relaxed some controls. But traders did not return to the markets, instead hoarding their goods, according to analysts who monitor the North Korean economy. The newspaper said its journalists worked with the Rev. Kim Seung-eun, head of Caleb Mission, a shelter for North Korean refugees in the South, who also sends aid into the North. The journalists and Mr. Kim sent five pen-shaped video cameras into the North with North Koreans working for the pastor. After the videos were made, Mr. Kim collected the cameras at the Chinese-North Korean border.

North Korea on Wednesday acknowledged an outbreak of swine flu, which South Korea had said killed dozens of people in the reclusive country.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreaacknowledged nine cases ofswine fluon Wednesday, but relief officials inSouth Koreareported that dozens of North Koreans had died of the flu. North Korea’s official news agency, K.C.N.A., said the nine cases had been confirmed in the capital of Pyongyang and in Sinuiju, a town near the border with China. It did not say whether there had been any deaths. However, the aid groupGood Friends, which isbased in Seoulbut gleans information on North Korea through inside informants, said about 40 people had died in the last month after the H1N1 strain caused a flu outbreak in the North. The South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, offered Tuesday to send flu medication to North Korea. The North, which regards him as a traitor for his stance against itsnuclear weaponsprogram, has not responded. North Korean health officials were stepping up “the quarantine system against the spread of this flu virus while properly carrying on the prevention and medical treatment,” K.C.N.A. said. Good Friends also said that the North Korean government was strengthening customs inspections on the border with China in what seemed to be an attempt to contain the virus. The group also said the authorities were instructing schools to start a winter vacation earlier than usual. North Korea, which is tightly controlled by the government of the reclusive leader Kim Jong-il, rarely acknowledges its domestic problems to the outside world. It suffered a deadly famine in the 1990s, and has been accepting help from South Korean and other outside relief agencies.

SEOUL,South Korea—North Koreaagreed to hold talks with South Korea later this week on nonmilitary matters, officials said here Tuesday, a day after the Northtested short-range missilesoff its eastern coast. Officials from the two Koreas plan to meet Wednesday at a North Korean border city to discuss how to prevent floods in the Imjin River, which runs through their heavily armed border, the Unification Ministry in Seoul reported. Six South Koreans were killedlast month when North Korea released water from a dam upriver without notice, causing a flash flood. The North said the emergency release of water was necessary because rain and floodwaters had threatened to breach the dam. Afterward, the Southdemanded an apologyin addition to talks to prevent such episodes. Separately, the Red Cross societies from both sides were set to meet Friday to discuss reunions of families separated by the Korean War. Two weeks ago, they organized a round of family reunions for the first time in two years, furthering the prospects of reconciliation between North and South Korea, whose relations had chilled over the North’s nuclear and missile tests this year. In the past, South Korea shippedfood aidas a humanitarian gesture after such family reunions. North Korea is expected to seek food shipments during the new round of Red Cross talks this week while South Korea demands regular family reunions. “The talks will become a turning point in inter-Korean relations,” said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. “In that sense, the North’s missile tests are significant in their timing.” Still, the test-firings on Monday were the first in three months and were seen as both a provocation and a puzzle — an ominous reminder of the North’s military muscle but also confounding because it had been trying to get Washington to start bilateral talks. “North Korea is blowing hot and cold, taking both conciliatory and hard-line gestures to force its opponents to decide,” Mr. Yang said. “The North sees the United States dither in starting bilateral talks with it, so by launching and preparing missiles, it is offering a reminder of why it needed to be engaged.”

PresidentLee Myung-bakofSouth Koreacalled Saturday for talks withNorth Koreaaimed at ridding the Korean peninsula ofnuclear weapons, as well as making cuts in conventional weapons. “Nuclear weapons do not guarantee North Korea’s security, they only cloud its future,” President Lee said in a speech to commemorate Korea’s 1945 liberation from Japanese rule. It was the first time that the president, who leads a conservative government, had publicly called for cuts in conventional arms, analysts here said. More than 600,000 South Korean soldiers, supported by 28,500 United States troops, are deployed on the Korean peninsula, confronting a potential threat from the North’s military of 1.1 million troops.

A South Korean court has for the first time accepted an inheritance case brought by North Koreans trying to establish property rights in the South.

SEOUL,South Korea— A South Korean court has for the first time accepted a lawsuit brought by North Korean citizens trying to establish their rights to property in the South. Legal experts say it is a harbinger of what reunification might bring and are urging a study of what policies and legislation should govern North-South civil disputes. Four North Korean brothers and sisters have sued their late father’s second wife and that couple’s four children in South Korea for a share of an inheritance from the estate of the father, a  doctor. The suit claims at least a quarter of the father’s land and other property, worth about $8 million. He leftNorth Koreafor the South with his eldest daughter during the 1950-53 Korean War and never returned. In 1959, he reported that his first wife had died.  He  married a South Korean woman, with whom he had four more children. He died in 1987. Family members in the South, including the sister who came here with the father, asked that only the family name, Yoon, be used, to protect the relatives in the North and the privacy of those in the South. The lawsuit was initiated last year by the eldest daughter, who still lives in the South. The lawyer handling the suit is Bae Geum-ja, who was involved in a similar case in 2001 that was settled out of court. In January, legal documents, accompanied by fingernail and hair clippings from the North Korean plaintiffs, were accepted by Seoul Central District Court. “The next step is to apply for a DNA test to confirm lineage,” Ms. Bae said. While this is the first time a South Korean court has accepted a suit filed by North Koreans, the right of North Koreans to sue in the South has already been established by Supreme Court rulings and the Constitution. Because theSouth Korean Constitutiondefines the Republic of Korea as the entire peninsula and surrounding islets, North Koreans have citizenship rights in the South. In 2001 and again in 2005, civil suits by North Koreans were settled before they were accepted for trial. Should the plaintiffs win, it is difficult to predict whether they would actually benefit. Private property and inheritance rights hardly exist under North Korea’s tightly controlled Communist system, and travel to the South is highly restricted. Relations between the Koreas are at a low. The South, which spent years trying to engage the North’s isolated dictatorship, is pursuing a  harder line now, particularly after the North’s second nuclear test. But communications grew considerably under the so-called Sunshine Policy, bringing a broader concern here of a possible explosion of such lawsuits. About eight million people — 17 percent of South Korea’s population — left behind first spouses and other family members in North Korea, according to the Committee of the Five Provinces of North Korea, an organization of former North Korean residents who track individuals with separated families. “If the plaintiffs prevail in this case, every North Korean with a relative in South Korea will claim an inheritance,” said one of the South Korean Yoons in an interview with theSeoul Broadcasting System.

North Koreans rallied in Pyongyang on Thursday, according to state media, as the regime threatened a “fire shower of nuclear retaliation” against the United States and its ally South Korea.

SEOUL,South Korea— About 100,000 North Koreans rallied and marched in the capital on Thursday, the Communist state’s official media reported, as the government threatened a “fire shower of nuclear retaliation” against the United States and its ally South Korea. North Koreaalso commemorated the anniversary of theoutbreak of the Korean War in 1950with a state-mobilized display of anti-American fervor in Pyongyang, the capital. It was the first time in three years that North Korea had commemorated the anniversary with a huge outdoor rally. The crowd brimmed with anti-American slogans and speeches, denouncing the international sanctions the United Nationsrecently imposedon the North after its May 25 nuclear test. A large poster hung at the rally showed a rifle with an affixed bayonet over a hill covered with graves and admonished, “If you attack, only death will await you.” Such harsh statements are a hallmark of North Korean rhetoric against the United States and its allies, which the North regularly threatens with a “nuclear holocaust.” But its tone has recently grown more strident. “Our revolutionary armed forces will deal an annihilating blow that is unpredictable and unavoidable, to any ‘sanctions’ or provocations by the U.S.,” a speaker told the crowd, according to theKorean Central News Agency, the North’s state-run news service. North Korean media said the North would never give up its “nuclear deterrent” but instead would strengthen it because of what the media called an American plot to invade the North. Rodong Sinmun, the North’s main newspaper, said that the United States’ recent pledge to defend South Korea was tantamount to “asking for the calamitous situation of having a fire shower of nuclear retaliation all over South Korea.” International sanctions could further isolate the already impoverished North. But the government appears to be using them to stoke anti-American anger and consolidate its power at home at a time when the North’s leader, Kim Jong-il, is seeking to bequeath his power to one of his sons, according to officials and private analysts in South Korea. Mr. Kim, 67, reportedly had a stroke last August.

Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said that the United States had detected no unusual military movement in North Korea, and had no plans to reinforce American forces in South Korea.

ANDERSEN AIR FORCE BASE, Guam — Defense SecretaryRobert M. Gatessaid Friday that the United States had detected no unusual military movement inNorth Koreaand had no plans to reinforce some 28,000 American forces inSouth Koreaafter North Korea threatened is neighbor to the South with a military attack. “I’m not aware of any military moves in the North that are out of the ordinary at least,” Mr. Gates told reporters on his plane en route to Singapore for an annual security conference that will be dominated by North Korea’s test this week of a nuclear device. The defense secretary said that he saw no need to bolster American troops in South Korea, and that “should the North Koreans do something rash and extremely provocative militarily,” the United States “has the forces to deal with it.” Mr. Gates said he will use the previously scheduled conference to reassure America’s strongest allies in northeast Asia, Japan and South Korea of President Obama’s commitment to their defense in the face of the latest of a half-century of threats from North Korea. The North tested a nuclear device and launched three missiles in defiance of international sanctions on Monday, fired three more missiles on Tuesday and threatened military strikes against South Korea on Wednesday. By Thursday, the South Korean and American militaries had raised their alert level on North Korea to the second highest, invoked when “a grave threat” is feared from the North. But Mr. Gates said the Obama administration considered the test aggressive but not a crisis. Nonetheless, he echoed other senior officials by saying that North Korea’s export of its nuclear technology to other countries was a major concern. “These guys have shown a penchant in the past for selling anything they’ve been able to develop,” Mr. Gates said. North Korea’s military threats on Wednesday against the South, which were more belligerent than usual, were in response to South Korea’s decision on Tuesday to join an American-led operation to stop and search ships carrying suspicious cargo. The operation, called the Proliferation Security Initiative, was created by President George W. Bush in 2003 and now includes 95 countries. North Korea reacted by calling South Korea’s action a “declaration of war.” North Korea’s nuclear test on Monday, an underground blast in the mountains of Kilju near the Chinese border, was the country’s second nuclear test. So far, American officials believe it to be more of a successful explosion than North Korea’s first nuclear test, conducted in 2006 in the same spot and later judged only partially successful. In Singapore, Mr. Gates is to attend the annual Shangri-la Dialogue, a regional defense conference organized by the International Institute for Strategic Studies and named for the luxury hotel in which it is held. While there, Mr. Gates is to meet with the highest-ranking defense official sent by China, the deputy chief of staff of the general staff for the People’s Liberation Army, Lieut. Gen. Ma Xiaotian, and is likely to push China to follow up strong condemnations of North Korea’s test with action. Mr. Gates said that China, which has some influence on North Korea, could help by strongly supporting strengthened sanctions against North Korea that the United States is now pushing in the United Nations Security Council. The sanctions could include banning imports and exports of all arms — only heavy weapons are restricted now — and cutting off North Korea’s access to international banks. In Singapore, Mr. Gates will also meet with the defense ministers of Japan and South Korea. He is to be joined by James Steinberg, the deputy secretary of state, and Dennis Blair, the director of national intelligence. Mr. Gates also told reporters that six-party talks between the United States, North Korea and other countries in the region had not worked so far. “They clearly have not had the impact in North Korea that any of us have wanted,” Mr. Gates said. “That doesn’t mean they’re useless, by any means, and we are still committed to the six-party talks.”

SEOUL,South Korea—  South Korea bolstered its military readiness and scrambled to figure outNorth Korea’s intentions on Friday, after the North declared that it was scrapping the agreements both countries had signed to ease military and political tensions on the divided peninsula. North Korea’s decision followed a recent series of sharp comments and aggressive gestures that officials and analysts in Seoul said were aimed at gaining the attention of the new American administration and concessions from President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea. “Relations between the North and South have worsened to the point where there is no way or hope of correcting them,” said a statement on Friday from the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea, the North Korean agency in charge of relations with the South.  A South Korean Navy destroyer has sailed into waters near the disputed western sea border with North Korea —  the scene of naval skirmishes in 1999 and 2002  — to bolster defenses there, the national South Korean news agency Yonhap reported Friday, without citing sources. “What we can say is that we are beefing up our readiness,” a South Korean military spokesman, who spoke on the customary condition of anonymity, said while declining to confirm the Yonhap report. Since the 1970s the two Koreas have signed a series of agreements for nonaggression, which the North’s government has flouted repeatedly, rendering the pacts little more than symbolic. Still, this was the first time that North Korea said that it was officially nullifying them. Mr. Lee, the South Korean president, who has largely ignored the recent North Korean threats, urged the North to reopen dialogue. “Of all the countries in the world, who cares the most sincerely about North Korea? The United States? Japan? China? Russia?” said Mr. Lee in a live television round-table discussion. “North Korea must realize that it’s South Korea.” Mr. Lee predicted that dialogue with North Korea would resume “before long.” But some analysts said that the chances of North Korea possibly starting a limited border skirmish to prove its points were rising. North Korea’s hostility toward the South has increased since Mr. Lee took office in Seoul a year ago. He vowed to take a tougher stance on North Korea, a position that effectively reversed 10 years of his liberal predecessors’ efforts to engage the North. Two weeks ago, the North Korean military declared an “all-out confrontational posture” toward the South. Officials in Pyongyang also told a visiting American scholar that it had “weaponized” enough plutonium for four or five nuclear bombs. Won Tae-jae, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense in Seoul, said Friday that the South would respond “resolutely” if the North violated its western sea border. “We will see more tension in western waters,” said Lee Byong-chul, a senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation, a policy advisory body in Seoul. “It doesn’t appear that it will just end up as empty words from the North.” He predicted that North Korea would focus on improving ties with the Obama administration, while snubbing the South Korean president.

The new, conservative South Korean government warned that it would not expand economic ties unless the North abandoned its nuclear weapons programs.

SEOUL,South Korea— The new, conservative South Korean government took a tougher line onNorth Koreaon Wednesday, warning that it would speak out against human rights abuses in the Communist North and that it would not expand economic ties unless the North abandoned its nuclear weapons programs. North Korea angrily reacted on Thursday by expelling 11 South Korean officials based in a joint industrial complex in the North Korean border town of Kaesong. The new South Korean policy, outlined by the new president,Lee Myung-bak, means at least a temporary reduction in generous South Korean economic aid at a dire time for the North, with cuts in humanitarian  aid expected to follow. In recent weeks, relief experts have warned that food shortages in the North will worsen because of high global commodity prices, flood damage and aid donors’ reluctance in light of the country’s nuclear wrangling with the United States. “The speed and scope of, as well as ways to push for any development in, inter-Korean relations will be decided according to progress in the North Korean nuclear issue,” Unification Minister Kim Ha-joong, the South’s major policy maker on the North, said during a briefing. Mr. Kim said Seoul would not push for any joint economic programs with the North, absent progress in the nuclear disarmament talks. He also vowed to emphasize the issue of the return of South Korean citizens kidnapped by the North during and after the Korean War, which previous governments have largely skirted. Hours after South Korea announced its firmer policy, North Korea expelled the  11 South Koreans in Kaesong. The Kaesong complex, where the South Korean companies run shoe and other factories with North Korean labor, has symbolized the earlier Seoul governments’ “sunshine policy” of using economic projects to encourage the North to open up and embrace a market economy. The  South Korean officials had been stationed there to help run the complex. Operations at the Kaesong factories were not immediately affected. Mr. Lee, who took office last month, has accused his predecessors of making too many concessions to the North in the name of reconciliation and has vowed not to shy away from criticizing the North on human rights. “I love North Korean people more than anybody else, and I believe the North Korean people should get to a point where they can enjoy the minimum basic happiness of human beings,” Mr. Lee said Wednesday. Some analysts said Mr. Lee risked alienating North Korea. Although the North is dependent on aid, which has increased under the liberal South Korean governments of the past 10 years, it has in the past refused aid that was not given on its own terms. The new policy also slows a bold economic effort by South Korea over the past decade to build South Korean factories in North Korea, where the companies that own them can use the cheap labor there to compete better with China. South Korea on Wednesday confirmed reports that it would vote this week for a United Nations Human Rights Council resolution criticizing North Korea as an abuser of human rights and seeking an extended United Nations investigation. That decision is also a change from the policies of the previous  governments. Under the liberal governments of Mr. Lee’s predecessors,Roh Moo-hyunand Kim Dae-jung, Seoul was reluctant to criticize the North publicly out of concern that doing so might hurt ties and efforts to resolve the international standoff over the North’s nuclear program. This week, the South’s National Human Rights Commission said for the first time that it would investigate human rights abuses in North Korea. Previously, the commission focused almost exclusively on issues within South Korea’s borders.

Known as the “enemy cemetery” in South Korea, it contains the remains of communist fighters or infiltrators North Korea has not reclaimed.
==::==

==::==
PAJU,South Korea— The hillside cemetery here is unlike any other in South Korea. The graves, arranged in neat rows, have no headstones. Instead they have identical three-foot-tall, white wooden stakes, most of them reading  “Anonymous” and revealing little else about who lies beneath. In contrast to the Korean tradition of aligning graves toward the south, these face north, looking homeward. Decades after they fell in combat during the Korean War, from 1950 to 1953, or in postwar espionage missions, the Communist warriors buried here still await a trip home. Their remains are unclaimed by their government, which has refused to negotiate for those of the veterans and, in the case of armed infiltrators, denies their existence. “We don’t come to this place,” said Choi Jae-hyun, a 73-year-old farmer who lives near the cemetery. “We still resentNorth Korea. We find this place uncomfortable to visit.” What is familiarly known here as the “enemy cemetery,” just south of the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea, opened in 1996 as a burial ground for the remains of 96 North Koreans and Chinese whose bodies were once buried in plots scattered throughout the South. Since South Korea began systematically excavating the war’s major battle sites in 2000, the number of bodies has grown to 391. The cemetery’s original intent was to serve as a way station for remains that would one day be repatriated. But the politics of a war that  never officially ended  left them stranded here, a tucked-away monument to unresolved cold war hostilities on the divided Korean Peninsula. “The cemetery and I are witnesses to the North Korean plot to overthrow the South Korean government,” a former North Korean commando, Kim Shin-jo, said recently. “The North can’t accept the remains because if it does, it has to admit the plot and apologize.” On Jan. 21, 1968, Mr. Kim and 30 other North Korean infiltrators penetrated the heavily guarded border, he said, breaching a section staffed by American troops, and came within striking distance of President Park Chung-hee’s residence in Seoul before they were repelled. Twenty-nine of them either were gunned down or killed themselves in battles near the presidential palace, or in the hills and frozen streams around their present burial site while beating a desperate retreat north. One commando is believed to have reached North Korea. Thirty-four South Koreans were killed. Mr. Kim was the only one captured alive. “I’ve come to cut Park Chung-hee’s throat,” he said at a news conference then. Later pardoned by the South Korean government, Mr. Kim, 67, has reinvented himself as a Christian pastor and fiery crusader against Communism, railing against the North Korean government in lectures at military installations, churches and schools. For that, defectors have told him, his family in the North has paid a heavy price: his parents were executed and his brothers have disappeared. Many of the wooden markers for Mr. Kim’s former comrades carry their names and ranks, and read, “Killed in the Jan. 21 incident.” But other markers say “Unidentified armed Communist commando,” or just note where the remains were found. Buried behind Mr. Kim’s colleagues are six North Koreans killed in 1998, when their spy boat was sunk by South Korea’s navy off the South’s southern coast.  Traces of poison were found in some of the bodies, suggesting  they killed themselves when they realized their mission had failed. Also interred here is a North Korean who planted a bomb on a South Korean jetliner that exploded over Myanmar in 1987 with 115 people aboard. He swallowed poison before he was caught. A woman later confessed to being an accomplice. Most of  the graves in this cemetery, carved into a hill in Paju, a  county north of Seoul, belong to North Korean soldiers killed in the war. Before this cemetery opened, when South Korean soldiers killed infiltrators or found Communist war dead, they buried them under  weeds and left them unattended. Soldiers and police detectives would then monitor the sites for any mourners who might betray their loyalties. The cemetery was established after the United States opened negotiations with North Korea in the early 1990s about bringing back the remains of American soldiers killed in the Korean War. The hope was that similar talks might take place between North and South Korea. That has not happened. Although North Korea has been eager to recover American war dead for large cash rewards from Washington, it refuses to accept the remains of its own war veterans from the South. It wants to sign a peace treaty with the United States to end the war officially but also wants the South kept out of that process. As to later infiltrators, the South has offered to repatriate their remains, but the North does not acknowledge sending them. Further complicating the issue, the South denies sending any commandos into the North, although thousands are thought to have disappeared there. Caught in this inter-Korean deadlock, the remains of Chinese who fought the war on the North Korean side are also marooned here. In recent years, as a thaw has set in between North and South, the dead have  received better treatment. South Korean soldiers greet new arrivals with a modest ceremony and trim the weeds.  The name has been changed to the “Cemetery for North Korean and Chinese Soldiers,” more neutral than the old “Cemetery for North Korean Puppet and Chinese Communist Soldiers.” In the hills nearby, South Korean troops still keep artillery trained on the North. But on a highway not far from here, cargo trucks and tourist buses breach the border every day. Recently, the cemetery lay peacefully under a cloudless sky. A mouse nibbled at a grave marker, looked around and retreated under a bush. Down the hill were rice paddies where migrant birds rested on their  journey north. Korean tradition says the ghost of a dead man wanders until he is buried in his hometown, in a grave  his family tends lovingly. “It’s a pity that these men, even dead, can’t go home,” said Kwak Ho-yoon, 70, a  farmer. “If alive, they would be older than I am. I hope they will return home while there are still relatives left who remember them.”

It took Lee Chan almost half of his life to make it from North Korea to South Korea, but it took only a few months of living on the periphery of Seoul to change him.

==::==
INCHEON,South Korea WHEN the elevator reached the 17th floor, the doors opened to reveal Lee Chan waiting in the hallway, looking far older than he had last fall, his face creased and sunburned, his entire body, it seemed, shrunken. Back then, he had emerged as the unofficial leader of dozens of North Korean refugees held at theimmigrationdetention center in Bangkok, Thailand. Standing with attitude in a visitation pen filled with detainees from all over Southeast Asia, openly smoking cigarettes he had somehow managed to get, speaking in a cocksure manner, he seemed a natural-born leader. He loomed large. Despite the hardships he had endured in the North and during his escape through China, he also looked younger than a man in his late 30s. But the months since his arrival in South Korea last December had changed him.  He now lived in a place he had never imagined occupying, one of the new, nondescript towns on the periphery of Seoul, dotted with identical white-and-blue high rises. “I’ve lost a lot of weight — it’s the stress from living in South Korea,” Mr. Lee said, shifting uneasily inside his own apartment, which he had furnished sparsely with part of the resettlement money the South Korean government gave to each North Korean arrival. It was a quiet, sunny Sunday — his one day off from the water-purifying company where he had recently started working — but worries were ruffling him. He had to pay off the $3,400 he owed the brokers who had smuggled him across China and through the Golden Triangle into Thailand. He had to find a way to bring over his 62-year-old mother, who is in hiding in northeast China. He had recently broken up with his girlfriend, a North Korean who had shared the journey with him to South Korea and had sustained him during the bleakest moments. And there was also South Korea, the country he had longed to reach. Differences stemming from half a century of a divided peninsula, his telltale accent from the North, a word misused, all these things betrayed him as an outsider. He had found, like the 10,000 North Koreans now living in the South and holding South Korean citizenship, that he was not in from the cold, not yet. “When I think about all the things I have to do here, I’m overwhelmed,” he said. “I feel so small.” MR. LEE had bought secondhand appliances and furniture for his apartment, though he had made a point of stocking the living room with a new wall unit and flat-screen television. His favorite television program was “Global Talk Show,” which features single foreign women sharing their experiences of living in South Korea’s homogeneous, sometimes disorienting society. “What they’re feeling is exactly what I feel in South Korea,” he said, adding that his favorite was a half-British, half-Japanese regular named Eva. It had taken Mr. Lee, now 39, almost half of his life to make it to South Korea. His journey began when he was in the military at age 20 and became entangled in a dispute with a superior, Mr. Lee said, declining to reveal details. According to his account, he tried to leave the North but was caught and sentenced to 10 years in prison. After his release, he held a series of jobs ranging from maintaining telephone lines to working in a fertilizer factory. His father, he said, died in the great famine of the late 1990s. Then in late 2005, Mr. Lee made it to China and joined his mother, who had already been living there for a couple of years. After working seven months and earning enough to pay part of the fees to the smugglers, Mr. Lee made it to Bangkok and, following six months in the detention center there, arrived in South Korea, at long last. At the airport here, a fellow North Korean, a young man wearing earrings, was ordered with an expletive by a South Korean security official to take them off. “That was our first impression of South Korea,” Mr. Lee said. “It wasn’t a warm embrace.” Like all North Korean refugees, Mr. Lee was then detained for about a month by the National Intelligence Service. He was interrogated for several days before being put into solitary confinement, he said. He felt intolerably lonely, so he began keeping a diary for the first time in his life. In the only notebook he could obtain, a children’s scrapbook titled “Pinky and Jimmy,” which Mr. Lee now keeps on his bookshelf, he wrote in a clear handwriting of his “suffocating” loneliness in solitary. With a broken television set in his cell, he wrote, “how am I going to get through the night?” He wanted larger portions of food, but could not bear the humiliation of asking the guards, he wrote, adding that he could see “contempt” in their eyes. He longed for his girlfriend, though he could not hide his misgivings. “She lacks perseverance and temperance, just like me,” he wrote. “She cries a lot. She has the most beautiful eyes when she cries. I read in a book somewhere that if you are too emotional, you’ll have a lesser chance of succeeding in life.” Mr. Lee then stayed for a couple of months at Hanawon, an institution that offers North Koreans a crash course on living in the capitalist South. History was retaught, including that it was the North, not the South, that started the Korean War. Mr. Lee said that he had already gleaned the truth from South Korean films and television programs increasingly smuggled in from China. Hanawon also offered computer classes. “I just focused on getting my driver’s license,” he said. MANY North Koreans say that they are treated like second-class citizens in the South. But at the Sorae fish market near Mr. Lee’s apartment, operators of food stands looking for customers called out to him, “Chairman, chairman!” “Everything’s about money here,” he said, dragging on a Dunhill Slim, a popular cigarette here. “You go to work in the morning — you can’t even take phone calls on your cell at work — then you go home and go to sleep. InNorth Korea, there is a fence around people to control them. But it’s very collective, so people help one another out. In that system, people do find ways to have meaningful relations with one another.” As with many North Koreans, Mr. Lee’s nostalgia  about the North increased in direct proportion with his sense of alienation in the South. At a small noodle shop, he asked the owner to turn on the fan but got only a puzzled look because he referred to it with a word used only in the North. It was getting late, and maybe because he had to wake up early for work in the morning, Mr. Lee’s mood darkened. He had already worked three jobs in as many months, including  aboard a small sun-baked fishing boat. He lingered outside a butcher’s shop near his apartment, delaying, it seemed, his return to an empty apartment. After they left Hanawon, he and his girlfriend spent nine days together, then split up. They had shared their journey to South Korea. But, once here, they saw that the reality of their relationship, as with many things, was different from their expectations. “It was so hard to get here,” he said. “Before, I thought that once I got to South Korea, everything would be all right. But now I know that I’ve just opened the front gate and come in. The journey’s just begun.”

South Korea, facing criticism after it agreed Sunday to send 400,000 tons of rice to North Korea despite the North&#8217;s prevarication on a Feb 13 international agreement to shut down its main nuclear reactor, warned that North Korea might not get all the aid if it continued to refuse to live up to its commitment. &#8220;We emphasized that the speed and timing of the aid shipments could be changed depending on the North&#8217;s sincere implementation of the Feb. 13 agreement,&#8221; Lee Jae-Joung, the unification minister, said in a statement. The agreement signed Sunday contained no such preconditions. South Korea is to send the first shipment of rice in late May.

South Korea, facing criticism after it agreed Sunday to send 400,000 tons of rice toNorth Koreadespite the North’s prevarication on a Feb 13 international agreement to shut down its main nuclear reactor, warned that North Korea might not get all the aid if it continued to refuse to live up to its commitment. “We emphasized that the speed and timing of the aid shipments could be changed depending on the North’s sincere implementation of the Feb. 13 agreement,” Lee Jae-Joung, the unification minister, said in a statement. The agreement signed Sunday contained no such preconditions. South Korea is to send the first shipment of rice in late May. Critics from the political opposition and conservative civic groups in Seoul had urged the government not to promise any aid until after the North had made a move to shut down the nuclear reactor.

The general selected as the country’s new defense minister said he supported responding to further North Korean actions with airstrikes.

SEOUL, South Korea — The four-star general chosen asSouth Korea’s new defense minister said on Friday that the South would use airstrikes againstNorth Koreaif it carried out further attacks. “If the enemy attacks our people and territory again, I will use force to punish the enemy to make sure it doesn’t even dare think about it again,” the minister-designate, Kim Kwan-jin, said in confirmation hearings on Friday. Mr. Kim was formally appointed as defense minister on Saturday. His comments provided the first details of a new military posture announced by President Lee Myung-bak last week. Mr. Lee’s government has come under fierce criticism for what is widely seen here as a feeble response to the North Korean shelling of a South Korean island last month. Last week Mr. Leeaccepted the resignation of his defense minister, announced plans to reinforce the island’s defensesand revised the rules of engagement to make it easier for South Korea to respond to a North Korean attack with greater force. Mr. Kim’s comments on Friday were the first to suggest that such a response could include bombing the North from the air. When North Koreashelled Yeonpyeong Islandon Nov. 23, killing two marines and two civilians, the South responded with  artillery and put its fighter jets on alert but they did not take off. Mr. Kim, 61, a former infantry commander who led the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the new rules would also give more authority to commanders in the field. But defense analysts were divided over whether the new policy would be as tough as Mr. Kim’s remarks suggested, or whether it was aimed at appeasing angry conservatives. Moon Chung-in, a professor of political science at Yonsei University in Seoul, said that hawkish comments were to be expected from a new minister, and that Friday’s session  had a typical “handover ambience.” But Choi Jin-wook, an analyst with the conservativeKorea Institute for National Unification, applauded the policy as “a whole new paradigm and a whole new world.” “In the past we have never shown enough deterrence,” he said. “We always said we’d retaliate, but it wasn’t true. When we were provoked before, the military’s first thought was about the aftermath of its response and the politics. But this new policy is different. It’s a big turning point.” A senior analyst at a government defense institute, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the new rules of engagement would also allow pre-emptive strikes on the North if there are indications of a possible attack. The analyst, who advises the Defense Ministry, said that given the North’s superior ground power, “using the air force is a way of balancing the power in the region.” He said the new policy would be likely to allow fighter planes to initiate a dogfight. Under the current policy, “Our aircraft can’t fire first.” But doubts were raised Friday about the South’s limited response under the previous policy. The South Korean military said its artillery response last month inflicted heavy damage on North Korean positions. But satellite images obtained by Stratfor, a geopolitical risk analysis company, showed that “it is not clear whether South Korean counterbattery fire was sufficiently timely to be at all effective,” the company said in a report. North Korea fired 170 rounds, apparently from rocket launchers, and a Stratfor analysis said the munitions “appear to have been incendiary or perhaps even thermobaric, with the intention of starting fires.” A quarter of the shells were found to be duds. In response, South Korea fired 80 rounds from howitzers on the island. But, two of the six guns were out of commission. Satellite photos showed that 14 shells landed in rice paddies and farm fields, and that 35 reportedly splashed into the sea, the South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo reported. The National Intelligence Service said 10 shells landed on or near a North Korean barracks in Mudo. The remaining 21 rounds were unaccounted for.

The government on Wednesday rejected a North Korean request for talks about restarting cross-border tours to the Diamond Mountain resort in the North.

SEOUL, South Korea — The South Korean government on Wednesday rejected a North Korean request for talks about restarting cross-border tours to the Diamond Mountain resort in the North. The tours, which were suspended by the South in 2008, annually brought millions of dollars of hard currency to the cash-strapped North Korean regime. Seoul suspended the Diamond Mountain tours after a South Korean woman was shot and killed there by a North Korean guard, apparently when the woman wandered into a restricted zone. Angered by the suspension of the tours, Pyongyang responded by seizing several South Korean-owned buildings at the jointly operated resort. Seoul has demanded a fuller investigation of the shooting as well as more safeguards for its tourists before tours can begin again. A government official in Seoul said privately that Kim Jong-il has given his personal assurance to the South Korean government that no further incidents will occur at Diamond Mountain, a promise that precludes the need for any further investigation or added security measures, according to the North. North Koreahad proposed holding the tourism talks on Friday, but negotiations about new tours would not be held as long as “the unjust measures” remained in effect, a spokeswoman from the Unification Ministry in Seoul said Wednesday, referring to the seized facilities. In addition to a driving range and a shopping area at the resort, one of the seized buildings is a reunion center where family members separated by the Korean War are reunited in a program overseen by Red Cross groups from both countries. Hundreds of relatives from both sides — most of whom had not seen each other in nearly 60 years —gathered at the centertwo weeks ago in the first set of reunions to be held in more than a year. The two sides are due to meet Nov. 25 to discuss further reunions, which the South wants to enlarge and regularize. Reunion talks have always been held in the North, although Seoul has proposed hosting them this time. North Korea has yet to respond to the suggestion, a Unification Ministry official said. A previous meeting was derailed late last month when North Korea, as a condition for further reunions, requested 500,000 tons of rice and 300,000 tons of fertilizer from the South. Although it acts as a kind of proxy for the government, the South Korean Red Cross delegation said it did not have the authority to approve such large shipments.

Defections have risen markedly in recent years, as economic conditions have worsened in the North.

SEOUL, South Korea — Defections fromNorth Koreahave risen markedly in recent years, South Korean officials said Monday, driven both by worsening economic conditions and more news from abroad filtering into the secretive communist state. About 2,900 people defected to the South last year, said Lee Jong-joo, an official with the Unification Ministry, and more than 2,000 have defected so far this year. She cited “humanitarian reasons, includingthe food situation,” as being among the leading reasons cited for defecting and said that 70 percent of defectors were women. The South Korean government announced on Monday that a 41-year-old woman had become the 20,000th North Korean to defect toSouth Koreasince the end of the Korean War in 1953. Ms. Lee said the woman and her two teenage sons, from Yanggang Province in the northern part of North Korea, defected last week because of economic hardships. Ms. Lee declined to describe their route. Most defectors from Yanggang cross directly into neighboring China and then make their way to South Korea. Defections across the heavily militarized North-South border are nearly impossible because of fences, land mines, sensors and guard posts. Ms. Lee said the woman and her sons, like all defectors, would be sequestered and interrogated by military intelligence agents for about three months. They will then spend another three months inHanawon, a state-run orientation facility that teaches newcomers about South Korean government, society and daily life. They are taught how to shop for groceries and other necessities, open a bank account, use a cellphone, enroll in schools and look for jobs. It isnot always a happy transition, despite the deprivations and political repression in the impoverished North and the relative freedom and material comforts in the South. Northerners are often viewed with suspicion by South Koreans, who see them as rough and unsophisticated. Also, North Korean professionals like architects, engineers and doctors are not automatically licensed in the South and typically have to start their educations from scratch. The first known defector from North Korea was a 21-year-old soldier, Rhee Young-gwang, who sneaked into South Korea on Sept. 18, 1967. At the time, North Korea was far more prosperous and thriving than the South. Mr. Rhee said he had defected “to travel the world,” and his ultimate goal was to retire in Fiji. The government gave him a job with the state power company, but Mr. Rhee found city life in Seoul to be “poor and noisy.” Money, he said, was not his ambition. “What I wanted,” he said, “was freedom.” “Because of my petulant personality, it was difficult for me to get along with other people,” he said at a news conference soon after his defection, and a few months later he went to a police station and asked to be sent back to the North. The request was refused, and Mr. Rhee eventually moved to rural Kangwon Province, northeast of Seoul. A television documentary about Mr. Rhee in 1998 inspired a woman named Park An-ja to seek him out at his mountain home. News reports at the time said she had recently left her husband in the southern city of Pusan and was suicidal, but she quickly became smitten with Mr. Rhee. Within two weeks of their meeting, they married. The most famous North Korean defector wasHwang Jang-yop, who sought asylum in the South Korean Embassy in Beijing in 1997. A former president of Kim Il-sung University and a leading political theoretician in the government’s ruling elite, Mr. Hwang became a bitter critic of the North after he defected, denouncing the current leader, Kim Jong-il, for betraying the country’s founding ideals. Mr. Hwang, who lived in South Korea under police protection, said he was a target of North Korean assassins who sneaked into the South posing as defectors.He died of heart failurelast month while taking a bath. He was 87 and was buried with state honors at a national cemetery.

South Korean authorities have indicted a Christian activist who made an unapproved visit toNorth Korea, the Yonhap news agency said. The agency reported that the activist, the Rev. Han Sang-ryol, was indicted Thursday under the National Security Law for allegedly meeting North Korean secret agents and praising the North during his 70-day visit. Mr. Han was detained last month as he returned home across the heavily fortified border with North Korea. He could face up to seven years in prison if convicted of violating the security law, which bans citizens from having unauthorized contact with North Korea and supporting its Communist government. Another law bars citizens from visiting the North without government permission.

On Sunday, President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea proposed a three-stage unification process: peace and denuclearization, economic integration, and an eventual “community of the Korean nation.” Mr. Lee also proposed a special tax to finance the costs of unification. North Korea criticized the proposal for making nuclear disarmament in the North a precondition for unification. North Korea also criticized Mr. Lee for proposing the unification tax, saying the idea was “very unsavory” because it was aimed at preparing for turmoil in the North.

SEOUL, South Korea — Tens of thousands of South Korean and United States troops began a new round of war games on Monday, asNorth Koreathreatened a “merciless counterblow” amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The drills are the South’s third major exercise — the second conducted with the United States — since the sinking of a South Korean warship in the spring for which the South blamed the North. The 11-day drills are the largest annual joint United States-South Korean military exercises. This year they involve 56,000 South Koreans and 30,000 Americans inSouth Koreaand abroad, some of them working on computer simulations. As a parallel exercise, 400,000 South Korean government employees undertake a civil defense drill, which this year will include a simulated terrorist attack ahead of the G-20 summit meeting to be held in Seoul in November. The North routinely calls the drills warmongering and accuses South Korea and its American ally of preparing for an invasion. North Korea has for years pursued nuclear weapons for what it describes as a deterrent to foreign attacks. This year the North took action in addition to its belligerent statements, firing 110 artillery shells on a disputed western sea border with the South last Monday. South Korea belatedly revealed that some of the rounds fell south of the disputed sea border, but its military did not respond despite previous vows to do so. The joint drills that began Monday are called Ulchi Freedom Guardian, in honor of a Korean general from the seventh century who Korean historians say routed a Chinese invasion. On Monday, President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea repeated his country’s stance that the drills were defensive. “Our Ulchi exercises are for peace and for deterring war,” he was quoted as saying while presiding over a cabinet meeting in an underground bunker at the presidential Blue House. “Only when we are thoroughly prepared can we prevent war and defend peace.” Mr. Lee and other cabinet members were all dressed in pea-green uniforms, as is the custom during their civil defense exercises. South Koreans have grown used to repeated North Korean threats of “sea of fire” or “nuclear holocaust” — so much so that such language no longer attracts much attention here, despite the recent increase in tension. At the same time, there is a growing fear in Seoul that North Korea’s leadership may be increasingly confident that its nuclear arsenal will allow it to engage in military provocations with impunity. In addition, some United States officials have suggested that North Korea may be engaged in a new wave of aggression as its leader, Kim Jong-il, tries to establish credentials for his youngest son as a possible successor. Mr. Kim suffered a stroke in 2008; the son, Kim Jong-un, is believed to be in his late 20s. North Korea’s propaganda artists have manufactured large volumes of portraits and badges bearing the son’s image, reported Open Radio for North Korea, a Web site based in Seoul that gathers news from sources inside the North. It also said that all North Koreans are required to keep the portraits of Kim Jong-il and his father, President Kim Il-sung, on a wall of their homes and now must wear a Kim Il-sung pin — or less often, a Kim Jong-il pin — on their chest. The new Kim Jong-un badges may be distributed to party officials early next month, when North Korea has said it would convene a large meeting of party members in the capital, Pyongyang. Officials in Seoul said they could not confirm the report. Also on Monday, the government-run research group Korea Development Institute revealed a report prepared for President Lee that said that it would cost South Korea $2.1 trillion over 30 years to absorb North Korea if the North Korean government suddenly collapsed with the death of Kim Jong-il. If South Korea succeeded in persuading the North to open up for a gradual economic integration with the South, the cost of unification would be around $322 billion, it said. On Sunday, Mr. Lee called for a “unification tax” to finance the cost of rejoining North Korea. The two Koreas were divided at the end of World War II.

Instant reunification remains unlikely, but the passing of Kim Jong-il would pave the way for change.
==::==

SEOUL — It is 20 years since, in the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall, China and the Soviet Union began to normalize relations with South Korea. So its been 20 years since I, like many others, started writing scenarios for the end of the Kim dynasty in the North, and how the South might handle the costs of creating a single nation. Twenty years of hopes lie in ruins.  The economic gap between the two countries has widened, the North has nuclear weapons, and another generation of the Kim Il-sung line waits in the wings. Scenarios for change in North Korea, let alone reunification, are few. Yet it is not futile to think that radical change is possible in the foreseeable future. One cause for hope is that Kim Jong-il’s health is failing, possibly bringing an end to the Kim dynasty. After all, it took Kim Jong-il several years after the death in 1994 of his father, Kim Il-sung, to solidify power, even though he had been groomed for succession for years. The youngest of Kim Jong-il’s three sons, Kim Jong-un, who appears to be his anointed successor, is believed to be about 28 and lacks experience. But he may have a couple of years to establish himself. After the death of Kim Jong-il, the army may prefer to keep the young Kim as titular leader while it controls the power structure. The army has for so long been linked with Kim family mythology that a dynastic succession may be necessary. But even that does not necessarily mean a continuation of Kim policies. Instead of claiming legitimacy as the defenders of Korean national integrity via its nuclear accomplishments, as Kim Jong-il has done, the new regime could shift to a China-style emphasis on the economy. Though that might ultimately undermine the power of the current elite, it could present them with the opportunity to become rich like their counterparts in Myanmar. There could even be a more radical shift from Kim ideology in the manner of de-Stalinization or de-Maoification. Do we have evidence for the existence of such sentiments? Not really. But jealousies must abound within this tight-knit, secretive power structure, and if the Kims are overthrown new policies will likely follow. The second cause for hope is the rising diplomatic cost to China of sustaining the status quo. Recently, China has reinforced its support for the North, welcoming Kim Jong-il to Beijing and strongly criticizing U.S.-South Korean naval exercises. China has a strong interest in maintaining a buffer state between itself and the forces of the United States and its allies. Yet Beijing must realize that the North’s behavior legitimizes America’s presence in South Korea and encourages Japan to increase defense spending. South Korea is wary of relying too much on the China, now its largest market. Elsewhere in Asia, support for the North is seen as unworthy of a China which aspires to international leadership. Beijing cannot abandon the North, but it would surely reward a major change in Pyongyang’s policies, or even promote an anti-Kim faction. A third cause for hope may, paradoxically, be a growing reluctance in the South to take a confrontational stance against provocation. For sure, President Lee Myung-bak’s recent cabinet reshuffle showed he is not backing off from a hard line. But it might not need a huge shift in Pyongyang to open the way for a revival of the so-called Sunshine policy, and a subsequent agreement to halt nuclear development in exchange for U.S. recognition. Instant reunification along German lines remains unlikely. None of the neighbors want it, and the demilitarized zone is a barrier of mines and forest that cannot be quickly dismantled. But a popular, Romanian-style uprising in the North is not impossible in this highly urbanized society if power struggles within army and party come into the open. Moreover, reunification may not prove to be quite as costly as is often assumed. The South has a labor shortage while the North has a literate workforce and offers huge opportunities for Southern companies to rebuild its infrastructure. The odds on reunification in the foreseeable future remain long. But chances for radical change in the North are less so. Although hopes have for so long been dashed, there is no reason to believe that things will never change.

People along the rivers and beaches near the Korean border were confronted by a deadly surprise  as dozens of mines from the North washed up in flooding.

SEOUL, South Korea — Dozens of North Korean land mines loosened by heavy rains have washed ashore on South Korean riverbanks and beaches near the border, presenting a lethal new threat to residents already wary of surprises and nefarious motives from the North. A man in the South Korean border town of Yeoncheon, northeast of Seoul, was killed Saturday when one of two land mines he had picked up from a stream exploded, the Defense Ministry said. A friend was seriously injured and hospitalized. The scare came amid heightened vigilance againstNorth Korea, following the March sinking of a South Korean warship in border waters that was widely thought to be caused by a North Korean torpedo attack. On Sunday,South Koreasent a message urging North Korea to prevent its land mines from washing downstream to the South, the Defense Ministry said in a statement. The authorities also distributed pamphlets, which carried photos of the North Korean mines, warning people living near the border not to touch objects that look like the land mines. In towns and islands downstream from North Korea, officials using megaphones urged villagers and vacationers to stay off the streams and beaches. Soldiers with minesweepers were searching river beds where the floods have retreated. Since Friday, they have found 35 land mines. The mines, built in wooden boxes, were designed to explode when pressed or opened. “The mines were apparently swept down from North Korea after torrential rains,” said an official from the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing his office’s policy. He said that the safety pins of some recovered mines were not removed, indicating that they had been in storage when they were swept away. Heavy rains were reported north of the border in recent weeks. North Korea, where most mountains are denuded, is vulnerable to landslides and floods. Bodies of North Koreans are occasionally found downstream in the South after heavy rains. The two-and-a-half-mile-wide Demilitarized Zone, which divides the two Koreas, and the land immediately adjacent to it on either side are heavily seeded with land mines to guard against infiltration by soldiers from the North or South. In South Korean villages near the front line, it is not unusual to find farmers who have lost arms or legs by stepping on the mines. But few South Korean civilians have been reported killed by North Korean land mines in the post-Korean War years. After the sinking of the ship, South Koreans remain wary of the North, which has a history of unpredictability. In September last year, it astonished South Koreans by releasing water from one of its dams without notice, causing a flash flood across the border. Six South Koreans were drowned downstream. North Korea recently discharged water from dams north of a river flowing to South Korea, but it notified the South in advance, giving it time to evacuate vacationers and others downstream.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A South Korean court sentenced two North Korean army majors to 10 years in prison on Thursday for plotting to assassinate Hwang Jang-yop, 87, a high-ranking defector who once mentoredNorth Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-il, and is now a bitter critic of the North. The defendants, Kim Myong-ho and Dong Myong-gwan, convicted of violating the National Security Law, have seven days to appeal the verdict. Posing as defectors, they were arrested in Seoul in April. North Korea has denied the assassination plot.

JINDONG, South Korea — The ginseng field owned by Yun Ok-hwa lies just a minute’s walk from the demilitarized zone that divides South andNorth Korea. As a cuckoo sang in a nearby acacia grove recently, its melodic call was punctuated by a more ominous sound, the pounding of South Korean artillery. And if South and North Korea follow through on theirthreatsin the wake of thesinking of a South Koreanwarship in March, Ms. Yun could soon hear other sounds: high-powered South Korean loudspeakers blaring propaganda across the border and North Korean guns blasting at the speakers. “I’m afraid things are going back to the old days,” Ms. Yun, 58, said. “It takes six years to grow and harvest ginseng. Here I have roots that are two, three, four, six years old — a big investment. If something happens with North Korea, I’ll lose everything.” An estimated 20,000 South Koreans like Ms. Yun are carving out a living just below the demilitarized zone under special military permits that allow them to cultivate an area that is off limits to other civilians and that is guarded by soldiers and minefields. Their anxiety over the threat to their livelihoods echoes that of South Koreans in general at living in one of the world’s most prosperous countries, next to one of the world’s poorest and most isolated. They express a peculiar mix of bitterness and resignation at the bonds of geography and kinship they share with their northern neighbors. “They are a brainwashed people, a nation of desperadoes, an army of suicide bombers,” Ms. Yun said. Gazing over the black plastic sheeting covering her ginseng she added, “If war breaks out, we have far more to lose than the North Koreans do.” Over the decades,South Korea’s response to the North’s provocations has shifted from calls for retaliation (“The best medicine for a rabid dog is a club” was a slogan popular in the 1970s) to the more recent “sunshine policy” of pouring aid into the North to encourage it to shed its hostility. Neither approach worked as the South had hoped. Now, President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea has seized on the sinking of the ship, the 1,200-tonCheonan, and the deaths of 46 sailors, to focus his tougher, dual approach of putting unilateral and international pressure on the North. He has severed most trade and contacts with the North and vowed to resume the propaganda broadcasts. Until 2004, when both North and South silenced their loudspeakers, such broadcasts were part of daily life for farmers and soldiers around this border town north of Seoul. Each morning, a sweet-voiced North Korean woman greeted the South Koreans and exhorted them throughout the day to defect to the “socialist paradise.” From the other side, a South Korean woman updated North Korean soldiers on the collapse of the Soviet bloc and asked: “Have you filled your empty stomach today? Come to the South, a land of prosperity and freedom!” In the new confrontation with the North, Mr. Lee’s aides say that the president thinks that time is on his side and that he needs to keep the pressure on. The North’s economy is a shambles. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, is ill, and the leadership abilities of his third son and reported heir, Kim Jong-un, 27, are untested. But Mr. Kim’s government survived a famine in the mid-1990s with its grip on power intact. China continues to funnel emergency aid to help bolster North Korea, which sees United Nations sanctions as proof of foreign hostility and a justification for its continued development of nuclear weapons. “There is a sense of resignation when South Koreans sigh at North Korean provocations, saying, ‘There they go again,’ ” said Chang Yong-seok, a North Korea expert at Sungkonghoe University in Seoul, the South’s capital. “They appear indifferent because they know that neither side can risk a war. To them, North Korea is like a desperate gangster wielding a knife who has to be bought off with some cash.” Mr. Chang says that Mr. Lee’s tough talk — he says the president is seeking an “implosion” of the North Korean government — does serve to provide an “ideological catharsis” for his conservative base. But it could eventually fail, Mr. Chang said, because such outside pressure deepens North Koreans’ hostility toward the South and strengthens their solidarity with Mr. Kim’s government. This political conundrum has spawned a bizarre coexistence of peace and tension along the Korean demilitarized zone, itself a misnomer  because, 57 years after the Korean War ended with a truce but no peace treaty, this remains the world’s most heavily armed border. Ms. Yun and her husband, Lee Gwang-nam, 86, had to clear 400 land mines to cultivate her ginseng field. In the nearby village of Jangpa-ri, a community of 500 households, more than a dozen people have been killed or maimed over the years by stepping on mines or mishandling stray bombs. Among them was Mr. Lee’s second son, who lost an arm and a leg. A neighbor, Woo Jae-ok, an 85-year-old rice farmer, said he was disappointed that President Lee had not ordered some sort of military retaliation for the sinking of the Cheonan. Mr. Woo, who fled the North during the 1951-53 war, left behind his family, including a 4-year-old daughter he never saw again. For him, the war has not ended. “We should smash the North Korean regime to liberate its people,” he said. “I’m losing any hope of ever returning home.” If Mr. Woo is consumed with hatred of the North Korean government, his son, Woo Kyong-bok, who was born in the South two years after the war ended, directs much of his anger at the United States military, which operates gunnery ranges near Jangpa-ri. Until American officials agreed on a detour in 2003, their tanks routinely rumbled through the village, “shaking our floor at 4 a.m. and causing our cows to miscarry,” the son said. Now, his complaint is a drop in land values. When South Korea pursued its so-called sunshine policy, word spread that the Koreas would build a joint industrial park near the village, like the one they built in Kaesong, a North Korean border town.  Real estate agents rushed up from Seoul. Property prices more than doubled. “Now,” the younger Mr. Woo said, “there’s no more interest in the land here.”

SEOUL, South Korea — Officials investigating the mysterious sinking of a South Korean warship in waters disputed byNorth Koreabelieve that the ship was hit and torn apart by an “external explosion,” the government announced Friday. Its first official statement on the cause of the sinking came amid rising official and private speculation over a possible North Korean involvement. “It was highly likely that it was an external, rather than internal, explosion,” Yoon Duk-yong, head of the government team of military and private investigators, said at a nationally televised news conference. The news conference came a day after the stern of the ship was lifted out of the water, allowing investigators to look more closely at the damage. Officials also found 36 dead sailors inside, bringing the death toll to 38. Eight sailors remain missing, while 58 were rescued the night the ship sank. It will take more investigation to determine what and who may have caused the external impact, said Lieutenant General Park Jong-yi. ButSouth Korea’s defense minister, Kim Tae-young, had earlier said that it was investigating the possibility that the 1,200-ton ship, the Cheonan, was hit by a North Korean torpedo or naval mine. Mr. Yoon said his team found an internal explosion unlikely after studying the salvaged ship. The ship’s munition, fuel tank and gas turbine were intact. The investigators also all but ruled out the possibility of the ship hitting an underwater rock. South Korea is working together with United States, Australian and Swedish experts. The result of the investigations, especially if North Korea were found guilty, could have tremendous implications not only for inter-Korean relations but also for international efforts to coax North Korea back to nuclear disarmament talks.

Crew members who survived the sinking of a South Korean warship said Thursday they were convinced the explosion came from outside the ship.

SEOUL, South Korea — It could take weeks for engineers to salvage the South Korean warship  thatsank in waters disputed by North Korea after a mysterious explosionand provide a definitive explanation of what caused the disaster. But some signs are pointing  toNorth Korea, raising uncomfortable questions for the South’s government. On Thursday, surviving crew members went public with their account, saying they were convinced that the explosion came from outside the ship. That follows remarks last week by Defense Minister Kim Tae-young before the National Assembly that the military had not ruled out the possibility that the ship was hit by a mine or torpedo. Mr. Kim added, “A more likely possibility is a torpedo attack.” If North Korea is ultimately found culpable, it will amount to one of the most serious military provocations since the Korean War ended in a truce, leaving the peninsula technically in a state of war. But what optionsSouth Koreamay have to retaliate is a difficult issue for the South. The delicacy of the matter was on full display during Mr. Kim’s testimony. No sooner had he raised the possibility of a torpedo attack than he was handed a hurriedly dictated note from the office of President Lee Myung-bak. It warned him not to “lean too much toward the torpedo attack” and to stick to the official stance: keeping all possibilities open until the ship was salvaged and examined for the cause of its sinking. The stakes are obviously enormous, both for Mr. Lee and for the future of six-nation talks the United States hopes to reconvene to discuss eliminating the North’snuclear weaponsprogram. If the ship, the Cheonan, was sunk by a North Korean attack, then the action almost certainly was approved in advance by the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, said Won Se-hoon, director of the National Intelligence Service, South Korea’s top spy agency, in a conversation with lawmakers on Tuesday. But if that was the case, what was the motivation for the attack? Some experts have speculated that it was a desperate attempt at score-settling by the  North Korean military, which was overpowered by its South Korean counterpart during three recent naval skirmishes. Others have tied it to the fallout from a succession struggle thought to be under way in North Korea, with the military trying to demonstrate its mettle to Kim Jong-un, Kim Jong-il’s youngest son, who is being prepared to take over from his ailing father. Then again, North Korea has a long history of provoking trouble when the South is preparing for major international events. In  1987, North Korean agents blew up a Korean passenger jet over the sea near Myanmar, killing all 115 on board and shaking South Korea only months before the 1988 Olympic Games. In 2002, North Korea set off a naval clash while South Korea was a co-host of World Cup soccer matches. In November, South Korea is set to host the Group of 20 summit meeting. Experts also note the North’s traditional tactic of lashing out with unexpected provocations — like missile and nuclear tests — when it most needs outside attention and aid. This might be one of those times, analysts say. Kim Jong-il is believed to have suffered a stroke in 2008. He has vowed to build a “strong and prosperous nation” by 2012, when his son is widely expected to be announced as his political heir. But thecountry’s economic woes and food shortagesworsened sharply after its botched attempt to arrest inflation with a disastrous currency revaluation late last year. Ha Tae-keung, who runsOpen Radio for North Korea, a Web site based in Seoul that collects news from informants inside North Korea, said that many North Korean elites believed that their military sank the ship, although they have not produced any proof. The North Korean military has been increasing its submarine capabilities to compensate for its decrepit naval fleet, especially after its defeat in a brief naval clash last November, Mr. Ha said. “It must demonstrate that it remains a threat to the South,” he said. “It gets aid not by openness but by blackmailing.” Mr. Lee won the presidency in 2008 primarily on a promise to stop coddling the North, reversing  the “sunshine policy” of his more liberal predecessors. He has vowed to make the inquiry as international as possible, inviting American and United Nations investigators. “We need a thorough and scientific investigation whose outcome the rest of the world can accept,” President Lee told his cabinet on Tuesday. “Based on such a conclusion, the government can take a stern position.” Despite all that, there are strong reasons to doubt he will come down hard on the North. South Korea’s reactions to past provocations have hardly been ferocious, ranging from plotting revenge attacks (but never carrying them out) to coaxing the North back to the negotiating table with more aid. Beyond that, experts say, anything it does may only make things worse. “In the current situation, Seoul has no way to retaliate,” said Andrei Lankov, a North Korea expert at Kookmin University in Seoul. “So, it is better to wait until things calm down, so the government will not be under pressure ‘to do something’ in a situation when all possible actions are counterproductive or dangerous.” Mr. Lee’s political opponents are already claiming that he is exaggerating the possibility of North Korean involvement to rally conservative votes ahead of crucial mayoral and gubernatorial elections in June. It is possible that the mystery of what caused the explosion  will remain unsolved, some experts on Korean affairs said.  “An underlying problem here is whether clear knowledge of the causes of the Cheonan sinking will be attainable, even after salvaging the ship,” said  John Delury, a North Korea expert and the associate director of the Asia Society’sCenter on U.S.-China Relations, in New York.

North Korea fired artillery shells into waters near its disputed western sea border with South Korea, and the South Korean military returned warning shots from smaller weapons.

SEOUL, South Korea  —North Koreafired dozens of artillery shells on Wednesday from its shoreline into waters near its disputed western sea border withSouth Korea, and the South Korean military returned warning shots from smaller weapons, according to South Korean military officials and fishermen on a border island. After the morning barrage, South Korea issued three warning broadcasts and then its marines based on a border island unleashed about 100 warning shots with their antiaircraft guns. Neither side reported casualties or damage. The North Korean military warned in a statement that more shells would be on their way as part of a  winter training exercise, highlighting instability in the western waters, the most volatile segment of the Koreas’ border. On Wednesday morning, about 30 rounds of North Korean artillery splashed into two spots just north of the so-called Northern Limit Line, a United Nations-drawn sea border accepted  by the South but disputed by the North, said a spokesman at the  Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Seoul, who spoke on condition of anonymity until the government made a formal announcement. Hours later, North Korea fired a new barrage involving “tens of shells,” the official said. The rising tension at sea comes amid recent signals from Pyongyang that it was ready to return six-nation talks on ending itsnuclear weaponsprogram. In return for resuming the talks, North Korea has demanded talks on a peace treaty with the United States to formally end the 1950-3 Korean War and the lifting of United Nations sanctions tightened after its two nuclear tests. When North Korea wants to highlight instability along the frontier and thus the need for a permanent peace treaty, it often reasserts its territorial claims and warns of military clashes on the western sea. The exchange of fire startled residents of Baengnyeong, the border island. “We panicked a little because it was so loud and more fierce than their usual training,” said Kim Oe-sun, a shop owner on Baengnyeong Island, referring to the firing from the marine brigade stationed there. Oh Baek-kyun, another Baengnyeong resident, said in a telephone interview: “It’s life as usual here. But a cargo ship bound for our island turned around because of what had happened out on the sea.” On Tuesday, North Korea declared two no-sail zones straddling the disputed sea border. It usually designates such zones when its military conducts missile or artillery drills. But the locations of the latest firing zones raised fears that North Korea might fire shells into South Korean-controlled waters to enforce a territorial claim, draw the South into dialogue and win economic concessions. In the past week, the two Koreas have engaged in harsh exchanges, with the North threatening a “holy war to blow away” the Seoul government and the South warning that it would launch pre-emptive military strikes if it saw clear signs of an imminent  nuclear attack from the North. The incident  on Wednesday came after patrol ships from the two Koreas exchanged fire in the area in November. One North Korean sailor was believed to have been  killed and three others wounded in that fighting, according to the South, which did not suffer casualties. The two navies also fought bloody skirmishes in the disputed waters in 1999 and 2002. In a message to the North, South Korea expressed “grave concern,” accusing the North Korean military of “creating unnecessary tension through live-shell artillery fire.” But the North Korean military said, “No one can argue about our premeditated exercises.” Its statement was carried by the North’s state-run news agency, K.C.N.A. South Korea said ferry services were not interrupted to  South Korean islands that lied within the range of North Korean shore guns, whose shells can travel up to 17 miles. Baengnyeong Island lies 10 miles  from the North Korean shore. South Korean marines maintain their barracks behind hills facing the North as a precaution against any attack. Civilians, most of them fishermen, are trained to run for military bunkers and pick up arms if a North Korean attack begins.

South Korea would launch a pre-emptive strike against the North if there were signs of an impending nuclear attack, the South Korean defense minister said Wednesday.

SEOUL, South Korea  —South Koreawould  launch a pre-emptive conventional strike against  the  North if there were clear indications of an impending nuclear attack, the South Korean defense minister said Wednesday in Seoul, even as both countries were holding talks about improvements at their jointly operated industrial park. The comment by the defense minister, Kim Tae-young, reconfirmed the South Korean military’s stance on the possibility of a nuclear strike by the North, ministry officials said. But it also marked another exchange of tough talk between two militaries. Last Friday,North Korea’s National Defense Commissionthreatened a “holy warto blow away” the South, denouncing Seoul over unconfirmed news reports that the South has recently drawn up contingency plans for a potential collapse of the government in Pyongyang. “A nuclear attack from the North would cause too much damage for us to react,” Mr. Kim said, speaking at a security seminar on Wednesday. “We must detect signs, and if there is a clear sign of attack, we must immediately strike. Unless it’s a case where we would sustain an attack but still could counterattack, we must strike first.” Mr. Kim made a similar comment in 2008 when he was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.North Korea respondedat the time with threats of war, vowing to reduce the South to “ashes.” The Koreas are still technically at war because the 1950-3 Korean War ended with a truce and not a formal peace treaty. Even withoutnuclear weapons, North Korea’s military remains a serious  threat to the South. Seoul, the capital of South Korea and its largest city, is  within range of North Korean rockets and artillery deployed along the border, just 30 miles away. Within minutes of the start of a war, North Korean artillery would roll out of underground bunkers and rain shells on Seoul, wiping out much of the capital, according to South Korean officials and military analysts. South Korea says it has no nuclear weapons on its territory, although both Seoul and Washington have emphasized that the United States keeps the South under its nuclear umbrella. There was no immediate comment from the American military or the United States  Embassy in Seoul about Mr. Kim’s comments. United States military officials and diplomats usually decline to comment on any potential military conflict with the North, except to say that the American and South Korean militaries remain at the ready. Meanwhile, officials from both Koreas held a second day of talks on the future of their joint industrial complex at Kaesong, a North Korean border town north of Seoul. The officials were following up on fact-finding trips they made together to industrial parks in China and Vietnam in December. During the talks, South Korea stressed the need for more efficient border crossings and customs clearance for South Koreans who travel to and from Kaesong. The meetings were “serious and practical,” said Chun Hae-sung, a spokesman for the South’s Unification Ministry. About 110 South Korean factories employ  42,000 North Korean workers at Kaesong in a pilot project to combine South Korean capital with North Korean labor. But the future of the venture has been clouded by political tensions between the two sides. The latest inter-Korean talks, which began Tuesday at Kaesong, came amid  mixed signals from North Korea. Last weekend, the North threatened to break off all dialogue with Seoul and its state-run media showed the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, observing a  military exercise . This came only days after the North proposed talks with the South on developing business, tourism and aid. “North Korea is mixing dialogue with threats,” said Mr. Kim, the South Korean defense chief. “We must take a strong stance while keeping the window open for dialogue.” Also on Wednesday, Wi Sung-lac, South Korea’s top negotiator on security issues on the Korean peninsula,  left for the United States to meet withStephen W. Bosworth, the American special envoy on North Korea. They were to discuss how to bring the North back to six-party talks on ending its nuclear weapons programs. North Korea insists on the lifting of sanctions and the beginning of bilateral talks with the United States on a peace treaty before it decides to return to the six-party talks.

North Korea unleashed walls of water from one of its dams Sunday, sending a flash flood roaring through the border with South Korea, killing six South Koreans.

SEOUL,South Korea—North Koreaunleashed walls of water from one or more of its dams on Sunday, sending a flash flood roaring through the heavily armed border with South Korea and sweeping away six South Koreans, officials in Seoul said. The six South Koreans, who are still missing, include an 8-year-old boy. They were camping or fishing on the Imjin River, which flows from the North, enters South Korea north of Seoul, and meanders close to the border before emptying into the Yellow Sea. “The government will send a telegram to the North on Monday to protest and demand a satisfying explanation,” the Unification Ministry of South Korea said in a statement. Officials said the Imjin River’s water level on the border doubled, to 15.1 feet, after North Korea began releasing water without warning at 2 a.m. on Sunday, either from its newly built Hwanggang Dam 17 miles north of the border or from a smaller dam downstream. No heavy rain was reported in North Korea in recent days, according to South Korean weather officials. It remained unclear whether the North unleashed the water by accident or to provoke the South. In recent weeks, North Korea has alternated harsh statements andclaims of nuclear advanceswithconciliatory gestures, as tensions ran high over international sanctions imposed on the Communist state following its nuclear test in May. Also Sunday, a body believed to be that of a North Korean boy swept downstream in the Imjin River was found just south of the border, the police said. South Koreans have long feared that North Korea could unleash a water offensive by releasing monstrous columns of water from dams it has been building along the mountainous border in recent decades. The North set off the first so-called water panic in Seoul in 1986, when it was discovered that the secretive government, known for digging invasion tunnels under the border, was building a massive dam upstream on the Han River, which cuts through the South Korean capital. South Korea feared that a sudden release of water from the dam could submerge part of Seoul, and hurried to build a counter-dam downstream called Peace Dam. Short of cash and fuel, North Korea has been building dams for electricity.

An agreement between North and South Korea will allow tourism and family reunions to resume.

HONG KONG —North Koreasaid Monday that it would open its highly militarized border withSouth Koreato allow periodic family reunions and group visits by tourists from the South. The conciliatory move, coming just after thehigh-profile releases of two American journalistsanda South Korean workerdetained by the North, seemed likely to ease the growing anxiety on the Korean peninsula. Tensions had escalated since spring, beginning with the imprisonment of the Americans, the North’ssecond nuclear test in May, a series of missile tests and North Korea’s refusal to re-engage in six-nation talks over itsnuclear weapons. But the North, in the announcement Monday by its official news agency, also warned the United States and South Korea about their joint military exercises, which the North said were “obviously maneuvers for a war of aggression.” It said an “annihilating” retaliation could be one consequence. Still, that kind of bellicose language is almost standard from the North and was eclipsed by its outreach about the border and tourism. Analysts have said North Korea is eager to re-establish contacts with Washington and Seoul in hopes of undermining the United Nations’ sanctions over its nuclear program. The North said it would allow reunions of Korean families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War, with visits taking place at Mount Kumgang, or Diamond Mountain, during the three-day Harvest Moon Festival, when Koreans traditionally visit their hometowns. This year the festival begins Oct. 3. Regular visits to Mount Kumgang on North Korea’s eastern coast will start “as soon as possible,” the official North Korean news agency reported, as well as visits to the ancient border town of Kaesong. Programs allowing tour groups — predominantly South Koreans — to visit the North were expanded in October 2007 but were stopped last year when a South Korean tourist at Kumgang who apparently entered a restricted zone was fatally shot by a North Korean guard. The announcement on Monday followed a meeting Sunday between the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, and the chairwoman of the Hyundai Group, the South Korean conglomerate, which is the biggest investor in the North. The chairwoman, Hyun Jung-eun, had successfully negotiated the release of a Hyundai worker whom the North held for several months on charges of denouncing the government and encouraging defections.

SEOUL,South Korea—North Koreaon Thursday released a South Korean worker it had held for several months on charges of denouncing its political system, signaling what analysts called a desire by the North to ease relations with the South after months of tensions over itsnuclear weaponsprogram. The South Korean worker, Yoo Seong-jin, 44, was handed over to South Korean officials in Kaesong, a North Korean border town where the two Koreas run a joint industrial park. The man crossed the border and was reunited with his family later Thursday. “I am glad that I have safely returned home,” Mr. Yoo said, thanking the government for helping secure his release. He did not answer questions from a crowd of reporters who waited near the border for his arrival. Mr. Yoo, a technician for the Hyundai Group, was detained on March 30 by the North Korean authorities, who accused him of denouncing the North Korean government and trying to persuade a North Korean woman working at Kaesong to defect to the South. During his detention, he was not allowed to talk to South Korean officials. Mr. Yoo’s release removes an obstacle in inter-Korean relations. It came a week after the North freed two American journalists it had held since mid-March on charges of illegal entry and committing hostile acts against the government. North Koreareleased the two journalistsafter former President Bill Clinton visited Pyongyang, the capital, and met the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il. Hyun Jung-eun, the head of the Hyundai Group, South Korea’s biggest corporate investor in the North, visited Pyongyang to negotiate Mr. Yoo’s release, and Mr. Yoo was freed during her visit. It remained unclear whether Ms. Hyun had met Mr. Kim during the negotiations. The North is still holding four South Korean fishermen whose boat was seized two weeks ago after it had strayed into North Korean waters. Analysts have said that North Korea is using the visits by Mr. Clinton and Ms. Hyun to re-establish contacts with Washington and Seoul in hopes of undermining the impact of United Nations sanctions imposed after its nuclear test on May 25. By inviting the Hyundai chief to Pyongyang, North Korea signaled its willingness to revive private business exchanges with South Korea, a crucial source of hard currency for the government, said Chun Hyun-joon, an analyst at the government-financed Korea Research Institute for National Unification in Seoul. “It still is too early to say that this will lead to a resumption of official dialogue between the two sides,” Mr. Chun said. Even before the nuclear test, inter-Korean relations had been at their lowest point in years. President Lee Myung-bak in Seoul vowed not to ship any aid to the North unless it made tangible progress in dismantling its nuclear weapons program. The North responded by curtailing border traffic and suspending Hyundai’s business taking South Korean tourists to Kaesong. North Korea has alternated between conciliatory steps and moves that raise tension. Mr. Lee is preparing to address the nation on Saturday, the anniversary of Korea’s liberation from Japanese colonial rule. The day has traditionally served as an occasion for South Korean leaders to make overtures to the North.

The threat escalated a standoff over the shooting death of a South Korean woman visiting a resort in the North.

2008-08-04T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL,South Korea—North Koreaon Sunday escalated a standoff over the shooting death of a South Korean woman visiting a tourist resort in the North. It threatened to expel South Koreans on the resort’s staff, a move that would effectively shut down a showcase of reconciliation between the two Koreas, as modest as it has been. South Korea said in reply that it would continue to bar South Korean tourists from the resort, a principal source of foreign exchange for North Korea, until the North accepted a joint investigation of the killing of the woman, Park Wang-ja. Relations between the  Koreas have chilled under President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea, who took office in February with a promise to be tougher on the North. They have further deteriorated since July 11, when a North Korean soldier shot and killed Ms. Park, who had wandered into a restricted zone while visiting the scenic Kumgang Mountain resort, at the southeastern tip of North Korea. North Korea — and some critics of the government in the South — sees Mr. Lee’s stiffer stance toward the North as an effort to bolster his conservative credentials, which were badly damaged by virulent antigovernment protests over his decision to lift an import ban on American beef. But officials in Seoul deny they are driven by domestic politics. A North Korean military spokesman said Sunday that the country would expel from the resort South Koreans “deemed unnecessary.” More than 260 South Koreans remain at Kumgang, mostly workers for Hyundai Asan, a Seoul-based company that operates the resort with the North Korean government. The spokesman said the North Korean Army would act against “even the slightest hostile actions” in and around the tourist zone. His statement, issued by the state-run Korean Central News Agency, said he spoke on behalf of “higher authorities” — usually an allusion to the National Defense Commission, the highest decision-making body, presided over by North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-il. The flare-up occurred three days before President Bush was to meet with Mr. Lee in Seoul, on Wednesday. Dealing with the North, most notably over its nuclear weapons program, tops the agenda. On Friday, Mr. Lee is expected to encounter Kim Yong-nam, North Korea’s second-highest official, at the opening of the Olympic Games in Beijing, South Korean officials said. Relations are no less frosty in that arena. North Korea has scorned South Korea’s suggestion that their Olympic teams march together during the ceremony. North Korea said its military had acted properly at the resort, when it spotted Ms. Park, warned her to stop and shot her only as she ran away. The South said the killing was an excessive use of force against an unarmed woman. On Friday, the South said simulations  indicated that she  had been shot while walking slowly or standing. South Korea has repeatedly demanded that the North allow in South Korean investigators. In reply, the North has accused Mr. Lee of seizing on a pretext not to honor  agreements between Mr. Kim and Mr. Lee’s liberal predecessors that called for substantial investment in the impoverished North. Kumgang, which opened to South Korean tourists in 1998, was the first major joint venture between the  Koreas, still technically at war. About two million tourists have visited there, raising hopes for more economic exchanges between the  sides. But critics of North Korea say the venture has provided millions of dollars that may have financed North Korea’s weapons programs.

North Korea unleashed a propaganda tirade against South Korea’s new president, Lee Myung-bak, calling him a “traitor” and “U.S. sycophant.”

SEOUL,South Korea—North Koreaunleashed a propaganda tirade against South Korea’s new president,Lee Myung-bak, on Tuesday, calling him a “traitor” and a “U.S. sycophant” and saying that his policies could spell disaster for international efforts to end the North’s nuclear weapons program. The outburst was the first time in eight years the North had insulted a South Korean president, a clear sign that inter-Korean relations were chilling after a decade of reconciliation. Mr. Lee is scheduled to hold a summit meeting on April 18 with President Bush at Camp David, where they will discuss strategies for dealing with North Korea. Mr. Lee “is making a mess of the process to denuclearize the peninsula,” said a lengthy commentary in Rodong Sinmun, the North’s most authoritative state-run newspaper. “The Lee regime will be held fully accountable for the irrevocable catastrophic consequences to be entailed.” Arriving in Seoul hours after the North Korean statement, the United States envoy to nuclear talks with North Korea, Christopher R. Hill, warned that North Korea would have nothing to gain by using the rising tension with Seoul as another excuse to stall the negotiations. “It’s time to settle now,” Mr. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, said in comments to reporters at the airport in Seoul. Unlike South Korea’s two previous presidents, who both pushed for reconciliation with the North, sometimes in conflict with the United States, Mr. Lee champions a tougher line on North Korea and does not shy away from provoking its leadership. This is presenting Mr. Bush with a new problem at a time when he is more eager to clinch a nuclear disarmament deal. “Is it helpful? I certainly don’t think so,” the State Department’s deputy spokesman, Tom Casey, said Monday when asked if harsh verbal exchanges between North and South Korea could undermine the six-nation talks on the North’s nuclear program. Since last Thursday, North Korea has taken a series of steps that experts said were aimed at shifting the blame for the impasse in the nuclear talks to Washington and pushing Mr. Lee into a tight spot. In recent days, North Korea’s navy has warned that there could be naval skirmishes, North Korean air force jets have flown close to the border before veering off and the North has threatened to turn the South into “ashes.” “North Korea is sending a warning to the United States and South Korea ahead of their summit,” said Choi Jin-wook of the Korea Institute for National Unification, which is financed by the South Korean government. “It’s the North Korean way of responding to the situation around the Korean Peninsula that is not developing in its favor.” Lee Dong-kwan, the presidential spokesman in Seoul, cautioned that South Korea was “still trying to find out what exactly the North wants or intends” with its statement on Tuesday. That comment reflected the quandary the South Korean president faces before parliamentary elections next Tuesday as his party’s candidates struggle to regain control of the National Assembly. On one hand, Mr. Lee has to live up to his election promise to get tough on the North by making South Korean economic help to the North contingent on progress in dismantling its nuclear weapons programs. On the other hand, military tensions discourage foreign investment and could deal a fatal blow to Mr. Lee’s election promise to reinvigorate the South Korean economy. After meeting Mr. Hill, however, South Korea’s nuclear envoy, Chun Yung-woo, turned up the heat on North Korea, saying that patience was wearing thin among the negotiators, who were waiting for the North to submit a complete declaration of its nuclear programs, including weapons, fissionable material and records of proliferation of technology. “There was an understanding that we have waited enough, given enough time, for North Korea to submit a nuclear declaration,” Mr. Chun told reporters, discussing  his talks with Mr. Hill.

Kurim in South Korea, a village that lost hundreds in the Korean War, has recently started a process of public reconciliation, with a joint mourning service and fund-raising for a memorial.
==::==

==::==
KURIM,South Korea— This village was once drenched with blood. Bodies of villagers shot or stabbed to death lined its lanes, and the stench of people burned alive saturated its air. What makes Kurim remarkable, however, is not the killings of about 300 people in the months surrounding the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. Eruptions of violence among  neighbors caught up in the ideological strife of the time were common in South Korea, survivors and historians say. Rather, what sets this village apart, in a nation where divisions from a war fought a half century ago still linger, is that its residents have entered a public process of reconciliation in recent years. They have held a joint mourning service for all those killed on both sides of the war’s divide and are raising money for a memorial. Government investigators cite Kurim as a possible model for healing the still-festering wounds of the war in other communities and, eventually, in  North and South Korea. “It’s time to bury the past and its vengeance,” said Choi Jae-woo, who at 85 is among the oldest residents of Kurim. “Both sides must realize we were all victims of the war. We must forgive and move on.” Kurim is a cluster of 600 households in the southwestern tip of South Korea. The ancestors of many residents settled here more than a millennium ago.   Older farmers recall  the madness of the war, when the village was gripped by terror. When Korea was divided at the end of World War II into the pro-American South and the pro-Soviet North in 1945, Kurim, like many other villages, was engulfed in bloody conflict between guerrillas who dreamed of unifying Korea under a Communist flag and pro-American government forces who pursued them into the rugged mountains. The guerrillas would come down from the hills after dark, confiscating food, killing uncooperative villagers and pressing the younger ones into joining their ranks. When day broke, the police would return, beating or executing those suspected of collaborating with the Communists. For many, “collaboration” was the only way to stay alive. But as the front lines of the war shifted, people who had lost relatives were quick to settle scores. Older residents remember with dread the “hoe squads” — villagers who attacked other villagers with farm tools or bamboo spears. On Oct. 7, 1950, while American-led United Nations forces advanced north, Communist guerrillas and leftist villagers in Kurim locked 28 people who were thought to be close to the police, including six Christians, in an inn and burned them to death. Ten days later, police officers hunting Communist sympathizers went on a rampage in Kurim, killing more than 90 people, although survivors say that leftist organizers had already fled. “They told my 17-year-old sister to take her clothes off,” said Choi Jae-sang, now 70, describing what he witnessed when he was 12. “When she balked, an officer shot her in the head with a rifle, in front of me and my parents.” A group of older villagers emerged from their homes holding South Korean flags to show that they were not Communists. “When the police called for the youngest among them, a demented man stepped forward,” Mr. Choi recalled. “An officer kicked him in the chest, sending him tumbling. Then he drove his bayonet-tipped rifle into the man’s chest, and fired.” “It was a time of utter lawlessness,” he said. Many of the police officers, who were from Kurim or nearby villages, had lost family members to the leftists. In January 1951, an army sergeant from a nearby village came to Kurim with three other soldiers, took 13 villagers to a valley and executed them to avenge the killings of his relatives by leftists. Today, on a small hill near the village entrance, there are two monuments to those burned in the inn, one built in 1976 by the county government and the other built in 2000 by Christian churches. But there is no monument to those who were killed by the police and rightist villagers. Kurim residents say that under staunchly anti-Communist past governments in South Korea, they had to lie about their relatives’ deaths. But over the past decade, two successive liberal governments have pushed for reconciliation withNorth Korea. Long before politicians began discussing national reconciliation, however, villagers in Kurim were already making their own quiet overtures. Villagers credit the survival of the traditional clan system, which has disintegrated in so many other parts of South Korea under the force of industrialization, and the leadership of the village’s four main clans with helping Kurim curb the urge for vengeance. Choi Yong-jin, 54, a Kurim native now living in Seoul, said clan elders took care to avoid provoking new violence after the war. “Old people were careful not to reveal who killed whom to their children, taking the secrets to their graves,” he said. “Once, when a young man found out and vowed revenge,” he added, “a clan elder discouraged him, reminding the young man that their own family had killed members of the other family.” Choi Jae-sang, the man who witnessed his sister’s shooting, has himself exercised self-restraint. “I think I know the police officer who killed my sister,” Mr. Choi said. “But I have never mentioned his name to anyone. He is dead now. When he was alive, he always tried to be kind to me, perhaps because of what he did to our family.” In 2006, villagers, drawing on the recollections of elders, published a 530-page history of Kurim. The publication of the book was a groundbreaking event for South Korea in that the book devoted 15 pages to the wartime killings — a subject then rarely mentioned in public and only cursorily referred to in school textbooks. Although the book lists people who were killed and how they died, it does not name perpetrators. That same year, villagers began holding joint memorial services. They have secured a plot of land and have started raising money for a joint memorial park, which they hope to complete by 2010. “I don’t see the victims as leftists or rightists,” said Choi Kyu-chul, 53, who counts his grandparents, two uncles and an aunt among the 28 people burned in the inn. But Mr. Choi has attended memorial services with those who lost relatives on the other side. “They were just victims of the tragic history of our nation,” he said.

South Korea and North Korea wrapped up high-level talks, agreeing to resume reunions of families separated by the Korean War and to test-run a cross-border train in the first half of this year. But the South said it would make a final decision on resuming humanitarian aid to the North only after Pyongyang began complying with the nuclear accord reached in the six-party talks last month and shutting down its main nuclear reactor. The North had pressed for an immediate resumption of aid during the ministerial talks, which resumed after a seven-month hiatus.

TOKYO — PresidentLee Myung-bakofSouth Koreaon Monday vowed a fearless retaliation againstNorth Koreaif attacked again, while the Japanese foreign minister said that his nation’s military ties with South Korea would slowly increase in response to the North. In a radio address, Mr. Lee said his nation would not shy away from defending itself against the North, even if it meant the possibility of war. “We have now been awakened to the realization that war can be prevented and peace assured only when such provocations are met with a strong response,” Mr. Lee said. In an interview in Tokyo, Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara of Japan said that on North Korea, his nation stood with South Korea and the United States. Tensions have remained high on the Korean Peninsula since a North Korean artillery barrage of South Korea’s Yeonpyeong Island last month, which killed four people, including two civilians. The two Koreas have intensified the war rhetoric, while the South has held a series of military drills apparently intended to show the North that it was ready to strike back forcefully if provoked again. Mr. Maehara noted that South Korea had for the first time sent military observers to joint United States-Japan military drills held near Japan earlier this month. American officials like the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, have been calling on Japan and South Korea to join three-nation military exercises with the United States. Mr. Maehara said that such military cooperation faced obstacles like Japan’s pacifist Constitution, which limits the uses of its forces, and also the “feelings” in both countries, an apparent reference to the bitter emotions in South Korea over Japan’s early-20th-century colonization. However, he characterized Japan’s relations with South Korea as “extremely good,” particularly in the area of cultural exchange, and said enhanced security links were also being talked about in the two nations. “South Korean observers participated in the joint United States-Japan exercises, and, in that sense, I think these sorts of connections and bonds will slowly appear,” said Mr. Maehara, 48, a hawkish and relatively young member of the cabinet. Even a limited raising of its military profile would represent a significant step for Japan, whose public shares a deep phobia of all things military since its devastating defeat in World War II. At the same time, Japan has also been reconsidering its defensive stance in the region, largely in response to the rise of neighboring China. Earlier this month, the Japanese Defense Ministry released new guidelines calling for shifting the focus of the Japanese military, the Self-Defense Forces, toward more mobile air and sea units that could respond to contingencies in the southern islands. This was the site of a bruising diplomatic standoff with China in September over the arrest of a Chinese trawler captain caught off islands claimed by both Japan and China. On Monday, Mr. Maehara was cautiously neutral in describing his nation’s ties with China, which in recent years has surpassed the United States as Japan’s largest trading partner. He said Japan did not seek to contain China, but he also expressed concern about a lack of transparency in China’s rapidly growing defense spending. “We want China to follow the norms of international society,” he said, “and pursue a peaceful emergence.”

PYONGYANG, North Korea —South Koreabegan  live-fire artillery exercises on Monday, escalating a  confrontation withNorth Koreaeven as an American official reported “important progress” in breaking through the North’s isolation in talks here in the North Korean capital. The South has insisted on its right to go through with the drills in disputed waters around the Yeonpyeong Island, despite threats from the North for massive military retaliation. But a few hours earlier, Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a former United States ambassador to the United Nations, said the North had agreed to concessions related to its nuclear program, a main source of tension on the peninsula. Mr. Richardson was on an unofficial trip approved by the State Department, meeting here with high ranking military officials, the North Korean vice president and members of the Foreign Ministry over five days. Mr. Richardson said the North had made two significant concessions toward reopening six-party talks on the country’s nuclear program. He said it had agreed to allow United Nations nuclear inspectors back into the Yongbyon nuclear complex to insure that it is not producing enriched uranium for a nuclear bomb. The North recently showed a Western nuclear expert a new and stunningly sophisticated facility there; it had expelled inspectors last year. The other concession was a willingness to sell 12,000 plutonium fuel rods to South Korea, removing bomb-making material from the North. “I would describe this as important progress,” Mr. Richardson said. However a spokesman for the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said the concessions had  no bearing on the South’s  drills. Last month’s hourlong bombardment was the first military attack against a civilian community since the 1950-53 Korean War, a fact that spurred a rare surge of popular demands for revenge in the South. This has put the South’s president, Lee Myung-bak, in a political bind, between public pressure to respond and the risk of escalation. A conservative who took office with pledges to be tougher on the North, Mr. Lee has been criticized for not responding militarily to the sinking of one of the South’s warships in the spring, and for the South’s relatively mild military response to the shelling. For its part, the North denies responsibility for the sinking, and maintains that the shelling of Yeonpyeong was in self-defense. It has promised to respond fiercely if the South fires into waters it claims, including those around Yeonpyeong, eight miles off its coast. Political analysts believe it has two objectives in pressing its territorial claims: to pressure the South to resumefood aidand other assistance to the North’s collapsed economy, and to burnish the military credentials of Kim Jong-un, the youngest son and now heir-apparent of the dictator Kim Jung-il. North Korea often issues bellicose warnings. But Tony Namkung, a senior adviser to Mr. Richardson, said he did not think the North was posturing. “In 20 years of following the North, I’ve never seen such unequivocal statements,” Mr. Namkung said Monday. “There is no doubt in my mind that there will be a response. The only issue is whether they will once again target civilians, or deliberately try to avoid hitting civilian targets.” On Sunday, the United Nations Security Council ended an all-day emergency session  with no statement on the situation, unable to call on the South to halt its exercises because the members could not agree on how to refer to the North’s shelling the  South Korean island. China opposed the majority of the other Security Council members over whether there would be a specific condemnation of the North. During more than six hours of talks behind closed doors, Sin Son-ho, the North Korean ambassador, warned that if war broke out it would not be limited to the peninsula and could easily spread worldwide, diplomats said. He stressed that live fire exercises near the disputed North-South maritime border were a violation of North Korean territory and called it “gangsterlike” behavior, according to diplomats in the meeting. Park In-kook, the South Korean ambassador, noted that the line had been established in 1953 and that North Korea had accepted it under a 1992 agreement, diplomats said. Russia, which called the special session, released a text noting “dangerous aggravation” on the Korean Peninsula. China endorsed that position, diplomats said, but South Korea ’s allies, including the United States and Japan, considered it a veiled criticism of Seoul ’s continued military maneuvers. “They are implying the South Koreans are doing something which they should not, while we view the drills as perfectly within their rights and something they have done countless times,” said one Western diplomat, speaking on ground rules of anonymity. The officials who met Mr. Richardson over the weekend included Maj. Gen. Pak Rim-su. He is a member of North Korea’s powerful National Defense Commission and oversees the demilitarized zone and the armistice between the two Koreas that ended the Korean War in 1953. Mr. Richardson made two proposals: a military-to-military hot line and a military commission that would include the United States, South Korea and North Korea, to monitor crises in the Yellow Sea.
