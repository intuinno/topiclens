WASHINGTON — Secretary of StateCondoleezza Ricemet with her North Korean counterpart on Wednesday for the first time, and prodded the government in Pyongyang to move quickly to dismantle its nuclear arms program. The meeting in Singapore between Ms. Rice, President Bush’s top diplomat, and Pak Ui-chun, the foreign minister of the country Mr. Bush labeled as part of the “axis of evil” in 2002, occurred with surprisingly little fanfare, given the years of buildup. Bush administration officials said Ms. Rice and Mr. Pak spoke for a few minutes after an 80-minute official conference among the United States,North Korea, Russia, China,Japanand South Korea in Singapore outside a regional meeting. In their brief one-on-one exchange, Ms. Rice told Mr. Pak that North Korea should accept terms to verify the dismantling of its nuclear weapons program, Bush administration officials said. “We didn’t get into specific timetables, but the spirit was good because people believe we have made progress,” Ms. Rice said after the talks, The Associated Press reported. “There is also a sense of urgency about moving forward and a sense that we can’t afford do have another hiatus.” She characterized the meeting as “very good,” adding that “it wasn’t a standoff with people just stating their positions,” The A.P. reported. The meeting is the latest step in the Bush administration’s turnaround on North Korea, after several years of isolation that ended in October 2006 when the North Koreans exploded a nuclear device. Ms. Rice and Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific affairs, subsequently convinced Mr. Bush that North Korea’s nuclear test had changed the rules of the game enough that the president should complete a nuclear agreement with North Korea and the four other countries at the conference, which administration officials hope will eventually make the Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons. In the accord,  North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear program, in exchange for food and fuel aid. Mr. Bush also agreed to remove it  from a list of state sponsors of terrorism. The spokesman for the North Korean delegation, Ri Tong-il, told reporters in Singapore that his country hoped that the meeting on Wednesday would build momentum toward the formal end of the Korean War. After the talks, Mr. Ri said that Mr. Pak had told his fellow foreign ministers that North Korea was willing “to implement its own obligations,” including verification, “closely following the implementation by other parties on the principle of action-for-action.”

To the Editor: Re “North Korea’s Stacked Deck” (Op-Ed, July 15): Art Brown dismisses what we have learned about North Korea’s nuclear programs and yet, based on what we do not know, criticizes the United States’ negotiations with North Korea. What he dismisses as the “creaking plutonium apparatus at Yongbyon” could have generated another five or six bombs’ worth of plutonium in the next two years, and a recently refurbished plant could have made more fuel rods to reload the reactor and generate still more plutonium. Shutting these facilities certainly does look like progress. As for North Korea’s clandestine enrichment program, how many centrifuges does it have at work enriching uranium? How long will it take for them to enrich a bomb’s worth to high levels? Were the “traces of uranium” found on documents turned over by the North highly enriched and did they originate in North Korea? We don’t know. But direct talks and inspections have revealed something important about the thousands of aluminum tubes that North Korea had acquired. As Christopher R. Hill, the United States’ top North Korea envoy, put it on Jan. 30 at Amherst College, “We’ve seen that these tubes are not being used for the centrifuge program.” As for North Korea’s stockpile of plutonium and weapons, why is Mr. Brown so sure that Kim Jong-il will keep that stockpile if the United States continues to move away from enmity? Can he read Mr. Kim’s mind? Leon V. SigalDirector, Northeast CooperativeSecurity ProjectSocial Science Research CouncilNew York, July 15, 2008

On Israel and North Korea, President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice are positively Clintonian.
==::==

Washington NEITHER George W. Bush nor the national security expert who advised him through his first presidential campaign seemed captivated by the prospect of a Nobel Peace Prize or encomiums from the chattering classes. But something has happened over the last seven years. The allure of a place in history has grown. How else to explain the about-face President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice have made on key foreign policy issues from North Korea to the Middle East peace process? Early in his term, President Bush jettisoned the crown jewels of the Clinton administration’s foreign policy — the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and the North Korea Agreed Framework. In each case, experts still disagree about whether he was right to do so. But the fact is that Bill Clinton had gone the extra mile in the Middle East and achieved nothing. And revelations that the North Koreans had been cheating on their 1994 commitment to abandon nuclear weapons made manifest the fraud underlying that “breakthrough.” Seven years into the Bush presidency, however, what was old is new again. The “blackmailing” Pyongyang regime  is now one with which the United States can do business. Nevermind that in 2002, American and Spanish warships discovered a North Korean vessel carrying Scud missiles to Yemen or that in 2005 the Treasury Department designated the Macao-based Banco Delta Asia as a “primary money-laundering concern” for its role in North Korea’s illegal weapons, counterfeiting and drug businesses. Now suddenly, Washington eschews comment on North Korean arms sales. And as for Banco Delta Asia, it’s back in business and its frozen money has been returned to North Korea. Worse, Ms. Rice has now signed on to a new “Mark II” version of the agreed framework, which has considerably fewer benchmarks for the North Koreans than the Clinton administration deal did. Ostensibly a commitment by North Korea to disclose and abandon all nuclear programs — including a secret highly enriched uranium program — the deal’s vague, open-ended nature promises endless renegotiation. As to why an administration that once insisted upon “complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement” is now O.K. with nebulous “abandonment,” the record is silent. Back in 2001, the newly minted Bush administration was scornful of Bill Clinton’s efforts to build a Palestinian state with a terrorist government in place. Mr. Bush refused to allow Yasir Arafat to darken the White House door and said he would “not support the establishment of a Palestinian state until its leaders engage in a sustained fight against the terrorists.” Now Hamas is in control of Gaza, Mahmoud Abbas is the powerless president of a Palestinian Authority and members of his Fatah forces tried to assassinate Israel’s prime minister. Nonetheless, Ms. Rice has been to the region repeatedly and recently sought advice from not just Bill Clinton but, of all people, Jimmy Carter. Next week, she’ll be playing host to Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel and his Palestinian antagonists at a cozy chat session in Annapolis, Md. (None seem as committed to the meeting as Ms. Rice — originally expected to last three days, it has reportedly been pared down to one.) The clearest sign of Ms. Rice’s eagerness to make deals with Pyongyang and the Palestinians is her willingness to overlook egregious misbehavior by her negotiating partners. Much like the Clinton administration, which disregarded early warning of a uranium enrichment program in hopes of staging a “historic” presidential visit to Pyongyang in 2000, the United States is now ignoring evidence of North Korean nuclear and missile proliferation to the Middle East. For example,  in September Israeli jets  destroyed what Israeli and American intelligence assessed to be a North Korean-built nuclear reactor in Syria. Officials who have seen the intelligence tell me the structure was the result of several years of transfers between North Korean nuclear suppliers and Syrian buyers. Ms. Rice’s most revealing comment? An explanation that “issues of proliferation do not affect the Palestinian-Israeli peace efforts we are making.” This bizarre rationalization is oddly divorced from reality: how could Israel possibly be indifferent to its neighbors acquiring nuclear technology from America’s partner in the new agreed framework? The statement simply invites America’s adversaries to capitalize on the administration’s desperation. Why not engage in bad behavior if the Bush administration, like the Clinton administration, will look the other way? By kowtowing to the conventional wisdom of what a secretary of state should do, Condoleezza Rice is making her legacy dependent on the future behavior of a North Korean tyrant and Palestinian pretenders. Ultimately, that will serve neither selfish nor national interests.

Whether Syria is starting a nuclear program, as Israel may believe, is a difficult question for U.S. spy agencies.
==::==
2007-09-22T00:00:00Z
==::==
WASHINGTON, Sept. 21 — American concerns about ties betweenSyriaandNorth Koreahave long focused on a partnership involving missiles and missile technology. Even many hawks within the Bush administration have expressed doubts that the Syrians have the money or technical depth to build a serious nuclear program like the one in Iran. But the Sept. 6 Israeli airstrike inside Syria has reignited debate over whether the Syrians are trying to overcome past obstacles by starting their own small nuclear program, or by trying to buy nuclear components from an outside supplier. It is a particularly difficult question for American spy agencies, which are still smarting from the huge prewar misjudgments made about the status of Iraq’s weapons programs. American officials are now sorting through what they say areIsrael’s private claims that what their jets struck was tied to nuclear weapons  development, not merely to missile production. So far, American officials have been extremely cautious about endorsing the Israeli conclusion. Syria’s efforts to bolster its missile arsenal have been a source of worry for Israel for years, especially given Syria’s track record of arming Hezbollah fighters when they clash with Israeli troops. During the summer of 2006, Hezbollah, the militant Shiite group, fired hundreds of missiles at targets inside Israel from Lebanon, surprising Israeli officials with the sophistication of its arsenal. And North Korean engineers are long believed to have helped Syria develop a sophisticated class of Scud missiles that have a longer range and are more accurate than earlier versions. According toGlobalSecurity.org, a defense research organization, North Korea has helped Syria develop the Scud-D missile, with a range of about 435 miles. Whether Syria is actively pursuing a nuclear program has been the subject of fierce debate in Washington for several years. The dispute was at the center of the fight in 2005 over the nomination of John R. Bolton to become ambassador to the United Nations. At the time, several intelligence officials said they had clashed in 2002 and 2003 with Mr. Bolton, then an under secretary of state, about the extent of Syria’s unconventional weapons programs. According to the officials, Mr. Bolton wanted to include information in a public speech about a Syrian nuclear program that could not be corroborated by intelligence agencies. In recent interviews, Mr. Bolton has suggested that the Israeli strike may have partly vindicated his view. Yet that is hard to assess, since whatever information a few senior officials in Washington and Jerusalem possess has been so restricted that two senior Asian diplomats, representing close American allies who are frequently updated on North Korea, said late this week that they had received no useful information from their American counterparts. On Thursday, President Bush declined three times to shed any light on the Israeli strike, although he did repeat a warning to North Korea. It is unclear to what extent the secrecy about the Israeli strike has been motivated by American doubts about the intelligence or by an effort to protect sources and classified information. But American officials are now looking at the possibility that the Syrians saw an opportunity to buy some of the basic components of a nuclear program on the cheap, perhaps because North Korea is trying to get elements of its nuclear program out of the country to meet deadlines in a precarious denuclearization agreement with Washington. American officials are also studying at least two technology trade agreements between Syria and North Korea that were signed over the summer, trying to determine whether the arrangements may be designed for nascent nuclear cooperation between the two countries. “One has to balance the skepticism that the Syrians can build an indigenous nuclear program with the very sobering assessment that North Korea is the world’s No. 1 proliferator and a country willing to sell whatever it possesses,” said a former senior Bush administration official who once had full access to the intelligence about both countries, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was discussing intelligence assessments. Though it has long sold its missile technology — to Syria, Iran, Pakistan and other customers — North Korea has never been known to export nuclear technology or material. Last Oct. 9, hours after the North tested its first nuclear device, Mr. Bush went in front of cameras in the White House to issue the North a specific warning that “the transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states or nonstate entities would be considered a grave threat to the United States, and we would hold North Korea fully accountable of the consequences of such action.” His declaration that day had been urged for years by hard-liners in the administration who believed that the United States had never been explicit enough with North Korea. They saw their opportunity after the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, ignored pressure from China, South Korea, Russia and others and conducted its test. Even though the Israelis are whispering that there was a nuclear connection to the Sept. 6 attack, so far there has been no hard evidence that the North has ever tried to sell elements of its two nuclear programs. One of those programs, involving plutonium, is quite advanced, enough to produce six to a dozen nuclear weapons. But selling that fuel would be enormously risky, and perhaps easily detectable. The other program, based on uranium-enrichment equipment believed to have been bought from the network created by Abdul Qadeer Khan, the Pakistani nuclear engineer, is assessed to be in its very early stages, and some doubt the North Koreans ever made much progress on it at all. That program involves the construction of centrifuges to enrich uranium, the path that Iran is taking. But it is complex, expensive and hard to hide, and many experts believe it is beyond Syria’s capabilities or budget. Syria does have one very small research reactor, which is Chinese built. But it was described in a 2004 Swedish defense research agency report as “the smallest on the world market and incapable of military applications.” John Pike of GlobalSecurity.org said that, given its neighborhood, Syria might be interested in a nuclear deterrent, but that he was highly skeptical that Damascus could at this point have developed anything that would pose a significant risk to Israel. “Any country in the region that was not at least learning what it would take to develop a nuclear program is asleep at the switch,” he said. “But the proposition that there is anything sufficiently mature to warrant bombing is difficult to believe.”

The cabinet approved a list of 24 luxury goods embargoed for export to North Korea, a move intended for North Korea’s ruling elite. Included are cars, jewelry, watches, cigarettes, fountain pens, perfume, musical instruments, audiovisual equipment, caviar and liquor. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, has long been known for his fondness for cognac. Intelligence officials familiar with his habits say the biggest gifts for top North Korean cadres are cars. Pianos and camcorders are also popular. “I hope the ban will be effective as a strong message from the international community to the leaders of North Korea’s government and party,” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said.

Aijalon Mahli Gomes reunited with his family in Boston a day after former President Jimmy Carter secured his release from North Korea.
==::==
2010-08-28T00:00:00Z
==::==
BOSTON — The stepfather of Aijalon Mahli Gomes, the American who arrived home Friday after being held for months inNorth Korea, said the family had been praying for some high-profile help when former PresidentJimmy Cartercalled unexpectedly last week. “I kept saying, ‘That’s going to have to happen to get him out,’ ” said the stepfather, Milton McCarthy, outside the family’s home in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston. “But we don’t know anybody like that. But then we got the call from former President Carter and it was like, ‘He’s going to come home.’ ” Mr. Gomes, 31, stepped off a private plane at Logan International Airport  about 2 p.m. on Friday, a day after Mr. Carter secured his release in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. He wasimmediately surrounded by more than a dozen relativeswho enveloped him in a group hug. Neither Mr. Gomes (pronounced GOHMZ) nor Mr. Carter spoke with reporters upon their arrival, and it was unclear if or when either man would share details of Mr. Gomes’s detainment and release. Mr. Gomes quickly left the airport with his family and stayed out of the public eye for the rest of the day. But Mr. McCarthy later said that Mr. Gomes appeared in good health and that Mr. Carter had told the family that “the Koreans had taken good care of him.” In a written statement, the family thanked Mr. Carter and others involved in his release — including the State Department and Swedish diplomats in Pyongyang — and asked for privacy. “This has been a long, dark and difficult period for Aijalon and our family,” the statement said. “For Aijalon, although returning home, the journey toward healing really just begins today.” Mr. Carter had traveled to Pyongyang on a private humanitarian mission to win the release of Mr. Gomes, who was sentenced in April to eight years in a North Korean prison and was fined $700,000 for entering the country illegally. Mr. Carter, who arrived in Pyongyang on Wednesday at the invitation of the North Korean government, did not appear to meet with Kim Jong-il, the country’s leader. Speaking of Mr. Kim, Mr. McCarthy said: “He wants to feel validated. He does things or he won’t do things unless he gets a photo op with someone in a high office.” The choice of Mr. Carter to go to Pyongyang was weeks in the making, said a person briefed on the process, and reflected a complex set of considerations for the Obama administration. Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico had both volunteered to go, and each had a credible reason: Mr. Kerry because Mr. Gomes is his constituent; Mr. Richardson because he has carried out these rescue missions before. But Mr. Carter was the administration’s preferred choice, this person said, in part because he was not a current official, and therefore would send less of a signal to the North Korean regime. Mr. Carter was also able to obtain assurances from Pyongyang that if he went, he would win the release of Mr. Gomes. Mr. Carter has a track record with North Korea, having gone there in 1994 on behalf of the Clinton administration to help defuse a crisis with Mr. Kim’s father, Kim Il-sung. Aides to Mr. Kerry said Friday that they had kept Mr. Gomes’s family updated on efforts to free him over the nearly eight months since his arrest and had negotiated with officials at the North Korean mission to the United Nations in March. Swedish diplomats in Pyongyang met with Mr. Gomes several times during his detention, the aides said, bringing him toiletries, reading material and word from his family. Frederick Jones, a spokesman for Mr. Kerry, said Mr. Gomes appeared to have been held at multiple locations during his detention. Mr. Gomes, who graduated from Bowdoin College in 2001, went to South Korea about three years ago to teach English. He appears to have entered North Korea in support of Robert Park, an American   who went there in December to call attention to the dismal conditions in the North’s prison camps. Mr. Park was freed in February. North Korea said last month that Mr. Gomes tried to kill himself out of “frustration with the U.S. government’s failure to free him.” But Mr. Gomes’s uncle, Michael Farrow, said Mr. Gomes had in fact been on ahunger strike. “I wouldn’t say that he was anywhere near sick at all,” Mr. Farrow said. “Naturally he probably had some discomfort of being away from home, but other than that he held up pretty good.”

China called its behavior “beyond reproach,” continuing an argument with the U.S. about how to handle North Korea.
==::==

==::==
BEIJING — Three days after President Obama emerged from a tense meeting with President Hu Jintao ofChina, and accused Beijing of “willful blindness” towardNorth Korea’s military provocations, the Chinese government on Tuesday continued the argument about how to handle its testy neighbor. In a regularly scheduled news conference, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry dismissed American calls for a tough line against North Korea, most recently for the sinking of a South Korean naval ship. The spokesman, Qin Gang, suggested that Mr. Obama had overreached when he accused Beijing of “turning a blind eye” to what an international investigation concluded was a North Korean torpedo attack in March on the ship. The sinking of theCheonan, which killed 46 South Korean sailors, has intensified already strained relations between the North and the South and thrown into stark relief China’s long-standing role as a patron of Kim Jong-il, the North Korean leader. Mr. Qin contended that China had even more reason than the United States to view the sinking with gravity. “China is a neighbor of the Korean Peninsula, and on this issue our feelings differ from a country that lies 8,000 kilometers distant,” he said. “We feel even more direct and serious concerns.” United States officials indicated that Mr. Obama was likely to continue trying to step up pressure on China and North Korea, including authorizing new military exercises with South Korea that would take place not far from Chinese waters. Mr. Obama’s strategy appears intended to demonstrate to China that it would pay a price for failing to rein in the North Koreans, who depend on China for food and fuel. On Saturday, Mr. Obama announced that the United States would extend by three years, until 2015, an agreement under which American commanders would take control of South Korean forces in the event of a military clash with the North. When United States officials first briefed reporters on the meeting between Mr. Obama and Mr. Hu on Saturday during the Group of 20 summit meeting in Toronto, they described a largely friendly session that covered economic and security issues. But in recent days, American officials have acknowledged that the conversation took a decidedly tougher turn when it came to North Korea, and that Mr. Obama emerged from the meeting frustrated at Mr. Hu’s unwillingness to acknowledge the North’s actions, much less put additional pressure on the country. The dispute is playing out now in the United Nations. A watered-down “president’s statement” is under debate in the Security Council that would acknowledge the findings of a South Korean-led investigation, which included experts from four other countries, that concluded that a North Korean submarine sank the ship. China has led the opposition to the statement and to the idea that the North would have to pay any price for the act of aggression, which some American officials say was essentially an act of war. An American official familiar with the conversation between Mr. Obama and Mr. Hu said that the discussion of the sinking  was “the toughest part of a generally positive” talk. Mr. Hu spoke only in generalities to Mr. Obama about the need for “peace and stability” on the Korean Peninsula, the official said. Those are traditional code words for doing nothing that could result in the collapse of the North Korean government,  which could result in a flood of refugees into China and might eliminate China’s buffer with American forces in the South. Mr. Obama responded that the North Koreans should not be “indulged” for acts of aggression, the official said, and he said that if China were truly interested in preventing the outbreak of hostilities in its region, it would take a much tougher line. It was at a news conference a short time later that Mr. Obama said “willful blindness” would not solve the problem. North Korea has denied the accusations that it sank the Cheonan and has warned that any attempt to punish it would lead to armed conflict. The director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Leon E. Panetta, said Sunday that he believed that the sinking of the Cheonan was part of a succession struggle in North Korea, as President Kim’s youngest son, Kim Jong-un, 27, is being positioned as his successor.

A large shipment of North Korean weapons seized in Bangkok in December was bound for an airport in Iran, according to a Thai government report.

BANGKOK — A large shipment of North Korean weapons seized here in December was bound for an airport in Iran, according to a Thai government report submitted to the United Nations and leaked to news agencies. But a Thai government spokesman in Bangkok said the report, which was prepared by the Thai Foreign Ministry, was not conclusive because investigations were continuing. Since a Russian-made aircraft landed in Bangkok on Dec. 11 laden with rockets, fuses, rocket-propelled grenades and what appeared to be missile parts, reports of where the aircraft was headed and who ordered the weapons have been sketchy and contradictory. “We don’t know exactly where the plane was going,” Panitan Wattanayagorn, the Thai government spokesman, said in a telephone interview Sunday. The flight plan submitted by the crew of the aircraft listed several other airports, Mr. Panitan said. “The cargo could have been offloaded at any of those destinations.” Diplomats and Thai government officials appear to agree that the weapons were manufactured and shipped from North Korea in violation of a U.N. arms embargo. There also appears to be agreement that the Thai authorities searched the aircraft on a tip-off by American intelligence agencies. The crew members, who are being detained at a Bangkok prison, say they were told that they were carrying oil-drilling equipment. Numerous versions of airway bills and itineraries are circulating with little certainty as to which are authentic. The Thai lawyer for the crew, Somsak Saithong, said Sunday that the crew gave him an airway bill that says the weapons were ordered by an Iranian company. This appears to contradict other documents that list companies in Ukraine and Hong Kong. According to Bloomberg News, which obtained a copy of the Thai government report, the cargo was destined for Mahrabad Airport in Tehran. The shipper was listed as Korea Mechanical Industry Co. A U.N. Security Council committee is assessing the Thai report and is drafting letters that will be sent to North Korea and other governments requesting further information, according to the diplomats quoted by Bloomberg. The committee will report on the case to the full Security Council on Feb. 11. The Security Council voted in June to punish North Korea for a second nuclear test conducted in May. The U.N. sanctions allow for inspections of cargo to and from North Korea and other restrictions. Since the 1970s, the North Korean government has been accused of condoning, and even encouraging, its agencies to bring in badly needed hard currency through criminal activities, such as counterfeiting dollars and cigarettes, as well as selling weapons. Revenues from illicit activities and sales of weapons are estimated to cover a large portion of North Korea’s annual trade deficit, which was estimated at $1.5 billion in 2008 by the South Korean government. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, is said to use proceeds funneled to his private coffers to buy the loyalty of elites as well as finance his nuclear and missile projects. The main clients of North Korean weapons are countries in the Middle East, especially Iran and Syria. Last August, the United Arab Emirates seized a ship carrying North Korean weapons that were bound for Iran in violation of the U.N. embargo. The weapons seized reportedly included rocket launchers, detonators, munitions and ammunition for rocket-propelled grenades.

A Stockholm department store has removed a new line of North Korean-made designer jeans from its shelves, saying it wanted to avoid courting controversy with ties with the communist nation. The PUB department store’s management had not been informed that the jeans would be carried in its space, and it pulled the plug when it became aware of it, Rene Stephansen, the store’s director, said Saturday. “For us, this is not a question of Noko Jeans — this is a question about a political issue that PUB doesn’t want to be associated with,” he said. “This is not the forum for the discussion” of North Korea. The Noko Jeans line was the brainchild of three Swedish entrepreneurs who hoped their label would help break North Korea’s isolation through increased trade with the West. The jeans come only in black, partly because blue ones are associated with the United States and are banned in North Korea. The jeans were to be sold at Aplace, a retail space within the department store. Mr. Stephansen said he had informed the shop’s owner of the decision just before the planned launch. A spokesman for Aplace called the decision “a bit cowardly” but said that he understood the department store’s point of view. “It’s a real shame,” Kalle Tollmar said. “But we will continue to sell them on our Web site, and Noko Jeans will continue to sell them on theirs.” Jeans have been banned in North Korea for years because they are considered a symbol of U.S. imperialism, said Choi Eun-suk, a professor of North Korean legal affairs at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies at Kyungnam University in Seoul. In 2005, the regime urged women to refrain from wearing trousers, saying Western clothing dampened revolutionary spirit and blurred national pride. The jeans  cost 1,500 kronor, or about $220. They are cut and trimmed by workers in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, while material, buttons and zippers are supplied from other countries.

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton called the U.S. alliance with Japan a “cornerstone” of American foreign policy.

TOKYO — In words and gestures, Secretary of StateHillary Rodham Clintonoffered reassurance toJapanon Tuesday, calling its alliance with the United States a “cornerstone” of American foreign policy and meeting with families of Japanese citizens abducted byNorth Korea. Mrs. Clinton then departed on Wednesday for Jakarta, Indonesia, the second stop on a four-country tour that includes stops in South Korea and China. As with the stopover in Japan, the visit to Indonesia is steeped in symbolism: it is the first Muslim country she will visit and the start of what she said would be a “concerted effort” by the Obama administration to bring a new message to the Islamic world. Mrs. Clinton may also lay the groundwork for a visit by President Obama, who lived in Jakarta as a boy. She has told colleagues that she is fascinated by Indonesia’s ability to achieve political stability after its economic crisis in the late 1990s,  and that she  wonders if it holds any lessons for Pakistan. While in Japan, Mrs. Clinton carried an invitation from Mr. Obama to Prime Minister Taro Aso to meet him in Washington next Tuesday. Mr. Aso will be the first foreign leader received at the  Obama White House. Saber-rattling by North Korea has already cast a shadow over Mrs. Clinton’s first trip as secretary of state, forcing her to confront an issue that evokes a complex range of feelings among the North’s neighbors. In Japan, where animosity toward North Korea runs deep because of the plight of the abductees, Mrs. Clinton said she met with the families “to express my personal sympathy and our concern for what happened.” During the meeting, several family members said, Mrs. Clinton pledged her support for resolving questions about the abductees — the fate of many of whom remains unknown even after three decades. But she stopped short of promising concrete steps to press North Korea on the issue. The relatives said that Mrs. Clinton spent most of the 30-minute meeting listening to their accounts. Sakie Yokota, whose daughter, Megumi, was kidnapped from Japan in 1977 at age 13, said she gave Mrs. Clinton a copy of her book about her daughter and an extra copy for Mr. Obama. “She is also a mother, and she said that any mother would fight to the end if such a thing happened to her,” Mrs. Yokota said. But when she asked Mrs. Clinton to punish North Korea by restoring it to Washington’s list of state sponsors of terrorism — it was removed by the Bush administration last year — Mrs. Clinton was noncommittal, saying only that she “would think about it,” Mrs. Yokota said. The relatives said it was noteworthy that Mrs. Clinton had met them, saying it sent a signal to North Korea not to ignore the issue. But they also showed disappointment in her offer to normalize relations with North Korea if it abandoned its nuclear program. Shigeo Izuka, whose sister was kidnapped in 1978, said he implored Mrs. Clinton “not to become friendly with North Korea because of a nuclear agreement.” He said she listened to him “with intense concern in her eyes, but I felt in my heart that this issue will be all too easily forgotten.” North Korea has admitted to abducting Mrs. Yokota’s daughter and Mr. Izuka’s sister and says that both later died in North Korea. The families reject the North’s account, saying they want a full investigation. Mrs. Clinton said Washington would not relent in its pressure on North Korea to get it to give up its nuclear weapons program in a way that  was verifiable. “We are watching very closely,” she said. But she repeated Mr. Obama’s pledge to “reach out a hand to those with which we have differences.” And she committed to continuing the multiparty talks with the North Korean government that also involve China, Japan, Russia and South Korea. Mrs. Clinton’s busy day also included afternoon tea with Empress Michiko at the imperial residence and a town hall meeting at Tokyo University. Fielding a question from a student about American economic sanctions against Myanmar, formerly Burma, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged that the policy had not brought any significant changes to the country, which is ruled by a military junta. She said the Obama administration was reviewing its options, although she did not give details. Mrs. Clinton had dinner with Prime Minister Aso, followed by a meeting with his political nemesis, Ichiro Ozawa, the leader of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan. After the meeting, Mr. Ozawa said that he told Mrs. Clinton that he valued the alliance with the United States, but that he emphasized that he wanted the relationship to be on a more equal footing, criticizing the current government for following Washington too slavishly.

Abdul Qadeer Khan, the architect of Pakistan’s nuclear program, said that his country gave centrifuges to North Korea in a 2000 shipment supervised by the army.

ISLAMABAD,Pakistan(AP) — Pakistan gave centrifuges toNorth Koreain a 2000 shipment supervised by the army,Abdul Qadeer Khan, the architect of Pakistan’s nuclear program, said on Friday. Dr. Khan said in a telephone interview that the uranium enrichment equipment was sent from Pakistan in a North Korean plane loaded under the supervision of Pakistani security officials. His claims stood in stark contrast with his 2004 confession that he was solely responsible for spreading nuclear technology to Iran, North Korea and Libya. But Dr. Khan has since renounced that confession, saying he made it to avoid implicating other Pakistani officials. The Pakistani government, however, has repeatedly denied that its officials, or the army, knew about Dr. Khan’s nuclear proliferation activities. Dr. Khan said that the army had “complete knowledge” of the shipment of used P-1 centrifuges to North Korea. “It must have gone with his consent,” he said, referring to Pervez Musharraf, who was the army chief and in control of the government at the time of the shipment. Dr. Khan’s accusations could prove embarrassing for the army and for Mr. Musharraf, who is now the president and a main ally in American efforts against terrorism. Army and Foreign Ministry spokesmen declined to comment on Friday. But Mr. Musharraf’s spokesman, Rashid Qureshi, rejected Dr. Khan’s claims. “I can say with full confidence that it is all lies and false statements,” he said. Many Pakistanis regard Dr. Khan as a hero for his role in the program that gave Pakistan the Islamic world’s first nuclear weapon in 1998, seen as a deterrent against the country’s historical archrival, India. After his 2004 confession and televised statement of contrition, Dr. Khan was pardoned by Mr. Musharraf but has been kept under house arrest at his villa in Islamabad. Since a new civilian government took power after the elections in February, eclipsing Mr. Musharraf, Dr. Khan has increasingly spoken out in the news media. Asked why he had taken sole responsibility for the nuclear proliferation, Dr. Khan said friends, including a central figure in the ruling party at the time, had persuaded him that it was in the national interest. Dr. Khan said that in return he had been promised complete freedom. Dr. Khan also said that he had traveled to North Korea in 1999 with a Pakistani Army general to buy shoulder-launched missiles from the government there. Also on Friday, a lawyer for Dr. Khan said listening devices had been planted in the scientist’s tightly guarded home. Earlier this week, Dr. Khan’s wife petitioned the Islamabad High Court to end the restrictions on her husband’s movements and to allow him more freedom to speak to the news media.

A 70-year-old German woman came to South Korea this week with a tragic personal love story that is resonating with many people on this divided peninsula.

SEOUL, South Korea, Aug. 22 — Koreans have long looked toGermanyfor similarities between the nations’ histories. Both countries have been scarred by war and separation. This week, a 70-year-old German woman came to South Korea with a tragic personal love story that is resonating with many people on this divided peninsula. “He was my first love,” Renate Hong says of the North Korean husband she last saw 46 years ago, when they lived together in East Germany. “And he should be the last love in my life,” she says. Ms. Hong arrived in Seoul this week on a 10-day visit seeking a reunion with her husband, Hong Ok-geun. The German Red Cross has said that Mr. Hong is still alive and living inNorth Korea. The citizens of North Korea are allowed little if any contact with the wider world. For now, South Korea is as close as she can get to him. Almost 20 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall removed one barrier between them, the Korean divide remains. Ms. Hong planned to deliver a petition Thursday to the South Korean president, Roh Moo-hyun, who is scheduled to meet with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, in October. The petition asks Mr. Roh to mention her case during his meeting in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. She also wants him to discuss the cases of other German women who are longing for word about their North Korean husbands. “I know that I don’t have a future with him, since he has another family in the North,” she said of her husband. “I want to at least meet him to talk about our lives of all these years. I want our sons to meet their father, of whom they have no memory, and hear what a great time their parents had once had together.” Renate Kleinle, as she was then called, and Hong Ok-geun met in 1955, when they were students at Friedrich Schiller University in Jena, 140 miles southwest of Berlin. They attended the same freshman chemistry class. Renate, a shy 18-year-old, was curious about the exchange students from North Korea, East Germany’s Communist ally, who sat together at the front of the classroom. She was especially interested in Mr. Hong, a funny 21-year-old who was fluent in German. Later, she said, he courted her at a party with wonderful waltz steps. “It was really his eyes that caught my heart,” she said in an interview. “I still see those eyes when I think about him.” They married in February 1960, in a small town where the local authorities were unaware that marriages of North Korean students to East Germans were frowned on by both governments. There were no guests. Four months later, their first son, Peter Hyon-chol Hong, was born. North Korean students were under constant surveillance, she said. Even after they were married, her husband had to return each night to the dormitory where the 12 North Korean students in Jena lived. The couple’s happy time came to an abrupt halt in April 1961. The North Korean government recalled all 350 of its students after several defected to the West. The students were given 48 hours to pack and report to the North Korean Embassy in Berlin. Several students’ wives followed their husbands to North Korea. (All, it is believed, eventually returned, having failed to adapt to life there.) Ms. Hong, five months pregnant with their second son, was too weak for the two-week train ride. “My husband said he must return to the North but did not explain why,” she said. “He was holding our 10-month-old baby, and I had never seen him crying so much. I felt helpless, but I hoped that our separation would be only temporary.” Over the next two years, he sent her more than 50 letters. In a letter dated Feb. 26, 1963, he asked whether Uwe, the son he had never seen, could stand up. Then he said: “This sounds like a real goodbye letter.” No more letters came. Her letters to him were returned as undeliverable. Ms. Hong appealed to the North Korean Embassy to allow her husband to return to Germany. But the embassy said North Korea, desperate to rebuild its economy after the Korean War, could not “give up even a single citizen” and asked for her “understanding.” Ms. Hong raised their two sons in Jena, working for 10 years as a chemistry teacher, then as a chemist at a pharmaceutical company until she retired in 1997. Their son, Peter, grew up to become a dairy farmer. Uwe, like his parents, is a chemist. “I did not remarry because I didn’t want my children to have a stepfather,” Ms. Hong said. In 1989, a former North Korean student on a business trip to East Germany came to see Ms. Hong in Jena. He said her husband was well but said little more. Her hopes for seeing him again soared after the two Koreas held their first summit meeting in 2000, and after North Korea opened diplomatic ties with the unified Germany in 2001. Last year she began appealing for help from the German government and Red Cross societies in Germany and South Korea. Early this year, the German Red Cross said Mr. Hong was retired and living with his family in North Korea. During her stay in Seoul, Ms. Hong said she would seek the advice of South Korean Red Cross about family reunions. Since the meeting between the Koreas in 2000, the Red Cross has arranged thousands of reunions of family members who were separated after the Korean War more than half a century ago. Over the years Ms. Hong has compiled three albums of photographs of her two sons, hoping that one day Mr. Hong will be able to leaf through them. Her memorabilia from their time together includes a dried flower petal he sent with a letter and a dog-eared notebook she once used to practice common Korean expressions. One of the phrases is “dasi bobsida,” which means, “I hope to see you again.” That is the expression she says she would use if she were allowed to see her husband again, however briefly.

When the inside history of the Bush team is written, we will discover that it has been one of the most internally divided administrations — ever.
==::==

Watching the Bush team wrestle with Iran, North Korea and Iraq reminds me of something that used to be said of the Reagan administration: The right hand never knew what the far right hand was doing. In fact, my bet is that when the inside history of the Bush team is written, we will discover that, contrary to its carefully managed image of a disciplined core operating from consistent, conservative principles, it has actually been one of the most internally divided administrations — ever. The only thing the Bush folks all agreed on was that they would never do anything Bill Clinton did. Beyond that, it’s been a food fight. The trial of Scooter Libby, with its testimony about wars between the V.P.’s office and the White House, the White House and the C.I.A., and everyone against the State Department, proves that beyond a reasonable doubt. When the former Bush U.N. ambassador John Bolton trashed the president’s recent deal with North Korea as a “charade,” though, he highlighted the biggest internal division of all within the Bush team: how to deal with rogue regimes like Iran, North Korea and Saddam’s Iraq — whether to go for regime change or behavior change. On Iran and North Korea, “this administration does not have clear policies, it has competing impulses,” said Robert Litwak of the Wilson Center, who just published a smart book on this theme: “Regime Change: U.S. Strategy Through the Prism of 9/11.” “The administration’s mantra is ‘all options are on the table.’ But the dilemma is that too many objectives are on the table as well.” Because this administration was divided for so long on Iran and North Korea, over regime change or behavior change, it got neither. All it got was that Iran and North Korea both went out and bought Bush insurance: a nuclear weapons program. President Bush obviously recognizes that and is now trying to remedy it. Bill Clinton was criticized for taking more golf mulligans — do-overs — than any other president. Mr. Bush will be remembered for taking more foreign policy mulligans than any other president. On North Korea, the president has finally decided to focus purely on changing behavior. He struck a very sensible deal last week with Kim Jong Il to take his country off our terrorism list and normalize relations, provided Mr. Kim gives up his nukes. But we could have had a similar deal years ago — when North Korea had only two nukes — had the Bush team not been wrangling with itself over regime change or behavior change. While it wrangled, Mr. Kim built up his nuclear arsenal, adding six to 12 more bombs. If this deal is carried out, which is still uncertain, the wasted years will not have been a disaster. If it isn’t carried out, they will have been very costly. Why do you think that a year after Mr. Bush told us we were “addicted to oil” we still have no serious plan to end that addiction? Because the market fundamentalists in his White House — led by Dick Cheney, who opposes any government effort to impose carbon caps or taxes to promote alternative energies, à la California — keep blocking the market pragmatists who do. And Mr. Bush won’t intervene. The irony of Iraq is that it’s the one place where Mr. Bush decisively chose regime change, but he then executed it so poorly, with insufficient troops, that Iraq never stood a chance. If Don Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney had spent as much time plotting the toppling of Saddam Hussein as they did the toppling of Colin Powell, Iraq today would be Switzerland. Today’s Bush troop surge in Iraq is just another mulligan — the president’s trying to do in 2007 what he should have done in 2003. In between, we’ve paid a huge price. How about we avoid a mulligan on Iran? Let’s put a clear deal on the table: full diplomatic relations, security guarantees and thousands of student visas if Iran puts its nuclear program under U.N. inspection and stops supporting terrorism. If not: more sanctions and isolation. Such an offer would at least get us some leverage, unite us more with our allies outside Iran, energize our allies inside Iran and force some excruciating choices on Iran’s leaders. “Resolving the contradiction in Washington will sharpen the contradiction in Tehran,” Mr. Litwak argued. “Taking regime change off the table in America will put behavior change on the table in Iran.” I guess we should be thankful that Mr. Bush is trying to fix some of his mistakes, but we have paid a huge, unnecessary price for his learning curve. Which is why it’s always best to get it right the first time. The best golfers never take mulligans, and the best presidents never need them.

The best the West can hope for is that Beijing will convince Pyongyang to behave in a responsible manner.

The U.S. request for China’s support to sanction North Korea for purportedly torpedoing the Cheonan will likely be met with, at most, a lukewarm response. China has predictably called for restraint while North Korea denies any involvement in the sinking of the South Korean vessel, although an international investigation implicates the North. But now that Seoul has cut off all trade, exchanges and aid to the North, there is significant pressure on Beijing to take concrete action. China is not indifferent to what is now characterized as the worst attack since the 1953 armistice ended the Korean War. Yet China is and has been going down a path different from what the West is prepared for, and the message from Beijing is that it will stay with carrots rather than sticks. The  best the West can hope for is that the Chinese will coax Pyongyang into behaving in a responsible manner.  That may be  unsatisfactory for the West, but it is altogether consistent with Beijing’s long-term interests. While the visit by North Korean leader Kim Jong-il to China in early May was driven by an immediate need for aid and investment, Kim spent much time taking lessons from the Chinese by touring the coastal cities of Dalian and Tianjin, which the hosts promoted as models of economic growth and development. The message was that what worked for China might work for North Korea. Participating in the entourage was Jang Song-thaek, Kim’s brother-in-law and chief of foreign investment, and Kim Yang-gon, the head of Korea Taepung International Investment Group, which is an agency created this year to channel $10 billion from China to build ports, roads, railways and tourist infrastructure. This huge investment amounts to almost 70 percent of North Korea’s domestic gross product. Later this year, it is anticipated that foreign investment (primarily from China) will be allowed in eight major cities of North Korea, and not just in state-sponsored foreign economic zones. China hopes to use its economic power to encourage Pyongyang to return to the stalled six-party nuclear talks and to temper its actions. Beyond that, Beijing is not likely to publicly chastise the Kim regime. The end result  is that the Kim family’s  power base is strengthened. China’s priority in its relations with North Korea is stability, since the collapse of the North could result in a flood of refugees into China. China is also wary that an abrupt change of regime would improve chances for unification with the South and thus enhance U.S. military power in the region. So when Kim Jong-il dies, China will likely support his chosen heirs. China’s hope is that increased economic exchange will help moderate Pyongyang, stabilize the economy and improve the lives of some people who have lived for years well below the poverty levels. Ironically, however, many North Koreans are learning about the stagnation of their country and the relative prosperity outside their borders — and thus turning restless — through DVDs and radios smuggled in by Chinese merchants. China is also attracted  by the strategic and commercial opportunities in North Korea,  namely raw materials, an even cheaper work force than its own, and access to one of Asia’s northern-most ice-free ports on the Sea of Japan. But  China should tread cautiously  if it wants to avoid triggering a major regional power rivalry in Northeast Asia. Pyongyang should also understand that direct investment from a diversity of foreign sources is in its best interest, and that there is a real risk of excessive dependency if Beijing is allowed to become the near-exclusive source of investment and aid. A multilateral regional partnership, such as the United Nations Development Program’s Greater Tumen Initiative (full disclosure: I am chairman of the business advisory council of the G.T.I.) may be the best vehicle for building stable and sustainable economic relationships with all the players in Northeast Asia. China, as the host country for the G.T.I., as well as the other members — Russia, Mongolia and South Korea — should encourage North Korea to rejoin the Initiative, from which it resigned in 2009 in response to U.N. sanctions. China has the opportunity to play a leadership role in the development of North Korea, but it must do so in a manner that ensures open  cooperation with all regional players and institutions.

A large majority of Iranian lawmakers urged their government to formally complain to the United Nations about the policy that conspicuously makes Iran and North Korea possible targets.

A large majority of Iranian lawmakers, angered over the Obama administration’s newnuclear weaponspolicy that conspicuously makesIranandNorth Koreapossible targets, urged their government on Sunday to formally complain to the United Nations in a petition that called the United States a warmonger and threat to world peace. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khameini, also spoke out against the Obama administration’s revised nuclear policy.  In remarks reported by theFars News Agency, the ayatollah said the United States is a “sinister government and cannot be trusted.” The Iranian reactions to Mr. Obama’s revised policy, which was issued last Tuesday in Washington in what is known as the presidentialNuclear Posture Review, appeared timed to coincide with the start of an international summit meeting hosted by Mr. Obama starting Monday, during which other world leaders will be talking about curbing Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Iran has been enriching uranium in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions, which has judged the enrichment and failure to disclose some of its activities to be a violation of Iran’s obligations as a signatory to the Nonproliferation Treaty. Iran has rejected Western accusations that it is engaged in a secret program to develop weapons. Under the new American policy articulated by Mr. Obama, he renounced the development of new atomic weapons and ruled out the use of nuclear arms against non-nuclear-armed states. But, he said, countries would be spared an American nuclear response only if they are in compliance with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Iran and North Korea would therefore not be protected and be potential targets. In Tehran, 220 lawmakers in  the 290-seat Assembly responded to the new American nuclear weapons policy by signing a petition  Sunday urging the Foreign Ministry to file a complaint with the United Nations against the United States as a “threat against international peace,” theParliament Web sitereported. “Such warmongering and anti-human rights language has hurt the feelings of people around the world,” the petition said. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ridiculed Mr. Obama’s new position last week as a “cowboy” policy in a speech before thousands of people,  broadcast on  Iran’s national television. “Mr. Obama, you are a newcomer to politics,” he said. “Wait until your sweat dries and get some experience. Be careful not to read just any paper put in front of you or repeat any statement recommended.”

SEOUL  — The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, was the host of a weekend party in his country’s capital, Pyongyang, for the new Chinese ambassador, both countries’ state media reported Sunday, disputing a South Korean news report that Mr. Kim visited China on Saturday. Last week, the office of President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea predicted that the North Korean leader may visit China soon. Yonhap, the national news agency of South Korea, reported Saturday that Mr. Kim appeared to have arrived in China on a special train, although other news reports later said that the train was a regular cargo train. On Sunday, the North’s official Korean Central News Agency said Mr. Kim attended a banquet Saturday evening for the new Chinese ambassador, Liu Hongcai. The official Chinese news agency, Xinhua, carried a similar report. Speculation has raged for weeks in the region that the reclusive North Korean leader might visit China soon to win badly needed economic aid in exchange for letting his negotiators return to six-nation talks on ending the North’s nuclear weapons program. Mr. Kim has visited China four times since he assumed power in the mid-1990s. Both countries did not officially confirm those visits until they were over. Outside media are eager to follow Mr. Kim’s maneuvers, and when a new visit to China is suspected, they scrutinize any unusual activities along the China-North Korea border for signs of him embarking on a clandestine trip. Many analysts in Seoul said that Mr. Kim would visit China soon. But Ha Tae-keung, head of Open Radio for North Korea, a Web site based in Seoul that collects news from informants inside the North, questioned such a theory. Mr. Kim had planned to visit China to introduce his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, who was being groomed as heir, to Chinese leaders, as well as get economic aid, Mr. Ha said Sunday. But that plan was delayed, Mr. Ha said, because of widespread discontent at home over the government’s recent decision to crack down on private markets in favor of state-run stores, a move that worsened food shortages. “It became risky for both Kims to vacate Pyongyang for the time being,” Mr. Ha said, citing information he gathered from his sources in North Korea.

The photographic images were released to support the assertion that the building in Syria that Israel destroyed in an airstrike last year was a nuclear reactor constructed with help from North Korea.

WASHINGTON — The Bush administration released detailed photographic images on Thursday to support its assertion that the building inSyriathatIsraeldestroyed in an airstrike last year was a nuclear reactor constructed with years of help fromNorth Korea. The administration said it withheld the pictures for seven months out of fear that Syria could retaliate against Israel and start a broader war in the Middle East. The photographs taken inside the reactor before it was destroyed in an air raid on Sept. 6 clearly show the rods that control the heat in a nuclear reactor, one of many close engineering similarities to a reactor halfway around the world where North Korea produced the fuel for its nuclear arsenal. While the photographs were not dated,  some  taken on the ground seemed to go back to before 2002. But after a full day of briefing members of Congress, two senior intelligence officials acknowledged that the evidence had left them with no more than “low confidence” that Syria was preparing to build a nuclear weapon. They said that there was no sign that Syria had built an operation to convert the spent fuel from the plant into weapons-grade plutonium, but that they had told President Bush last year that they could think of no other explanation for the reactor. Among the photographs shown to members of Congress and reporters on Thursday was one of the manager of North Korea’s Yongbyon nuclear plant with the director of Syria’s nuclear agency. A car in the background has Syrian license plates. When asked about North Korea’s motivation for the project, one of the senior intelligence officials said simply, “Cash.” He refused to say how much. The revelation of the plant’s existence is not new; The New York Times reported in mid-October that Israel had brought the United States evidence that the Syrian building was a partly constructed reactor. But no more than a handful of lawmakers had ever been briefed on the attack. A senior administration official, briefing reporters with the help of  the two senior intelligence officials, said for the first time that the White House had extensive discussions with Israel before the airstrike in September. The official said the White House had raised the possibility of confronting Syria with a demand that it dismantle the reactor or face the possibility of an attack. But that idea apparently never gained traction with the Israelis or some in the administration, and in the end, the official said, Israel cited satellite evidence to declare that the Syrian reactor constituted “an existential threat” to Israel because it might soon be ready for operation. The senior administration official, who was a central player in Mr. Bush’s deliberations, added that Israel’s attack proceeded “without a green light from us.” “None was asked for, none was given,” the official added. While one of the senior intelligence officials said that the United States agreed that Syria was “good to go” in turning on the reactor, it would have been years before it could have produced weapons fuel. It is unclear how the Syrians planned to get the uranium they needed. Once they got it, the reactor would have had to run for roughly 18 months before the fuel was “cooked.” And then to turn it into weapons-grade plutonium, it would require reprocessing, presumably outside the country unless Syria found a way to build its own plant. The announcement on Thursday closes one chapter of a secretive intelligence and military operation and opens several others that will play out over the remainder of the Bush presidency. The crucial question now is how the North Koreans will react. Some officials said that they hoped the announcement would embarrass the North into admitting to nuclear proliferation activities, while others said it could prompt the North to walk away from the negotiating table — and collapse the deal  Mr. Bush was hoping to reach by the end of his presidency. In return for North Korea’s declaration of all its nuclear activities, the United States would lift sanctions and begin to negotiate the North Koreans’ reward for turning over their fuel and weapons. The announcement also raises the possibility of new tensions with Syria, as the White House on Thursday accused the Syrian government of a “cover-up” consistent with a government that “supports terrorism, takes action that destabilizes Lebanon” and allows militants to enter Iraq. Last year, Mr. Bush ordered that knowledge of the Syrian  project be limited to a few crucial officials, and he put the C.I.A. in charge of marshaling the assets of other intelligence agencies. Still, the Americans were somewhat blindsided. By their own account, they suspected that North Korea and Syria were at work together in Syria, but only identified the plant at Al Kibar, named for the nearest town, after they received photos of the interior of the plant last spring from Israel, American and Israeli officials said last year. Only selected pictures were released by the intelligence agencies on Thursday, including a video that combined still photos and drawings, and had a voice-over that gave the presentation the feel of a cold-war-era newsreel about the Korean War. In fact, it was intended in part, officials said, to try to draw that war — in which the United States and North Korea never signed a peace treaty — to a close. But inside the administration, the battle over whether to try to strike a deal with North Korea or keep it under sanctions in hopes of setting off the collapse of its government continues into the last months of Mr. Bush’s term. Representative Peter Hoekstra, a Republican from Michigan, expressed annoyance on Thursday that the administration waited seven months to brief Congress. “I think many people believe that we were used today by the administration,” he said. At the C.I.A., Gen. Michael V. Hayden, the agency’s director, told employees on Thursday that they should “take heart because our team effort on the Al Kibar reactor is a case study in rigorous analytic tradecraft, skillful human and technical collection, and close collaboration.” But even this victory, some experts note, raises questions about the agency’s focus. The reactor was built within 100 miles of the Iraqi border yet never identified even though the administration was searching for any form of such arms programs in Iraq. Moreover, even some senior officials of the administration acknowledge that they are likely to leave Mr. Bush’s successor with a North Korea with roughly 10 nuclear weapons or fuel for weapons, up from the one or two weapons it had when Mr. Bush  took office in 2001. “I’d say the score is Kim Jong-il eight, and Bush zero,” said Graham Allison, a Harvard professor and author of “Nuclear Terrorism,” who was in Washington on Thursday to testify about Iran’s nuclear program. “And if you can build a reactor in Syria without being detected for eight years, how hard can it be to sell a little plutonium to Osama bin Laden?”

This Bush administration’s confessions of doubt about a secret nuclear program in North Korea had less to do with a sudden burst of candor than the fact that Pyongyang has agreed to readmit nuclear inspectors.
==::==
2007-03-02T00:00:00Z

We would like to believe that the Bush administration has finally figured out how dangerous and counterproductive it is to hype intelligence — and that that’s why officials are admitting they’re not sure North Korea ever got very far with a secret uranium-based nuclear program. But we doubt it. It was just last month that intelligence officials, with their bosses’ clear blessings, were insisting that Iran’s leaders had personally ordered the smuggling of especially lethal roadside bombs into Iraq. At least they did until the Pentagon’s top general admitted that no one knew who in Iran was really calling those shots, and  President Bush announced that it didn’t matter anyway. So we suspect that this week’s confessions of doubt about North Korea had less to do with a sudden burst of candor than the fact that Pyongyang has agreed to readmit nuclear inspectors — who probably won’t be able to find the active uranium enrichment program the administration has been alleging for more than four years. Add to that the White House’s eagerness for a diplomatic win in these bleak times — and its insistence that a nuclear deal cannot go ahead if the North is believed to be hiding things — and you understand why the White House might find this truth so convenient. Late may be better than never, but it isn’t nearly enough to make up for the damage caused. And we haven’t even raised the issue of Iraq and its long-gone weapons. Let’s be clear. The North Koreans had and have an illicit nuclear arms program. They tested a device from their plutonium-based program last October. And Pakistan’s president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, has admitted that North Korea bought some 20 centrifuges — useful only for enriching uranium — from Abdul Qadeer Khan’s nuclear black market. The problem is that the Bush administration eagerly spun those 20 centrifuges into an industrial-scale enrichment program, and then used it as an excuse to scuttle a Clinton-era deal to close down the North’s plutonium-based weapons program. Four years later, the North set off that test. And while we are pleased that the administration has finally managed to negotiate an agreement to start shutting down the North’s nuclear complex, there is no guarantee that Pyongyang will ever give up its weapons. If that’s not bad enough, consider some frightening truths. There is no doubt that Iran is moving ever closer to mastering the skills it will need to produce the fuel for a nuclear weapon — and blithely defying the Security Council’s demand that it stop. But even America’s closest European allies have little stomach for a showdown with Tehran, while Russia and China have strong economic incentives to look the other way. Which means that Washington is the only one left out there to warn the world about the dangers of a nuclear-capable Iran. Make no mistake: there are real and present dangers out there. But who still believes warnings from this White House?

Andrei Lankov’s fatalistic description of North Korea’s ability to lead other states around by the nose (“North Korean blackmail,” Views, Nov. 25) makes one really wonder: Does the situation have to be this bad and, increasingly, so dangerous? Surely the major players in East Asia should be able to agree that the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is a vital interest of all the parties. The United States, for its part, has never supported policies to spread nuclear weapons within the region. Perhaps it is time to call upon China to meet its responsibilities as a regional leader and to work rapidly toward assuring the necessary adjustments in North Korean behavior. Surely there is nothing in Marxist ideology that should cause Beijing to protect a degenerating dynasty.

In their World Cup openers, Cristiano Ronaldo and Maicon each defied belief with completely audacious, unusual, and memorable play.
==::==

==::==
JOHANNESBURG — The World Cup was in its 13th and 14th games when two players each did something so completely audacious, so unusual and so memorable that some commentators refused to believe it was intended. Shame on them. Cristiano Ronaldoof Portugal clearly intended to fire a 30-meter shot at the Ivory Coast goal in the 11th minute Tuesday, although it ricocheted off the post. He attempts those all the time, it is his trademark. For studio experts to deny him credit for at least trying the spectacular simply shows the lack of imagination from these former players. Ronaldo didn’t score, and more the pity. We are starved of goals at this event because, with a few exceptions like Argentina, South Korea and, above all, Germany, there seems to be almost a pact between teams that it’s better to settle for a draw than risk a defeat. And then came game 14. For the better part of an hour, North Korea defended stoically, stubbornly against a Brazil side that has come to be more pragmatic, harder to beat, even downright dull. It is the order of Carlos Dunga, the Brazil coach. He has chosen to trim flair from the Brazil side, to pack it with tough-minded “winners” in order to win ugly if necessary, but to win. So there it stood, 55 minutes gone, another scoreless end in prospect, and a crowd at Ellis Park stadium almost frigid on two levels. It was the coldest night of the year in Johannesburg, the wind from the south bringing temperatures down. And the crowd was also frigid with boredom because the North Koreans couldn’t attack with real intent and Brazil wouldn’t. Then it happened. Brazil’s right back, Maicon, having already had the most aggressive shot of the match saved by the goalkeeper, Ri Myong-guk, suddenly did something so thrilling, so brilliant, that it seems people decided it must have been a fluke. Nothing about it suggests those curmudgeons are right. The body language of Maicon before he attempted the shot, the anticipation on his face as he released it off the outside of his right foot and the celebration he started almost before it entered the net were all the signs of a gifted sportsman knowing exactly what he is doing. To deny Maicon full credit for attempting, and pulling off, the almost impossible would be akin to denying that Tiger Woods has the uncanny ability to roll in a 35-foot putt against the odds. Or to deny that Magic Johnson ever had, well, magic in his locker. Maicon’s was a magic shot. He received the ball almost level with the post, on the right of the goal. As replays clearly show, he saw the keeper come off his line. The goalkeeper never considered that Maicon might attempt a shot from that angle. But that’s just what the Brazilian did. He sliced the ball behind the goalkeeper’s back and around that near post so that it swerved, nice and gentle, inside the far post and across the line. It is a gift, and one that, strangely, fullbacks rather than strikers seem to conjure out of nowhere. Think of Roberto Carlos, until recently Brazil’s left back. Think of the outrageous swerve he could induce on a shot or a free kick — both swerve and astonishing power. Think of Carlos Alberto’s fourth goal in the final of the 1970 World Cup, when the incomparable Brazil beat Italy. Think of Nelinho, again a Brazilian and again a fullback, cutting the ball into the net from a seemingly implausible angle to beat the Italian Dino Zoff, one of the game’s goalkeeping legends, in the third-place playoff match of the 1978 World Cup. It might be coincidence that each of these unforgettable shots came from fullbacks. But it shouldn’t surprise us because fullback is a misnomer in Brazilian terms. These players are more often counter-attackers, intent on galloping forward and having a go. And the finishing is not a freak of nature or a spur-of-the-moment thing. Brazilians train to do it. At their camp at Teresopolis above Rio de Janeiro, they have been practicing to swerve shots — either dead-ball free kicks or on the run — since the days of Rivelino of the 1970 World Cup vintage. They use cardboard, metal or plastic figures of opposing players to make the angle almost impossible, and then perfect the technique of applying spin to carry the ball up, over or around the static objects. Tenacious as they proved, North Korea’s obdurate defenders invited this kind of target practice on Tuesday. And when Maicon applied his technique, some critics said he could not have meant it. But his goal was like water on a parched tongue. Best to cherish it, not deny what our eyes told us happened.

A new treaty and a posture review will bolster American credibility and make a dangerous world safer.
==::==

==::==
President Obama has spoken eloquently about his vision of a world without nuclear weapons. It is a lofty goal that will not be achieved during his presidency — or for years after that. But in a very dangerous time, he is taking important steps to make the world safer and bolster this country’s credibility as it tries to constrain the nuclear ambitions of Iran, North Korea and others. Two decades after the end of the cold war, the United States and Russia still have a combined total of more than 20,000 nuclear weapons. Mr. Obama has revived arms control negotiations, and later this week,  he and President Dmitri Medvedev of Russia will sign a new agreement (the first since 2002) that will reduce the number of strategic warheads each side has deployed from 2,200 to 1,550. On Tuesday,Mr. Obama releasedhis Nuclear Posture Review. It does not go as far as it should, but it is an important down payment on a saner nuclear policy. The document substantially narrows the conditions under which the United States would use nuclear weapons. The last review — done in 2002 by the George W. Bush administration — gave nuclear weapons a “critical role” in defending the country and its allies and suggested that they could be used against foes wielding chemical, biological or even conventional forces. The new review says the “fundamental role” of nuclear weapons is to deter nuclear attack on the United States and its allies,  and it rules out the use of nuclear weapons against nonnuclear countries, even if they attack the United States with unconventional weapons. There is an important caveat. That assurance only goes to countries that are in compliance with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which leaves out North Korea and Iran. It would have been better if Mr. Obama made the “sole” purpose of nuclear weapons deterring a nuclear attack. No one in their right mind can imagine the United States ever using a nuclear weapon again. America’s vast conventional military superiority is more than enough to defend against most threats. This formulation seems mainly intended to deter hard-line critics on Capitol Hill. But any loophole undercuts Washington’s arguments that nonnuclear states have no strategic reason to develop their own arms. Mr. Obama has wisely made the prevention of nuclear terrorism and proliferation a central strategic priority. And the administration has rightly decided to lead by example. We were especially encouraged to see the review’s statement that the country “will not develop new nuclear warheads.”  There is still some wiggle room, which we hope is not exercised. New nuclear warheads are not needed. The review commits to pursuing further arms reductions with Russia. And it says that future talks must also focus on cutting back the 15,000 warheads, in total, that the United States and Russia keep as backup — the so-called hedge — and short-range nuclear weapons. The United States has 500 tactical nuclear weapons, which are considered secure, but Russia has 3,000 or more that are far too vulnerable to theft. Any agreement will take years to complete, and Mr. Obama and Mr. Medvedev should start talking now. The review also commits to talking to China about its arsenal. Mr. Obama has committed to maintaining the safety and security of America’s nuclear stockpile. He has already backed that up with an extra $624 million in next year’s budget for the nuclear labs and promised — far too generously, in our view — an additional $5 billion over the next five years to build up their aging infrastructure. Mr. Obama has also promised support for more advanced conventional arms. None of those measures are likely to quiet his critics, who already are charging that Mr. Obama is weakening America’s defenses. They will likely get even louder when it comes time to ratify the New Start treaty with Russia and the long-deferred Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The stakes for this country’s security are high. And most Americans aren’t paying attention. Mr. Obama has a strong argument. He will need to push back hard.

South Africahas intercepted a North Korean weapons shipment bound for Central Africa, South African officials informed the United Nations. The seizure took place in November, when South African authorities received information that a ship headed for Congo Republic was carrying suspicious cargo, according to a letter South Africa recently sent to the Security Council. South Africa intercepted the vessel and seized parts for T-54 and T-55 tanks. Several Western diplomats said the shipment violated Security Council Resolution 1874, which banned all North Korean arms exports in response to its nuclear test last year.

Chinese reports indicated that the North Korean leader signaled a willingness to take part in talks on its nuclear program, but local reports made no mention of it.

SEOUL, South Korea — In a potential shift of policy, the North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, told a visiting Chinese envoy on Friday that his government was willing to return to multilateral talks to discuss itsnuclear weaponsprogram, the official Chinese news agencyXinhua reported. In a meeting in Pyongyang, the North’s capital, Mr. Kim told the envoy, Dai Bingguo, thatNorth Koreastill adhered to “the goal of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” and was “willing to resolve the relevant problems through bilateral and multilateral talks,” Xinhua said. The North’s return to six-nation talks on dismantling its nuclear weapons program could open the way for bilateral talks with Washington. The Obama administration has not yet replied to North Korea’s invitation for the American special representative for North Korea policy, Stephen W. Bosworth, to travel there for such discussions. The North’s official news agency,K.C.N.A., reported that Mr. Kim and Mr. Dai had discussed “issues of mutual concern,” with no word on Mr. Kim’s reported comment on multilateral talks. The Obama administration has maintained that it would accept bilateral talks with North Korea — long a goal of Mr. Kim’s government — only if the North agreed to return to six-party talks. It has urgedChina, host to the six-nation discussions and North Korea’s last major ally and trading partner, to use its influence to persuade Pyongyang to return to the multilateral forum. Since 2003, the six-nation talks — which include the two Koreas, the United States, China, Russia and Japan — have been the main forum where the regional powers have tried to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions. But the North called the talks “dead” and insisted on a direct dialogue with Washington after the regional powers joinedUnited Nations sanctionsthat were imposed on the North in the aftermath of its nuclear test in May. During the meeting in Pyongyang, Mr. Dai presented Mr. Kim with a letter from President Hu Jintao of China. Xinhua quoted Mr. Hu as saying in his letter that it was “China’s consistent goal to realize denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and to safeguard and promote peace, stability and development of Northeast Asia.” This year, China and North Korea are celebrating 60 years of formal relations. Wen Jiabao, China’s prime minister, is expected to visit North Korea early next month to celebrate the anniversary, according to South Korean officials. South Korean officials, including President Lee Myung-bak, have voiced caution, saying that a series ofrecentconciliatorygesturesby North Korea may be a ploy to ease international sanctions. “The reason North Korea is insisting on direct talks with the United States is that it wants to be recognized as a nuclear state and start nuclear arms reduction talks with the United States,” Yu Myung-hwan, the South Korean foreign minister, said in a speech in Seoul. In such talks, he said, the North would demand the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea.

The United States fears the leakage of fissile materials to other states or terrorist organizations.
==::==
2009-05-29T00:00:00Z
==::==
WASHINGTON — The United States is pressingChinato consider taking a variety of severe sanctions againstNorth Korea, including the inspection of suspect ships and planes, as it tries to ratchet up the global response toPyongyang’s latest nuclear test, administration officials said Thursday. But it is not clear that the Chinese government has the stomach for a heightened showdown with North Korea, these officials said, even though its criticism of the underground test on Monday was unusually vehement. The administration’s initiative reflects a belief that the greatest threat posed by a nuclear North Korea is the leakage of critical weapons parts or fissile material to other states or terrorist organizations, rather than the prospect of North Korea’s making one of its neighbors a target for a bomb. President Obama’s national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, described the proliferation threat in some detail in a speech in Washington on Wednesday evening. The White House has not said publicly whether it supports enforcing a2006 United Nations Security Council resolution, passed after the North’s first nuclear test, that permits the inspection of ships suspected of carrying missile parts or nuclear technology. Those operations could be tricky: North Korea has said it will regard such an action as an act of war, and American intelligence about North Korean shipments has been poor. The North’s involvement in the construction of a Syrian nuclear reactor went undetected for years, until shortly before Israel destroyed the reactor in September 2007. Yet there is a growing conviction in Washington and other capitals that North Korea’s actions demand a stronger response than the usual menu of economic sanctions and political rebukes that have left the nation isolated but unbowed in its pursuit of nuclear status. The administration is also seeking China’s cooperation in a global effort to disrupt the flow of money to North Korea’s ruler, Kim Jong-il, and his family, officials said. Some of that money is suspected to be held in Chinese-owned banks, making such an effort diplomatically sensitive. Still, a senior official said he was “pleasantly surprised” by how open China was to cooperating with the United States. China has historically tolerated the erratic behavior of Mr. Kim, worrying more about a calamitous collapse of his government than about his nuclear ambitions. But the recent test and missile launchings, the official said, may have crossed a line with China’s leaders. “At the level of Chinese irritation, this is historic,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. “Normally, the Chinese urge us not to react. But they are reaching a point where they could be agreeable to using more of their own weight.” The Chinese, officials said, have taken note of South Korea’s decision this week to join an American-led security campaign to stop the spread of nuclear material, as well as the harsh words about North Korea from some parts of Japan’s political establishment. The United States is to discuss efforts to intercept ships coming from North Korea with officials from South Korea and Japan at a regional security conference this weekend in Singapore, where the defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, will meet with his Japanese and South Korean counterparts. The deputy secretary of state, James B. Steinberg, will attend those meetings, and will then travel to Tokyo for further meetings with Japanese officials, according to the State Department. Mr. Steinberg may also be involved in negotiations with the Chinese, a senior official said. At home, the United States continued to rally support for a resolution in the United Nations. The State Department spokesman, Ian C. Kelly, said no agreement was likely to be reached for at least two days. While the major powers uniformly condemned North Korea’s test, there was some confusion Thursday about whether Russia, which holds a veto in the Security Council and is a member of the multilateral talks onNorth Korea’s nuclear program, was balking at additional sanctions. A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Andrei Nesterenko, told reporters in Moscow, “We do not need to use the language of sanctions.” Still, American and Japanese officials said they did not believe that Russia had retreated from its tough initial response. Because North Korea would regard the interception of its ships as an act of war, the Bush administration decided not to do that after the North’s first nuclear test in 2006. The United States and South Korea have alreadyraised the alert levelfor their forces in South Korea to its highest level in three years — increasing the number of surveillance flights and satellite reconnaissance — reflecting what military commanders say is a “grave threat” from North Korea. Whatever the risks, some independent experts are advising the Obama administration to put all options on the table, including a military strike on North Korea’s nuclear sites and missile launching pads. “We could have stopped this last nuclear test if we had chosen to,” said William Perry, a former defense secretary who negotiated with North Korea during the Clinton administration. “We could have stopped the first one if we had chosen to.” “That requires military action, and I’m not recommending military action,” Mr. Perry said, speaking Thursday  at the Council on Foreign Relations. “But somewhere along in this series of coercive actions, one can imagine an escalation, and if the ones that are less do not succeed, we have to be willing to consider the other ones.” The nuclear test and North Korea’s other actions, he said, suggested that the government no longer viewed its nuclear program as a chip to be used in negotiations with neighbors or the United States. Rather, he said, North Korea is determined to remain a nuclear-weapons state. This presents Mr. Obama with a different set of calculations than either President George W. Bush or President Bill Clinton confronted. “We now have a new situation that has not appeared before,” said Brent Scowcroft, a national security adviser to President Gerald R. Ford and the first President Bush, who spoke on a panel with Mr. Perry. Under these circumstances, he said, the United States had both more leverage and incentive to enlist the cooperation of China, as North Korea’s most influential neighbor.

If the United States is going to have any credibility in arguing that others must restrain their nuclear ambitions, it must restrain its own.

President George W.  Bush,  and his aides, could hardly wait to get rid of all those tiresome arms-control treaties when they took office. They tore up the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty to make way for a still largely pie-in-the-sky missile defense system. They opposed the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and never made a serious effort to win a ban on the production of fissile material (the core of a nuclear weapon). Mr. Bush grudgingly signed his one and only arms-reduction treaty with the Russians in 2002. That means that today — 20 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall — the United States and Russia still have more than 20,000 nuclear weapons, with thousands ready to launch within minutes. The bad news, of course, didn’t stop there. While Mr. Bush and his team were ridiculing treaties and arms control negotiations as “old think,” North Korea tested a nuclear device, Iran has been working overtime to produce nuclear fuel (usable for a reactor or a bomb) and many other countries are weighing whether they need to get into the nuclear game. President Obama pledged to address these dangers when he was campaigning. In her recent confirmation hearing, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton  argued that this country’s best hope of doing that is to restore treaties and a rules-based system. Now they have to translate that lofty intent into urgent action. The first challenge is Russia, the only other country besides the United States with enough weapons to blow up the planet. The administration can start by negotiating a follow-on to the 1991 Start Treaty, which is set to expire in December. The pact contains the only rules for verifying any nuclear agreement, and it provides an opportunity for making even deeper cuts. The two sides could easily go to 1,000 weapons each in this next round, down from the 1,700 to 2,200 deployed weapons agreed on in the 2002 Moscow treaty. Without any negotiations, the two can immediately take their weapons off  hair-trigger alert. We applaud the administration’s pledge to work for Senate ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and to revive negotiations on a fissile material production ban. Neither will be easy to achieve, but both are essential if Mr. Obama is serious about reining in a frightening new world of ever-expanding nuclear appetites. During the campaign, Mr. Obama opposed plans to build a new nuclear warhead. He was right. There is no military or scientific need. Defense Secretary Robert Gates is a strong advocate of the program. Mr. Obama should resist. If the United States is going to have any credibility in arguing that others must restrain their nuclear ambitions, it must restrain its own. Mr. Bush repeatedly warned about the dangers of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists. He was right. But he never put in place the strategy needed to ensure that that never happens. And he weakened some of this country’s most fundamental defenses, including its credibility. President Obama must do better. He can start by restoring the rules of the game.

WASHINGTON — The United States has slapped a handful of foreign companies with punitive sanctions for sales of technologies that it says could helpIran,SyriaandNorth Koreato develop nuclear weapons. The State Department in the Federal Register said 13 “foreign persons” — from Russia, China and Venezuela, among other countries — violated the Iran, North Korea and Syria Nonproliferation Act. The sanctions went into effect in August but were published in the register only on Thursday, State Department officials said. The measure bans American government sales of high technology munitions equipment to a number of entities, including Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, North Korea’s Korea Mining Development Corp., Russia’s Rosoboronexport and Sudan Master Technology. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, reacted sharply to the notice in the Federal Register, accusing the Bush administration of breaking international law. “These new sanctions were introduced without any international legal foundation whatsoever,” he said, speaking at a news briefing in Luxembourg after talks with Jean Asselborn, the country’s foreign minister, Reuters reported. Mr. Lavrov said the sanctions would not stop Russia’s trade with Iran. “All of our trade and all of our military-technical cooperation with Iran is carried out in strict accordance with current international legal norms,” Mr. Lavrov said. “There can be no other explanation here than the rather arrogant extraterritorial implementation of American laws.” After Mr. Lavrov’s statement, the State Department sent an e-mail message to reporters saying that it was explaining the sanctions to the affected parties. “We are in the process of informing the relevant authorities in China, Russia, South Korea, Sudan, Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates of the sanctions determinations,” said Gordon Duguid, a State Department spokesman.

Distancing himself from the Bush administration, Senator John McCain vowed to work more closely with Russia.
==::==

==::==
DENVER — SenatorJohn McCaindistanced himself from the Bush administration on Tuesday by vowing to work more closely withRussiaon nuclear disarmament and to move toward the elimination of tactical nuclear weapons in Europe. In what his campaign promoted as a major speech on nuclear security policy, Mr. McCain told a small crowd at the University of Denver that he would pursue a new arms control agreement with the Russians and that he supported a legally binding accord between the two nations to replace verification requirements in the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or Start, which expires in 2009. The Bush administration has refused to accept such binding limits on nuclear weapons, which its critics say has created paranoia in Moscow. Mr. McCain’s proposal to eliminate tactical nuclear weapons in Europe sets him apart from President Bush as well. “Russia and the United States are no longer mortal enemies,” Mr. McCain said in a speech that was interrupted at least four times by hecklers opposed to the Iraq war. “As our two countries possess the overwhelming majority of the world’s nuclear weapons, we have a special responsibility to reduce their number. I believe we should reduce our nuclear forces to the lowest level we judge necessary, and we should be prepared to enter into a new arms control agreement with Russia reflecting the nuclear reductions I will seek.” In addition, Mr. McCain said, “we should be able to agree with Russia on binding verification measures based on those currently in effect under the Start agreement, to enhance confidence and transparency.” But Mr. McCain’s talk of nuclear cooperation with Russia raised questions about how receptive Moscow might be to Mr. McCain if he were elected, when another of the senator’s proposals — excluding Russia from the Group of Eight industrialized countries — seems sure to test relations. Mr. McCain’s remarks were his most extensive as a presidential candidate on nuclear policy and were part of his effort to advance his national security credentials compared with those of Senator Barack Obama. Although Mr. McCain touched on the subject in late March in a major foreign policy address in Los Angeles, his speech in Denver served as a marker of where a McCain administration would stand on nuclear proliferation and arms deals with the Russians. He spoke less expansively about Iran andNorth Korea, the two other nations whose nuclear programs will present the next president with a tough set of decisions. But he did not signal any substantive departure from the course set by Mr. Bush in dealing with those countries. Mr. McCain made some nods to the neoconservatives in his party who have advocated a tougher line in foreign policy. But his emphasis on greater engagement with Russia and his apparent willingness to continue the administration’s current policy of maintaining contact with North Korea, primarily through multilateral talks, led some analysts to describe his approach as owing more to the so-called foreign policy realists, who tend to be less hawkish and more focused on diplomacy and multilateral institutions. In his speech, Mr. McCain also departed from Bush administration policy by promising to strengthen the Non-Proliferation Treaty, proposing increased financing for the International Atomic Energy Agency and requiring that undisclosed transfers of sensitive nuclear technology from one country to another be deemed “illicit and subject to interdiction” and by calling for nuclear talks with China. Tactical nuclear weapons are typically short-range missiles, with a reach of as little as 300 miles, but experts consider them a threat to global security because they are small, more susceptible to theft and the least regulated of weapons covered in nuclear agreements. They represent 30 percent to 40 percent of the American and Russian arsenals. In an opinion article on Tuesday in The Wall Street Journal Asia, Mr. McCain used somewhat tougher language than the administration had been using in describing how to handle North Korea. In comments viewed within the State Department as critical, Mr. McCain, writing with his good friend, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, said: “American leadership is also needed on North Korea. We must use the leverage available from the U.N. Security Council resolution passed after Pyongyang’s 2006 nuclear test to ensure the full and complete declaration, disablement and irreversible dismantlement of its nuclear facilities, in a verifiable manner, which we agreed to with the other members of the six-party talks.” Mr. McCain’s aides said the language did not represent a break with the substance of Bush administration policy but reflected Mr. McCain’s insistence that the United States be able to verify effectively any agreement in which North Korea promises to abandon its nuclear weapons. Mr. McCain has long supported six-party talks — among the United States, North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan and Russia — intended to reach such a deal. In his speech in Denver, Mr. McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, like his Democratic competitors, called for a world free of nuclear weapons, and cited as his model the standard bearer of the Republican Party, President Ronald Reagan. “A quarter of a century ago, President Ronald Reagan declared, ‘Our dream is to see the day when nuclear weapons will be banished from the face of the Earth,’ ” Mr. McCain said. “That is my dream, too.” He added, “It is time for the United States to show the kind of leadership the world expects from us, in the tradition of American presidents who worked to reduce the nuclear threat to mankind.” Nuclear policy experts said it was politically notable that Mr. McCain reached back to what Republicans consider the glory days of Reagan, whose views on the arms race evolved until he ultimately broke with the hardliners in his administration. More recently, the experts noted, a so-called Gang of Four of national security statesmen have called for a nuclear-free world: former Secretaries of State Henry A. Kissinger and George P. Shultz; former Secretary of Defense William J. Perry; and former Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia and the former chairman of the Armed Services Committee. Mr. Obama and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton have endorsed the Gang of Four approach. Mr. Obama called last October for “a world in which there are no nuclear weapons,” a fact his campaign underscored on Tuesday. “By embracing many aspects of Barack Obama’s nonproliferation agenda today,” said a statement from Mr. Obama’s spokesman, Bill Burton, “John McCain highlighted Obama’s leadership on nuclear weapons throughout this campaign, and his bipartisan work with Richard Lugar in the Senate. No speech by John McCain can change the fact that he has not led on nonproliferation issues when he had the chance in the Senate.” Mr. McCain’s advisers said many people had had a hand in the speech, among them Randy Scheunemann, Mr. McCain’s chief foreign policy aide; Mr. Kissinger; Mr. Shultz; Robert Kagan, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace; former Secretary of the Navy John F. Lehman; R. James Woolsey, a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency; Richard Burt, a former United States chief negotiator to the Start talks; and Rich Williamson, a former deputy United States ambassador to the United Nations.

China has reduced freight traffic toNorth Koreain recent weeks, holding up some shipments offood aid, the World Food Program and rail authorities said. The move is apparently in anger over Chinese trains missing in North Korea, where they are sometimes disassembled and sold as scrap metal. “A lot of Chinese rail cars have piled up in North Korea and have not come back,” said an official of China’s Railways Bureau in Dandong, through which most of the freight passes. “So on this side, we reduced the number of cars going to North Korea.”

SenatorHillary Rodham Clintonsharply criticized SenatorBarack Obamafor the first time yesterday as inexperienced on national security, calling him “irresponsible and frankly naïve” for saying he would be willing to meet without preconditions with leaders ofIran,North Koreaand three other nations during his first year as president. Mr. Obama responded swiftly, saying the Clinton campaign was concocting a “fabricated controversy.” He also contended that Mrs. Clinton’s skeptical view of such meetings was similar to that of President Bush. Mrs. Clinton’s remark was a rare instance of her personally intensifying the months-old effort by her campaign to portray her, a two-term senator and former first lady, as the most prepared Democrat to become commander in chief in 2009, and Mr. Obama, a senator since 2005, as not ready for the job. Mr. Obama, meanwhile, has for months questioned Mrs. Clinton’s judgment on national security, particularly her vote in 2002 to authorize the war in Iraq. The candidates’ back-and-forth was the continuation of a disagreement that began Monday night as a flash point in the YouTube debate of the eight Democratic presidential candidates. Mrs. Clinton’s criticism of Mr. Obama yesterday came in response to a reporter’s question about an Obama campaign memorandum that was released earlier in the day. The memorandum, from Mr. Obama’s communications staff, accused her of flip-flopping on whether she would talk directly with leaders of those countries as well as of Cuba, Syria and Venezuela. Mrs. Clinton has never publicly promised to talk directly to those leaders. But on the campaign trail this spring she has repeatedly criticized the Bush administration for not dealing directly with Iranian leaders, and she has chided President Bush for saying “he will not talk with bad people.” The candidates were asked at the debate if they would be willing to meet unconditionally with those five leaders,  people the Bush administration regards as hostile at best. Mr. Obama said he would, citing a history of American diplomacy with enemies. “It is a disgrace that we have not spoken to them,” he said. He also recalled President Ronald Reagan as excoriating Soviet leaders publicly while negotiating with them privately, an example that Mrs. Clinton has also used, almost word-for-word, in criticizing current White House diplomatic strategy. Mrs. Clinton replied next, and chose not to reach for the Soviet example. Instead she gave a toughly worded answer about the complexities of diplomacy, an answer that was not inconsistent with her past remarks, yet that conveyed sharpened skepticism about the leaders of nations like Iran and North Korea. While pledging a “very vigorous diplomatic effort” including presidential envoys “to test the waters,” she said she would not “promise a meeting at that high a level before you know what the intentions are.” “I don’t want to be used for propaganda purposes,” Mrs. Clinton said. “We’re not going to just have our president meet with Fidel Castro and Hugo Chávez and, you know, the president of North Korea, Iran and Syria until we know better what the way forward would be,” she added to applause. Within hours, Clinton advisers were arguing that Mr. Obama’s response was too soft, while Obama advisers were making two points: That their candidate was not promising meetings but said only that he was willing to consider them, and that Mrs. Clinton’s response mirrored the president’s pattern of not meeting with leaders of “rogue nations,” as he calls them. By yesterday morning, both the Obama and Clinton campaigns had prepared memorandums to showcase these talking points. The Obama campaign released its memorandum first, arguing that Mr. Obama would pursue “tough diplomacy” but also use carrots like leader-to-leader talks; Mrs. Clinton, the document asserted, disagreed with using “every tool at the president’s disposal to address problems before they become threats.” A half-hour later, a reporter from The Quad-City Times, in Iowa, asked Mrs. Clinton about the Obama campaign memorandum. According to the newspaper, Mrs. Clinton said that she had not reversed herself on leader-to-leader talks — and that she would not rule them out. But she also asserted, according the paper, that Mr. Obama was regretting his answer at Monday’s debate, an answer, she said, “that was irresponsible and frankly naïve.” Obama advisers said yesterday that they had struck a nerve, prompting Mrs. Clinton to attack. While the Obama memorandum came first, it is another thing for the candidate, in this case, Mrs. Clinton, to go on the offensive herself. The Clinton campaign, meanwhile, arranged for reporters to interviewMadeleine K. Albright, a secretary of state under President Bill Clinton. Ms. Albright, who supports Mrs. Clinton, said her answer in the debate was “very sophisticated” and showed her “understanding of how the diplomatic tool needs to be used.” While Ms. Albright declined to comment on Mr. Obama’s response, the Clinton campaign released its own memorandum doing so yesterday afternoon. “Senator Obama has committed to presidential-level meetings with some of the world’s worst dictators without precondition during his first year in office,” it argued. “Senator Clinton is committed to vigorous diplomacy but understands that it is a mistake to commit the power and prestige of America’s presidency years ahead of time by making such a blanket commitment.” Mr. Obama chose to respond by doing his own interview with The Quad-City Times. “I didn’t say these guys were going to come over for a cup of coffee some afternoon,” the newspaper quoted him as saying. “From what I heard, the point was, well, I wouldn’t do that because it might allow leaders like Hugo Chávez to score propaganda points,” he said, referring to the Venezuelan president. “I think that is absolutely wrong.” According to the newspaper, Mr. Obama also said that, in terms of national security, an example of “irresponsible and naïve” action was voting to authorize the Iraq war, as Mrs. Clinton had. Both campaigns declined requests to interview the candidates yesterday.

North Korea is demanding the return of $25 million in frozen bank funds before it resumes negotiations over dismantling its nuclear arms program.
==::==
2007-03-24T00:00:00Z
==::==
WASHINGTON, March 23 — The Bush administration said Friday that it had been more difficult than anticipated to fulfill an agreement to return $25 million in frozen bank funds toNorth Koreaand that a top Treasury official would fly to China to help free the money. North Korea is demanding the return of the money before it resumes negotiations over dismantling its nuclear arms program. The funds are being held in Banco Delta Asia in Macao and are to be transferred to a North Korean account at the Bank of China. But that shift has been delayed by technical banking and regulatory issues, diplomats said. On Friday, Bush administration officials insisted that the Chinese authorities were holding up the transfer, and that the Chinese were looking to American officials for guidance on how to return the funds without violating regulations against money laundering  that required the money to be frozen in 2005. The impasse has puzzled and frustrated people involved in the North Korea negotiations, and some public comments in the past week have led to an appearance of finger-pointing between the State and Treasury Departments. They deny they are blaming each other, but their comments suggest a difference of perspective. Christopher R. Hill, the State Department envoy who negotiated the disarmament accord with North Korea, has said repeatedly that an agreement in principle for the funds to be returned was for bank officials to work out, and that he hoped it could be done as quickly as possible. “It’s proving to be a much more complex task to get funds back to North Korea,” Mr. Hill said in Tokyo on Friday. Earlier, in Beijing, he said, “I think it’s really a problem for bank people to be working on.” “I’m not sure there’s much we can do,” he added. Shortly after those comments, which seemed to throw the ball to the Treasury Department, that department announced that Daniel Glaser, a deputy assistant secretary for terrorist financing and financial crimes, would leave for China on Saturday to help the authorities there clear up the funds transfer matter. Still, administration officials sought to dispel any impression on Friday that the departments headed by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. were at cross purposes. Top officials made nearly identical statements saying that everyone agreed on the return but that implementation was difficult. “The policy decision about the disposition of the assets has been made,” Ms. Rice said before leaving for the Middle East. “I’ve never had closer collaboration with a colleague than with Hank Paulson.” At issue is $25 million in 52 different accounts in Banco Delta Asia linked to North Korea. Some of the funds are said by American officials to be related to illegal activities like money laundering, counterfeiting, and narcotics and weapons trafficking. Others are said to be from legitimate business activities. A former administration official who remains close to current policy makers said Treasury aides had been taken aback when the State Department agreed to return all $25 million, including the tainted funds. When the money became a bargaining chip used by American negotiators to get a nuclear deal with North Korea, Treasury Department officials had to scramble and work with the Chinese to carry out  the deal without waiving bank regulations, he said. Officials say the accord now involves getting permission from the 52 account holders to seize their funds, transfer them to a bank in China and channel them to another purpose. One account holder, Daedong Credit Bank, North Korea’s only foreign-managed bank, which reportedly holds $7 million, is threatening to sue the Chinese and the Macao authorities if the funds are transferred to someone else, according to news reports in Asia. Also, the Bank of China, a large Chinese state-owned bank, is not keen to receive funds seen as tainted, said officials and others close to the situation who would not use their names because of the delicacy of the negotiations. A lawyer familiar with the negotiations said that China’s reluctance was understandable. “These bank deposits have been identified as toxic waste,” he said. “Now, this is like you and me agreeing that it should all go in a neighbor’s basement. The neighbor might want some time to think about that.”

The deal was a major step toward establishing a comprehensive free trade pact between Asean and China.

CEBU, Philippines, Jan. 14 — China signed a new trade  agreement on services with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations here on Sunday, and won support for its initiative to reconvene negotiations withNorth Koreaover its nuclear weapons program. Delegates called the trade in  services deal, which emphasizes high-technology, energy and construction, a major step toward establishing a comprehensive free trade pact between Asean and China. “We are very happy to have China as our big brother in this region,” President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo of the Philippines said at the opening ceremony of the one-day meeting in Cebu, a central Philippine province. Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China said the agreement he signed with Asean leaders would “lay the foundation for the full and scheduled completion of a China-Asean free trade agreement.” China and Asean began lowering barriers to trade in 2005. Since then, tariffs on more than 7,000 products from China and Asean have been lowered, Mr. Wen said. Two-way trade volume last year amounted to more than $160 billion, up 23 percent from 2005. The leaders of Japan, Australia, India and New Zealand were also scheduled to hold meetings with Asean leaders on Sunday, with most of the discussion centering on improving free trade. Beijing also received unqualified support for its efforts to reconvene six-party talks with North Korea over its nuclear weapons program, for which Manila has agreed to play host next month. Although Asean members had independently urged a return to the talks, officials acknowledged on Sunday the role the Chinese played in pushing the agenda. “We reaffirmed that the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is an international priority,” the leaders said in a statement released late Saturday. They said North Korea must denuclearize in a “verifiable manner” and that it must rejoin soon the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Mr. Wen’s arrival here on Saturday was greeted with more excitement than that of the other heads of state. Huge billboards along the route from the airports to the Shangri-la Mactan Resort, where the meetings were held, welcomed Mr. Wen and his wife. Cebu Province, known for its tourism and robust industries, has a sizable population of Filipinos of Chinese descent.

North Korea, the United States and China agreed after two days of informal discussions in Beijing to push for an early resumption of stalled talks over the North’s nuclear program. But no date was set, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on its Web site. Envoys for the three countries — Kim Kye-gwan of North Korea, Assistant Secretary of State Christopher R. Hill, and Vice Foreign Minister Wu Dawei of China, were not expected to hold a third day of meetings today.

American intelligence assessments say that Iran has obtained advanced missiles from North Korea based on a Russian design that are much more powerful than its other missiles.
==::==
2010-11-29T00:00:00Z
==::==
This article is byWilliam J. Broad,James GlanzandDavid E. Sanger. Secret American intelligence assessments have concluded thatIranhas obtained a cache of advanced missiles, based on a Russian design, that are much more powerful than anything Washington has publicly conceded that Tehran has in its arsenal, diplomatic cables show. Iran obtained 19 of the missiles fromNorth Korea, according to a cable dated Feb. 24 of this year. The cable is a detailed, highly classified account of a meeting between top Russian officials and an American delegation led by Vann H. Van Diepen, an official with the State Department’s nonproliferation division who, as a national intelligence officer several years ago, played a crucial role in the 2007 assessment of Iran’s nuclear capacity. The missiles could for the first time give Iran the capacity to strike at capitals in Western Europe or easily reach Moscow, and American officials warned that their advanced propulsion could speed Iran’s development of intercontinental ballistic missiles. There has been scattered but persistent speculation on the topic since 2006, when fragmentary reports surfaced that North Korea might have sold Iran missiles based on a Russian design called the R-27, once used aboard Soviet submarines to carry nuclear warheads. In the unclassified world, many arms control experts concluded that isolated components made their way to Iran, but there has been little support for the idea that complete missiles, with their huge thrusters, had been secretly shipped. The Feb. 24 cable, which is among those obtained byWikiLeaksand made available to a number of news organizations, makes it clear that American intelligence agencies believe that the complete shipment indeed took place, and that Iran is taking pains to master the technology in an attempt to build a new generation of missiles. The missile intelligence also suggests far deeper military — and perhaps nuclear — cooperation between North Korea and Iran than was previously known. At the request of the Obama administration, The New York Times has agreed not to publish the text of the cable. The North Korean version of the advanced missile, known as the BM-25, could carry a nuclear warhead. Many experts say that Iran remains some distance from obtaining a nuclear warhead, especially one small enough to fit atop a missile, though they believe that it has worked hard to do so. Still, the BM-25 would be a significant step up for Iran. Today, the maximum range of Iran’s known ballistic missiles is roughly  1,200 miles, according to experts. That means they could reach targets throughout the Middle East, including Israel, as well as all of Turkey and parts of Eastern Europe. The range of the Russian R-27, launched from a submarine, was said to be up to  1,500 miles. Rocket scientists say the BM-25 is longer and heavier, and carries more fuel, giving it a range of up to  2,000 miles. If fired from Iran, that range, in theory, would let its warheads reach targets as far away as Western Europe, including Berlin. If fired northwestward,  the warheads could easily reach Moscow. A range of 2,000 miles is considered medium or intermediate. Traditionally, the United States has defined long-range or intercontinental ballistic missiles as having ranges greater than  3,400 miles. The fuel for the advanced engines goes by the tongue-twisting name of unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine, according to the secret cables. It is a highly toxic, volatile clear liquid with a sharp, fishy smell. International concern about advances in Iran’s missile program increased last year, after Tehran sent its first satellite into space. Experts said it was clear that the second stage of the rocket, known as the Safir, had employed a new, more powerful class of engines that took advantage of some elements of the Russian technology. American government experts say the engines of the Russian R-27 represent an improvement of roughly 40 percent in lifting force over the kerosene-fired engines that power most Iranian missiles. “Without this higher-energy output, the Safir would have failed in its mission to orbit a small satellite,” said a report issued in May by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, an arms analysis group in London. The London group’s report, though, gives no indication of access to the American intelligence assessment. Indeed, the report argued that while Iran had some elements of the R-27 technology, the available public evidence suggested that it had made no purchase of either the complete North Korean missile or its Russian parent. The cables say that Iran not only obtained the BM-25, but also saw the advanced technology as a way to learn how to design and build a new class of more powerful engines. “Iran wanted engines capable of using more-energetic fuels,” the Feb. 24 cable said, “and buying a batch of BM-25 missiles gives Iran a set it can work on for reverse engineering.” The cable added that Tehran could use the BM-25 technologies as “building blocks” for the production of long-range missiles. But it offered no information to back up that assessment.

The two journalists were on a reporting trip to the border between China and North Korea.

SEOUL, South Korea — Two American journalists on a reporting trip to the border betweenChinaandNorth Koreahave been detained by the North Korean military, a human rights activist and another source said Thursday. Laura Ling, a Chinese-American, and Euna Lee, a Korean-American, were believed to have been detained by North Korean border guards on Tuesday morning. Their Chinese guide, an ethnic Korean, was also detained.  A third journalist, Mitch Koss, was believed to have remained in China. Aaron Tarver, a spokesman at the United States Embassy in Seoul, could not immediately confirm the report. The journalists went to China last week to report on North Korean refugees in northeastern China, according to Chun Ki-won, a Christian clergyman  in Seoul who helped arrange their trip, and Lee Hark-joon, a reporter withthe Chosun Ilbo, South Korea’s leading daily newspaper, who met them last week in Seoul. North Korea condemns the presence of foreign journalists in the border area  reporting on the plight of North Koreans who have recently fled  hunger and political repression at home  and accuses them of acting as American spies. The journalists’ reported detention comes at a tense moment in American relations with North Korea. The North has announced that it will launch a communications satellite early next month and has ordered American aid groups to leave the country. On Thursday, Japan threatened to tighten sanctions on the North if it proceeded with the rocket launch, which Washington and Tokyo see as a cover for testing ballistic missile technology. “We will make a comprehensive decision, including the possibility of imposing tougher sanctions,” Prime Minister Taro Aso of Japan told a parliamentary committee. Mr. Chun, who heads Durihana, a South Korean missionary group that assists  North Korean refugees in China, said he learned of the journalists’ detention from American officials. Mr. Lee said journalists from the cable channel Current TV  consulted with him about reporting on North Korean refugees before heading to China. Current TV is an independent media company that was founded by former Vice President Al Gore and a businessman,  Joel Hyatt. Mr. Chun said he last talked with the journalists at 6 a.m. Tuesday, when their Chinese guide told him that they were moving from Yanji, a Chinese town near the northeastern end of the China-North Korean border, to Dandong, near the opposite end of the border. The journalists  entered China on March 13 via Seoul, and during their reporting had interviewed North Korean refugees living in hiding, including orphans and women who worked for pornographic Internet chat sites in the hopes of earning enough money to travel to South Korea or the United States, Mr. Chun said. It was not clear where along the 300-mile  border and under what circumstances they were detained. “They told me that they completed what they went to China for, and that they completed their assignment,” Mr. Chun said. “I warned them against getting too close to the border. I suspect that they got too ambitious.” Since the mid-1990s, famine has driven thousands of North Koreans to sneak across the Tumen and Yalu Rivers, which form the border. Arrests of Americans in the area are rare. In 1999, the State Department said an American citizen visiting a North Korean economic zone near the Chinese border had been arrested. The citizen, Karen Han, 58, a Korean-American businesswoman based in Beijing, was deported after being held for a month on unspecified charges. In a more widely reported case, in 1996 Bill Richardson, then a United States congressman from New Mexico, negotiated the release of the American citizenEvan C. Hunziker, who swam across the Yalu River, while drunk, on  what he called a mission to spread the Gospel in the North. Mr. Hunziker was detained for three months on espionage charges. Holding Japanese and South Korean citizens has long soured Pyongyang’s relations with its neighbors. On Thursday, Foreign Minister Hirofumi Nakasone of Japan said that his country faced “the most serious threat” from North Korea’s planned rocket launch and  that it would rally the international community to impose additional sanctions against the North. North Korea has informed international agencies that it will  launch its rocket between April 4 and 8 along a trajectory that crosses Japan. If the rocket launching is successful, it will give the newly elected parliament a chance to celebrate Kim Jong-il’s re-election to another five-year term as the country’s leader.  North Korea said Friday it will convene its parliament, known as the Supreme People’s Assembly, on April 9. After North Korea  detonated its first nuclear device in 2006, the United Nations  Security Council adopted a resolution banning it  from nuclear tests and all ballistic missile activities. Japan joined global sanctions banning arms and luxury goods trade with North Korea. But international sanctions have little impact on the North Korean regime, which has survived decades of isolation as  famine has killed thousands of its people. The North showed its imperviousness to outside influence this week when it informed the United States it no longer wanted to receivefood aidand told five American aid groups to leave by the end of the month. No international sanctions work effectively without  cooperation from China, the North’s main ally and biggest trade partner, but Beijing remains wary of American moves to increase economic pressure on North Korea and favors a policy of engagement. On Thursday, China’s official People’s Daily newspaper said that Prime Minister  Wen Jiabao told his North Korean counterpart, Kim Yong-il, during a meeting on Wednesday in Beijing that China wanted to “actively push forward” deadlocked nuclear disarmament talks involving the two Koreas, China, the United States, Russia and Japan.

The United Nations nuclear watchdog pledged Friday to investigate whether Syria secretly built an atomic reactor with North Korean help.

VIENNA (Reuters) — The United Nations nuclear watchdog pledged Friday to investigate whetherSyriahad secretly built an atomic reactor with North Korean help, but the agency also criticized the United States for delaying the release of intelligence. The United States disclosed its intelligence material on Thursday, saying the Syrian reactor was “nearing operational capability” a month before Israeli warplanes bombed it on Sept. 6. Mohamed ElBaradei, director of theInternational Atomic Energy Agency, criticizedIsraelon Friday for the airstrike, saying his inspectors should have been able to inspect the site before the bombing. Dr. ElBaradei said “the unilateral use of force by Israel” undermined “the due process of verification that is at the heart of the nonproliferation regime.” He  also said the American allegations against Syria would be investigated with due vigor. Syria denied the charges and accused Washington of involvement in the Israeli attack. Dr. ElBaradei, alluding to the United States, denounced a failure to share intelligence information “in a timely manner” about the project, which Washington said was initiated in 2001. He confirmed that Washington disclosed information this week and  said that a Syrian facility destroyed by an Israeli airstrike in September was an unfinished reactor. Analysts said the American disclosure did not amount to proof of an illicit nuclear arms program, because there was no sign of a reprocessing plant needed to convert spent fuel from the plant into bomb-grade plutonium. “The absence of such facilities gives little confidence that the reactor was part of an active nuclear weapons program,” David Albright and Paul Brannan of the Institute for Science and International Security said in an e-mail commentary. “The United States does not have any indication of how Syria would fuel this reactor,” they said. “This type of reactor requires a large supply of uranium fuel,” they added, saying that it “raises questions about when this reactor could have operated.” Analysts said the Bush administration had delayed releasing the intelligence because of the risk that it might prompt Syria to retaliate against Israel. Syria  pledged to cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency investigation. “Syria has nothing to hide,” its  United Nations envoy, Bashar Jaafari, told reporters on Friday in New York. “It is essential that Syria shed full light on its nuclear activities, past and present, in accordance with its international obligations,” a French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Pascale Andréani, told reporters in Paris. Syria has belonged to the 144-nation atomic energy agency since 1963, and it has one declared small research reactor subject to United Nations inspection. The White House said it was convinced thatNorth Koreahad helped Syria to construct a clandestine nuclear reactor. North Korea tested a nuclear device in October 2006.

The new caution among U.S. intelligence officials reflects adherence to what some now call “the Powell Rule.” 
==::==
2007-03-02T00:00:00Z
==::==
WASHINGTON, March 1 — For more than three years, American intelligence officials have insisted that they learned from their mistakes in the months leading to the Iraq war, when murky information about Saddam Hussein’s weapons programs was presented as fact and inconclusive judgments were hardened into statements of near certainty. The more calibrated intelligence assessments that have come to light in recent weeks, particularly onIranandNorth Korea, appear to show a new willingness by American spy agencies to concede the limits of their knowledge. The new caution reflects adherence to what some officials now call “the Powell Rule.” That rule is intended to avoid a repetition of former Secretary of StateColin L. Powell’s humiliation after the satellite photos and intercepted communications he presented to the United Nations Security Council as proof that Iraq was stockpiling banned weapons turned out to be nothing of the sort. It was in large part because of the Iraq intelligence debacle that top intelligence officials over the past year have overhauled the way in which they pass judgments about some of the world’s most difficult spying targets, including Iran and North Korea. The new operating approach is intended to ensure that intelligence is solid before it is publicly presented, and even then, that clear distinctions are made between facts and inferences. Intelligence professionals have several motivations for the new approach. Those include protecting their own credibility and ensuring that assessments can stand up to careful scrutiny in the wake of multiple government investigations condemning the prewar intelligence assessments about Iraq. Officials also said that greater caution had become ever more necessary because of increasing inexperience in the work force; about 50 percent of current intelligence analysts have less than five years of experience. At the same time, the use of specific, careful language is seen by intelligence professionals as a barrier that can help to prevent intelligence assessments from being exaggerated, twisted or otherwise misused by policy makers to advance specific agendas. Under the new guidelines, the assessments produced by intelligence agencies must include detailed descriptions of the subjects on which analysts disagree, and analysts must now “show their work” by including in their judgments the chain of logic that led them to their conclusions. Intelligence analysis has always been more art than science, and in recent statements, American intelligence officials have laid bare the limits of what they believe they know about Iran and North Korea. Officials have said they are certain that Iranian paramilitary groups are providing lethal bomb material to Iraqi Shiite groups, but they do not know whether this support has been approved at the highest levels of government in Tehran. In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee this week, Mike McConnell, the new director of national intelligence, said that it was possible Iran could produce a nuclear weapon by the beginning of the next decade, but that it was also possible Iran would not develop a weapon until 2015. At the same hearing, another top official acknowledged publicly that the American intelligence agencies were less certain today than they were five years ago about whether North Korea was pursuing a clandestine uranium enrichment program. John D. Negroponte formalized the new analytical procedures in a directive issued in January, one of his last acts as director of national intelligence. The directive stated that “the analytic process must be as transparent as possible” and that “analysis must be objective and independent of political considerations.” The pre-emptive war doctrine that President Bush has articulated since the Sept. 11 attacks holds that the United States has an obligation take action against security threats before they fully materialize. A corollary embraced by the White House has held that policy makers must assume the worst about the intentions of adversaries, even with imperfect intelligence about their intentions and capabilities. That worst-case approach was very much on display when Mr. Bush said with certainty in 2002 and 2003 that Iraq possessed chemical and biological weapons. On North Korea, Mr. Bush said in November 2002 that “contrary to an agreement they had with the United States, they’re enriching uranium, with the desire of developing a weapon.” As intelligence agencies have backed away from those views, some former officials worry that the Iraq experience may cause the pendulum to swing too far in the direction of circumspection. They say that they hope the administration does not accept at face value the denials from North Korea and Iran about their banned weapons programs. “I worry about that, but I am not willing to accept that doomsday is upon us,” said John R. Bolton, who stepped down in December as ambassador to the United Nations after it was clear he would not win Senate confirmation. Mr. Bolton said he still believed that policy makers would not allow intelligence analysts’ new caution to soften the United States’ policies toward its enemies too much. The intelligence community’s renewed emphasis on debate and dissent has been reflected in decisions about which officials earned promotions in the aftermath of the Iraq intelligence failures. Thomas Fingar, who once ran the State Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research, is now in charge of all analysis for the director of national intelligence. It was Mr. Fingar’s State Department office in 2002 that produced one of the most significant dissents to that year’s National Intelligence Estimate, now discredited, challenging the majority view that Iraq had bought aluminum tubes to build up its nuclear weapons program. During an interview late last year, Mr. Fingar said it was now his job to ensure there was as much competitive analysis as possible before intelligence reports were completed, if only to avoid a repeat of the 2002 N.I.E. findings, which were pivotal to the Senate vote that authorized the Iraq war. “The basic idea is to avoid a premature rush to an artificial consensus,” Mr. Fingar said. “The interesting thing is not when analysts agree. It’s when they disagree.”

WASHINGTON —President Obamaannounced Wednesday that he would not putNorth Koreaback on the State Department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism, after a classified study determined that the country “does not meet the statutory criteria” for that designation. President George W. Bushremoved North Korea from the listas part of a deal in which the North began to take steps to dismantle its nuclear complex at Yongbyon. But in early 2009, it conductedits second nuclear weapons testand said it would begin reversing those steps. Administration officials said that test did not meet the criteria of sponsorship of terrorism. And they said there was no evidence that the North had aided terrorists or conducted terrorist acts for many years.

Richard Haas (“Afghanistan is a war of choice,” Views, Aug. 22) writes a  thought-provoking essay, but the conclusion is  misleading. Mr. Haas finds that “doing more in Afghanistan lessens our ability to act elsewhere, including North Korea ...” But  there is little that the United States  and its allies can do at present in relation to the closed state of North Korea. Withholding more assistance to Afghanistan at a crucial moment would not benefit the North Korea situation. Viggo Fischer, Copenhagen Africa needs the basics first Thomas Friedman’s column “The land of ‘no service”’ (Views, Aug. 17) suggests “progress” in Africa is tied to  Internet access. Globalization’s benefits are touted once again. But a majority of people in Africa could benefit more from the basics  —   like  safe, potable water, roads and medical facilities  —  particularly those people who live in the bush. The lack of such necessities of life are probably not as visible to the typical “ecotourist” visiting game parks. A recent month in Southern Sudan’s bush showed me that Africans are dying from water-borne disease and malnutrition, not lack of Internet service.

SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea, Japan and the United States condemned a barrage of short-range missiles fired byNorth Koreaon Saturday, while Russia and China called for calm. North Korea fired seven ballistic missiles into the sea between the Communist state and Japan on Saturday, flouting aUnited Nations Security Councilresolution and sending a message of defiance to the United States on its Independence Day holiday. North Korea has a record of timing missile tests to coincide with July 4; the tests on Saturday constituted the North’s biggest one-day missile barrage since it launched seven missiles on July 4, 2006. After a North Koreannuclear test on May 25, the Council adopted a resolution that, among other sanctions, barred the country from testing ballistic missiles. North Korea had promised that it would respond to the resolution with more tests of its ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons, and followed through on part of that threat on Saturday. The North’s neighbors swiftly condemned the tests. In a statement, Moon Tae-young, a South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman, called them “provocations that clearly violated” the Council resolution. In Tokyo, Chief Cabinet Secretary Takeo Kawamura called the tests “a serious act of provocation against the security of neighboring countries, including Japan.” The State Department said that the tests were “not helpful” and that North Korea should “refrain from actions that aggravate tensions.” Russia and China called on all parties to show restraint and avoid actions that could further destabilize the situation, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. A South Korean military official said the missiles launched Saturday were believed to have flown 250 to 310 miles, indicating that they might be Scud-type missiles. The South Korean news agency Yonhap quoted military officials as saying the missiles were either Scud or Rodong, a scaled-up North Korean version of the Scud. All seven missiles were fired from a base near Wonsan, a coastal city east of Pyongyang between 8 a.m. and 5:40 p.m., South Korea said. The United States sent its top sanctions envoy to Beijing this week to enlist China, the North’s main trading partner and ally, in enforcing the United Nations resolution. The United Stateshas also been shadowing a North Korean shipsuspected of carrying banned weapons and cracking down on companies accused of helping the North in its arms trade.

To the Editor: Re “North Korea Says It Tested Nuclear Device” (front page, May 25): North Korea continues to show its contempt for the United Nations by announcing its second test of a nuclear device. Iran also has nothing but disdain for the United Nations as well as the European Union as it races nonstop to become nuclear. The United Nations fiddles while Rome burns. The only country with the courage to take military action against Iran is Israel, as its survival depends on Iran’s not achieving nuclear weapon capability. The civilized world has learned nothing from its painful experience with Nazi Germany. The more things change, the more they remain the same. Paul SchoenbaumWilliamsburg, Va., May 25, 2009  To the Editor: Re “Obama Pledges to ‘Take Action’ on North Korea” (front page, May 26): It is quite understandable that North Korea and Iran would seek to develop nuclear technology. Nuclear weapons are a vehicle for attaining respect and perhaps deterring hostile actions by other nations. Although it is in the self-interest of the United States to limit the number of countries with nuclear weapons, there is also arrogance in the United States’ telling other countries that they cannot do what we have done. Rather than focusing on sanctions against North Korea and Iran, the United States should seek to bring all countries with nuclear weapons potential into an alliance that would first place nuclear weapons under multilateral control and then abolish nuclear weapons — with strict requirements for monitoring and inspection. Jeff AtkinsonWilmette, Ill., May 26, 2009  To the Editor: North Korea’s nuclear test is bad news, but the United States has no basis for moral outrage until we ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. It was signed in 1996 but voted down by the Senate in 1999. Our failure to ratify sends a clear message to the world: If you have enough power, you can go ahead with your nuclear plans, unconstrained by the rest of the world. Stephen HartBuffalo, May 26, 2009  To the Editor: North Korea’s decision to test a nuclear weapon needs to serve as a warning to our elected leadership that while we are naïvely dismantling our strategic weapons and platforms, there are still nations in the world that seek to proliferate these weapons of mass destruction. I find it disturbing that in the last few years, America has retired its most capable ICBM’s and air-launched cruise missiles — critical components of a modern nuclear deterrent — while nations like Iran, North Korea, Pakistan and others continue to work on weapons of mass destruction. As long as hostile regimes seek nuclear weapons, we need to make sure that our nuclear forces are the most modern and the most capable. Rogue states and terrorists alike need to know that the United States has the power and the will to protect its people and interests around the world. Danny de Gracia IIWaipahu, Hawaii, May 25, 2009  To the Editor: My recent trip to North Korea convinced me that the North Koreans are justified in claiming that they need a nuclear weapon as a deterrent. The United States military maintains a base in South Korea and at least once a year conducts joint exercises with the South Korean military, practicing a land invasion of North Korea. The United States Air Force maintains “a nuclear umbrella” over South Korea with nuclear bombs positioned in Okinawa, Guam and Hawaii. North Korea’s neighbors, China and Russia, already have nuclear bombs; and its third neighbor, Japan, says it can produce one within six months. These are good reasons for the North Koreans to feel a need for a nuclear bomb as a deterrent. It would be easy for the new, hostile leadership of South Korea to find a pretext to launch an invasion. Paul SackSan Francisco, May 26, 2009  To the Editor: One item that has apparently not been mentioned in the recent reporting on the North Korean nuclear test is the pending 2012 centennial of Kim Il Sung’s birth — the momentousness of the event that started the new calendar in North Korea. That anniversary may well be linked to the issue of Kim Jong-il’s health and the succession problem, but we should not overlook the importance of that occasion in the planning and its relation to the development of a nuclear deterrent, missile capacity and other “prestigious” elements of North Korean power. We are likely to see more efforts to enhance that centennial, and thus regime legitimacy. David I. SteinbergWashington, May 26, 2009 The writer isa professor of Asian studies, School of Foreign Service, Georgetown University.

A dispute has erupted between Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and conservative lawmakers over her pursuit of diplomacy with North Korea.
==::==

==::==
WASHINGTON, Oct. 24 — A fight has erupted between conservatives on national security and Secretary of StateCondoleezza Riceover the Bush administration’s pursuit of diplomacy withNorth Koreain the face of intelligence that North Korea might have helpedSyriabegin construction on a nuclear reactor. The debate moved to Capitol Hill on Wednesday, when Ms. Rice had a tense private meeting with Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, the senior Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Just days earlier, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen was the co-author of an opinion article questioning the White House approach, which offers incentives to North Korea to dismantle its nuclear program. That article also criticized the Bush administration for what it called the “veil of secrecy” surrounding intelligence that led to an Israeli airstrike in Syria last month on the suspected reactor site, and for the fact that only a handful of lawmakers have been briefed on the subject. Congressional officials said that Ms. Ros-Lehtinen contended that if more lawmakers knew about the intelligence, more would be concerned about a pending nuclear agreement with North Korea. Commercial satellite photographs have begun to circulate that appear to show a reactor possibly under construction at a site in Syria near the Euphrates River. The images were taken during the summer, a month before the Israeli raid. The White House now finds itself charting a similar course to the one for which it heaped criticism on the Clinton administration in 2002, accusing it of being too trusting. At that time, a diplomatic agreement with North Korea collapsed after the White House accused North Korea of secretly continuing work on a nuclear weapon. Now, the White House is trying to deflect criticism from fellow Republicans, including even hawkish officials within the administration, that Ms. Rice is putting her desires for a diplomatic agreement above national security interests. One senior administration official, who has seen the intelligence about the Syrian site and advocates a tougher line against North Korea, said he was frustrated that even in light of possible North Korean help on a Syrian nuclear program, “we are shaking hands with the North Koreans because they have once again told us they are going to disarm.” Conservatives remain deeply suspicious of the Rice approach, fearing that it rewards North Korea. Mr. Bush was persuaded by Ms. Rice and his chief North Korea negotiator, Christopher R. Hill, that there was no other path. Mr. Hill acknowledged in a recent interview that the approach was a sharp reversal from the first term. “Republicans are brokenhearted that the administration has done a complete U-turn on this issue,” said John R. Bolton, former United States ambassador to the United Nations and an advocate of a tough approach to North Korea. But Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, while declining to talk specifically about the new intelligence, theoretically suggested taking a diplomatic approach to North Korea:  “To rein these guys inside a deal that has some transparency.” Several diplomats and administration officials representing both sides of the debate were interviewed on condition of anonymity because the intelligence about the Syrian site remained classified. The administration and the Israeli government have kept silent about the strike, but American and foreign officials with access to intelligence reports have said the target was a partly constructed nuclear reactor, apparently modeled on one North Korea has used to generate its stockpile of nuclear weapons fuel. They said it would have been years before Syria could have produced nuclear weapons fuel on its own. The Institute for Science and International Security, a private group in Washington, released areporton Wednesday that pinpointed the site in a satellite image taken Aug. 10, nearly a month before the Israeli strike. “This looks like a reactor site,” David Albright, president and founder of the institute and a former United Nations weapons inspector, said in an interview. But Mr. Albright said it was difficult to tell how advanced the construction had been because recent activity lay hidden beneath the tall building’s large roof. The desolate site is on the eastern bank of the Euphrates, 90 miles north of the Iraqi border and seven miles north of a desert village at At Tibnah. In addition to the tall building, the satellite image shows trucks, a secondary structure and a pumping station on the Euphrates, which may be significant because reactors need water for cooling. The institute’s findings, first reported Wednesday by The Washington Post, said the trucks and evidence of tracks from heavy machinery indicated “recent construction activity.” Google Earth on Tuesday posted an image of the site that showed a building clearly. However, the image is from an early construction stage and shows no obvious pumping station nearby. The SPOT Image Corporation, a commercial satellite company in Chantilly, Va., said Wednesday that its spacecraft took this picture of the site in August 2006 — a year before the newly released images. The timing of the pump’s appearance is important because intelligence analysts look at such structures as possible signatures of a nuclear reactor. A pump’s presence would make an otherwise nondescript building in the desert far more likely to serve a nuclear purpose. Analysts said Israel might have seen the pumping station as a clue to the site’s true nature. On Wednesday, a European diplomat said the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna had obtained satellite images of the site near the Euphrates and would finish analyzing them in a day or so. The agency’s inquiry, the diplomat added, would probably prove inconclusive until its inspectors could see the Syrian site in person. After the private meeting with Representative Ros-Lehtinen, Ms. Rice went before the House Foreign Affairs Committee and defended her diplomatic approach to North Korea, saying she was using “the teeth of diplomacy, not just the carrots of diplomacy.” This elicited a challenge from Representative Tom Tancredo, Republican of Colorado. “I would really like to know specifically what those teeth might be,” he said. Ms. Rice refused to comment on the Israeli strike, but repeated what has become the official view about any North Korean involvement in a Syrian nuclear program: “The president has made very clear that North Korean or Syrian or anybody else’s proliferation is of deep concern to the United States.” Mr. Tancredo persisted: “So if in fact it turns out to be the case that they did provide weaponry or some form of nuclear materials to Syria, then that would put them in violation of the agreement?” Ms. Rice again refused to be pinned down. “The United States is finally in a position to perhaps do something about the North Korean program, and I think we want to keep that capability,” she said.

The agreement on frozen funds clears the way for talks to focus on implementing a nuclear disarmament accord.

BEIJING, Monday, March 19 — The United States andNorth Koreahave resolved a standoff over North Korean funds frozen in aMacaobank, clearing the way for talks to focus on putting in place a nuclear disarmament accord, American and Chinese officials said Sunday. Assistant Secretary of State Christopher R. Hill, the chief American envoy at the talks, said his discussions with North Korean representatives over the weekend on North Korea-related accounts in Macao’s Banco Delta Asia indicated that the issue “will not be an impediment to our six-party talks.” The North Korean officials, he said, “made it very clear that they have begun their tasks for the purpose of denuclearization.” Daniel Glaser, the Treasury Department official who has been managing the United States position on the financial dispute, said in a statement on Monday that the American and North Korean governments had reached an understanding on how to deal with the $25 million still held by the bank, which the United States has said were proceeds of illicit activities by North Korea, including trading arms and narcotics. Mr. Glaser said  North Korea proposed having its deposits transferred to an account it has at the Foreign Trade Bank of the Bank of China in Beijing. He said North Korea “pledged, within the framework of the six-party talks, that these funds will be used solely for the betterment of the North Korean people, including for humanitarian and educational purposes.” The arrangement, Mr. Glaser said, should end the matter. “We believe this resolved the issue,” he said. But he said the ultimate disposition of the funds remains with banking authorities in Macao, a Chinese territory. North Korean officials have said in recent days that they will not move forward with their commitment to shut down the nation’s nuclear plant at Yongbyon by mid-April unless they recover the $25 million. Senior officials in North Korea have not yet indicated that they consider the Macao matter resolved. State Councilor Tang Jiaxuan of China told visiting Japanese lawmakers on Sunday that the United States and North Korea had resolved the dispute, Hidenao Nakagawa, secretary general of Japan’s Liberal Democratic Party, told reporters. The United States, North Korea, China, Japan, South Korea and Russia reached an agreement on Feb. 13 that gave the North 60 days to shut its Yongbyon plutonium facility in return for aid and security pledges. Representatives of the six nations were convening here on Monday to negotiate details of that agreement and establish groups to discuss other diplomatic and security concerns. Meanwhile, Mr. Hill said he hoped to set up a working group to examine the delicate issue of whether North Korea had been seeking to make nuclear fuel from a second source, highly enriched uranium, as well as its better-known effort to use plutonium for the same purpose. Bush administration officials initially asserted that the North had a clandestine uranium program under way in 2002. The assertions contributed to a collapse of an earlier agreement to freeze North Korea’s plutonium program. In October, North Korea  exploded its first nuclear device, made using plutonium. It has denied seeking to build bombs using enriched uranium, but North Korean officials have said recently that they are willing to discuss the matter with the United States.

The deal represented a bureaucratic victory for Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who has pushed for a more diplomatic approach with North Korea.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 13 — The deal that could leadNorth Koreato shut its main nuclear reactor came under criticism from both ends of the political spectrum immediately after it was announced on Tuesday. From the right, hardliners argued that the United States should have held out until North Korea agreed to fully declare and dismantle its entire nuclear program. From the left, Democrats argued that the deal was no better than one they said the United States could have gotten four years ago, before North Korea tested a nuclear bomb. If the agreement holds — pacts with North Korea have a history of falling through — it could put the United States andJapanon a path toward normalizing relations with the isolated nation, which President Bush identified as part of an “axis of evil” in 2002, and which tested a nuclear device just four months ago. Under the pact, North Korea agreed to freeze its production of plutonium at its five-megawatt nuclear facility in Yongbyon, and to allow international inspectors to monitor and verify its compliance. In return, the United States, China, South Korea and Russia agreed to provide North Korea with food and fuel aid. The pact kicks down the road three much tougher issues: complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula; a complete declaration from North Korea of all its nuclear activities; and the future of North Korea’s existing plutonium program. The North would for now hold on to an arsenal that American intelligence officials say may contain as many as a half-dozen nuclear bombs or the fuel to make them. Still, the deal represented a bureaucratic victory for Secretary of StateCondoleezza Rice, who has pushed for a more diplomatic approach with North Korea than more hawkish administration officials would have liked. In the end, it was Ms. Rice who convinced President Bush to sign onto the pact, administration officials said. “These talks represent the best opportunity to use diplomacy to address North Korea’s nuclear programs,” President Bush said in a statement Tuesday morning. “They reflect the common commitment of the participants to a Korean Peninsula that is free of nuclear weapons.” The broad criticism demonstrated the awkward place in which the administration has found itself on North Korea. Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, said  the deal “takes us back to the future.” “The good news is that it freezes in place North Korea’s nuclear program,” said Mr. Biden, who has declared his intention to run for president. “The bad news is that North Korea’s program is more dangerous to us now than it was in 2002, when President Bush rejected virtually the same deal he is now embracing.” From the other end of the spectrum, John R. Bolton, who until December served under Ms. Rice as the United States ambassador to the United Nations, criticized the pact as too weak, telling CNN that it “contradicts fundamental premises” of the administration’s approach to North Korea during the past six years. Mr. Bolton, when in the administration, had argued in favor of a hard-line approach to North Korea. Asked if she thought there was any substance to Mr. Bolton’s criticism, Ms. Rice said at a news conference in Washington on Tuesday: “No, I don’t.” She added: “I just think he’s wrong.” According to administration officials, a turning point came on Jan. 17, when Ms. Rice met in Berlin with Christopher R. Hill, an assistant secretary of state who has been the lead American negotiator with North Korea. Mr. Hill was in Germany for meetings with the North Korean representatives; Ms. Rice was making a stop there on her way home from talks with Arab leaders in Kuwait. According to the officials’ account, Mr. Hill gave Ms. Rice a one-page description of what the North Koreans had agreed to do. Ms. Rice made two telephone calls to Washington — first to Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser, and then to President Bush. “Do you think we should proceed on this basis?” Ms. Rice asked President Bush. His reply was yes, the administration officials said. Still, in the intense negotiations in Beijing that followed, the agreement seemed on the verge of collapse several times, as North Korea sought more aid. So fragile was the tentative accord reached  Monday that Ms. Rice said she called Mr. Hill in Beijing, at 4:15 A.M. Tuesday in Washington, to make sure the agreement had held. Under the deal, the United States and its partner nations agreed to provide roughly $400 million in various kinds of aid in return for the North starting a permanent disabling of its nuclear facilities and allowing inspectors into the country. In return, the United States agreed to begin the process of removing North Korea from its designation as a terror-sponsoring state, a step that is bound to meet opposition in Congress. The United States also agreed to discuss with the North, within 30 days, terms for ending financial sanctions. Of the five countries negotiating with North Korea, Japan — which had been seeking a tougher stance — did not agree to the aid package, saying that it first needs to work out the issue of North Korea’s past abductions of Japanese citizens. But Japan joined the United States in agreeing to discuss normalizing relations with North Korea, another potentially big step that could begin when Ms. Rice sits down for a meeting with her North Korean counterpart in 60 days as part of a next set of meetings mandated by the pact. Some experts previously critical of the Bush administration approach praised the accord as a turn to the pragmatic. “We were in a weak bargaining position and the Bush administration deserves credit for achieving a more limited agreement, rather than holding out for a more maximalist, but unachievable, objective,” said Gary Samore, a North Korea expert at the Council on Foreign Relations who helped to negotiate a 1994 agreement the Clinton administration struck with the North. For her part, Ms. Rice contended that under the terms of the agreement, 50,000 tons of heavy fuel oil which North Korea would receive in the first 60 days was an “actually modest” amount; another 950,000 tons of heavy fuel oil would not be forwarded to North Korea until it disabled the reactor and declared all its nuclear programs. Experts who have followed the long haggling over the North Korean program said there are bound to be problems when the time comes for the North  to disclose all of its nuclear facilities and dismantle its program. In perhaps a sign of things to come, North Korea’s state press agency released a statement that described the Yongbyon shutdown as a “temporary suspension.” In Beijing, Mr. Hill responded quickly. “The North Koreans agreed to shut down their reactors and seal them for the purpose of abandoning them,” he said. “Any action to restart the reactors would be a violation of the agreement.”

BEIJING — Much as in the children’s book “Where’s Waldo?” the proof thatNorth Korea’s leader,Kim Jong-il, is indeed traveling throughChinacan be obvious, if somewhat headache-inducing to arrive at. The quest usually begins with a rumor, followed shortly by the unmistakable sight of the Dear Leader’s bulletproof train edging across the Yalu River bridge, the curtains safely drawn as its cars creep into the Chinese city of Dandong from North Korea. In the days that follow, there are unconfirmed sightings, grainy images of Mr. Kim’s buoyant coif shot by South Korean or Japanese television cameras, and the inevitable poker-faced obfuscations by Chinese officials. Only after Mr. Kim has safely returned to Pyongyang, North Korea’s capital,  do both governments announce that the clandestine visit took place at all. What would be Mr. Kim’s fifth visit, which may or may not have started at dawn Monday, has been no different. On Tuesday, Jiang Yu, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman,brushed off reporters’ inquiriesabout putative sightings of Mr. Kim. “On this issue in which you are very interested, at present I don’t have any information to offer you,” she finally said. But the effort to conceal the rare journey by Mr. Kim outside his diplomatically isolated and economically devastated country has not gone so well this time. Despite an aggressive offense by Chinese police officers who detained several camera operators at one stop and asked them to erase images of their quarry, foreign journalists have managed to track Mr. Kim’s  movements from a luxury hotel and a car factory in the port city of Dalian to the official state guest house in Beijing where President Richard M. Nixon once stayed. Even if the passengers were hidden behind tinted glass, a motorcade of three dozen vehicles that stopped traffic in the heart of the Chinese capital on Wednesday afternoon was a sign that someone important was in town. Along the way, photographers have captured images of Mr. Kim’s thinning hair, the oversize designer sunglasses and the unmistakable dragging of his left leg, seemingly irrefutable proof that the 68-year-old leader is still grappling with the effects ofa stroke he reportedly had two years ago. If the Chinese-language media have avoided any mention of the visit, it is thought to be at the behest of Mr. Kim, whose fears of coups or assassination attempts are well known. On his way back home from a China visit in 2004,an explosion killed at least 180 peopleat a railroad station in North Korea not long after his entourage had gone through. Even if South Korean analysts later judged the blast  an accident, Mr. Kim’s minders take no chances and often send out decoy trains to confuse would-be saboteurs. “His security team may be opposed to him flying because if something happens, there is no replacing Kim Jong-il at the moment,” said Haksoon Paik, director of inter-Korean relations at the Sejong Institute in Seoul, South Korea. “He is all they have.” In the vacuum of official information, the experts and tea-leaf readers have been left to surmise why Mr. Kim chose this moment to venture outside North Korea in more than four years. Does President Hu Jintao want to personally prod Mr. Kim to rejoin the stalled talks over the North’s illicitnuclear weaponsprogram? Or has the North Korean leader simply come, once again, seeking the Chinese food and fuel that will ease his people’s suffering? Some analysts think Mr. Kim may be seeking China’s blessing fora succession planthat would install his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, as the country’s next leader. “Maybe he wanted Chinese leaders to see how he drags his foot so they know he is really ill,” said Sang-Hyun Lee, director of the security studies program at the Sejong Institute. Given his health woes, succession worries and persistent isolation, Mr. Kim may simply be seeking succor from what may be his last friend on earth. Su Hao, a professor at China Foreign Affairs University, said the North Korean leader might have also come to explain whether his country played a role inthe sinking of a South Korean military vesselin March that killed 46 sailors. The incident, which has enraged South Koreans, could derail any effort to restart the six-party talks on nuclear weapons and ease the United Nations sanctions that have strangled North Korea’s already ailing economy. “I think the situation for North Korea right now is complicated and difficult,” Mr. Su said. “I’m sure the outside world does not want China to abandon North Korea at this moment. It would not be good for anybody.” At the five-star Furama Hotel in Dalian where Mr. Kim was photographed leaving on Monday — and where white sheets had obscured the lobby windows — things were returning to normal on Wednesday. In a brief telephone conversation, an employee said the hotel’s 626 rooms were open to the public again. All except for one: the presidential suite reputedly occupied by Mr. Kim. “That room is not available,” the woman said mysteriously. “It’s under maintenance.”

Now in Pyongyang as a cellist with the New York Philharmonic, Valentin Hirsu is asking about the fate of three Korean boys from his music school in Romania.
==::==
2008-02-26T00:00:00Z
==::==
PYONGYANG,North Korea— For much of his 60 years, Valentin Hirsu has thought of those three Korean boys in his class. It was at Music School No. 1 in Bucharest,Romania. The boys were North Korean orphans from the war that had torn up their country. One played piano, another clarinet, the third flute. After about six years, they were taken home. Mr. Hirsu never heard from them again. Now, in Pyongyang as a cellist with the visitingNew York Philharmonic, he is asking about their fate. “It’s a crime not to look for them if I’ll be there,” he said on the eve of the orchestra’s departure from Beijing. “I don’t know if they are alive or minister of culture. How am I supposed to know?” he said. Mr. Hirsu kept a  picture that includes the three Koreans among a clutch of students around a teacher, like a “mother hen,” he said. He recalled the three boys  as excellent students and good kids. “They were the best in drawing,” he said. “They were the best in geography, even Romanian, volleyball, everything.” After graduating, Mr. Hirsu embarked on a successful career as a soloist in Romania. In 1975, he immigrated to Israel and a year later to the United States, where he almost immediately won an audition for the Philharmonic. Mr. Hirsu gave the photograph to Fred Carriere, the executive director of the Korea Society, which helped the Philharmonic with logistics for the trip. Mr. Hirsu had a phonetic recollection of the names, but that did not prove to be much help.  Mr. Carriere said Monday, after the orchestra arrived in Pyongyang, that he had had no success in locating the three.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 20 — President Bush pointedly declined on Thursday to discuss an Israeli airstrike in northernSyriaon Sept. 6 that Israeli officials say hit a nuclear-related facility thatNorth Koreawas helping to equip. Mr. Bush did, however, warn North Korea that the United States expected it to dismantle its nuclear weapons programs and to stop selling weapons or expertise abroad, as it promised to do this year. He emphasized that he was speaking generally, not specifically, about whether North Korea provided assistance to Syria. “I’m not going to comment on the matter,” Mr. Bush repeated twice when asked about the strike at a news conference at the White House. When pressed, he added, “Saying I’m not going to comment on the matter means I’m not going to comment on the matter.” Mr. Bush’s remarks — a relatively rare instance of a president flatly declining to comment — also reflected the extraordinary secrecy here in Washington surrounding the raid. Most details of what was struck, where, and how remain shrouded in official silence. A day earlier, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli opposition leader and former prime minister, became the first public figure inIsraelto acknowledge that an attack even took place. Until now the only public information about the raid has been a muted and vague diplomatic protest from Syria that Israel had violated its airspace and a condemnation by North Korea’s Foreign Ministry of what it called “a very dangerous provocation.” In a television interview on Wednesday evening, Mr. Netanyahu said: “When the prime minister takes action in important and necessary matters, and generally when the government is doing things for the security of Israel, I give it my endorsement. I was party to this matter, I must say, from the first minute, and I gave it my backing, but it is still too early to discuss this subject.” Mr. Netanyahu faced criticism for saying as much as he did. One former diplomat who has spoken to Israelis involved in the decision to attack said the airstrike was aimed at what Israel believed to be a Syrian nuclear program in cooperation with North Korea. The two countries already have a relationship that has concentrated on missile technology, which North Korea has long exported. The former diplomat, along with current and former American and Israeli officials, said a shipment of North Korean material labeled as cement  arrived by ship three days before the attack. That material was transferred to a facility, which Israel bombed. Current and former American and Israeli officials have said the Israelis gave the Bush administration advance notice of the attack. North Korea’s public reaction prompted speculation about a possible link to the Syrian target, though whether the target involved nuclear activity, missiles or something else remained unknown to all but a handful of officials briefed on what had happened. This week China abruptly canceled a new round of diplomatic talks that had been planned to discuss a schedule for disbanding North Korea’s nuclear facilities under a deal negotiated in February. It is not clear when those talks may resume. Mr. Bush said Thursday that the United States expected the North Koreans “to honor their commitment to give up weapons and weapons programs, and to the extent that they are proliferating, we expect them to stop that proliferation.” Some current and former American officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because information about the raid remained classified, said they believed that the site was involved in Syria’s missile program. They said that Israeli intelligence officials believed that they had evidence that the activity at the site involved North Korean engineers believed to work in the nuclear program. So far, several current and former American officials who have been involved in evaluating the Israeli claims say they are not yet convinced of a nuclear connection. Yet the enormous secrecy around the findings, both here and in Israel, suggests that the activity that prompted the Israeli attack involved “more than a run-of-the-mill missile transaction,” one official said, noting that the Israelis took considerable risks in carrying out the attack. “The Israelis are very proud of what they are doing; they are boasting about it,” said one senior American official who has been dealing with Israeli officials. “But we don’t know enough yet about what they actually hit.” In Israel, military censors have prohibited the press from reporting any details, while Prime Minister Ehud  Olmert’s government has succeeded in remaining silent about the raid. The head of Israel’s military intelligence, Gen. Amos Yadlin, appeared to refer to the matter obliquely when he told the cabinet that Israel had “restored its deterrence” in the region. The deputy chairman of the Israel Atomic Energy Commission, Gideon Frank, warned delegates at the International Atomic Energy Agency on Wednesday in Vienna that Israel could not ignore the efforts of various countries in the Middle East to develop weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. “We can hardly remain oblivious to intensive efforts by some in our region to develop W.M.D. and their means of delivery, accompanied by sustained denial of the very legitimacy of our sovereign existence and calls for our destruction,” Mr. Frank said in remarks that were interpreted to refer to Syria, as well as to Iran.

Both beset by huge problems, George W. Bush and Kim Jong-il needed some kind of breakthrough.
==::==

==::==
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13 — It is hard to imagine that eitherGeorge W. BushorKim Jong-ilwould have agreed even a year ago to the kind of deal they have now approved. The pact, announced Tuesday, would stop, seal and ultimately disableNorth Korea’s nuclear facilities, as part of a grand bargain that the administration has previously shunned as overly generous to a repressive country — especially one that has not yet said when or if it will give up its nuclear arsenal. But in the past few months, the world has changed for both Mr. Bush and Mr. Kim, two men who have made clear how deeply they detest each other. Both are beset by huge problems, and both needed some kind of breakthrough. For Mr. Bush, bogged down inIraq, his authority undercut by the November elections, any chance to show progress in peacefully disarming a country that detonated a nuclear test just four months ago could no longer be passed up. As one senior administration official said over the weekend, the prospect that Mr. Bush might leave Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and North Korea more dangerous places than he found them “can’t be very appealing.” Still, the accordcame under fast criticismfrom right and left that it was both too little and too late. For years, Mr. Bush’s administration has been paralyzed by an ideological war, between those who wanted to bring down North Korea and those who thought it was worth one more try to lure the country out of isolation. In embracing this deal, Mr. Bush sided with those who have counseled engagement, notably his secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, and her chief negotiator, Christopher R. Hill. Mr. Bush took the leap in the hope that in a few months, he will be able to declare that North Korea can no longer produce fuel for new nuclear weapons, even if it has not yet turned over its old ones. For Mr. Kim, the nuclear explosion — more of a fizzle — that he set off in the mountains not far from the Chinese border in October turned out to be a strategic mistake. The Chinese, who spent six decades protecting the Kim family dynasty, responded by cutting off his military aid, and helping Washington crack down on the banks that financed the Cognac-and-Mercedes lifestyle of the North Korean leadership. “As a political statement, their test was a red flare for everyone,” said Robert Gallucci, who under President Clinton was the chief negotiator of the 1994 agreement with North Korea, which collapsed four years ago. “It gave President Bush and the Chinese some leverage.” Mr. Gallucci and other nuclear experts agree that the hardest bargaining with world’s most reclusive, often paranoid, government remains ahead. Over the next year, under the pact, the North must not only disable its nuclear reactors and reprocessing facilities, it must lead inspectors to its weapons and a suspected second nuclear weapons program. And to get to the next phase of the agreement, the one that gives “disarmament” meaning, North Korea will have to be persuaded to give away the country’s crown jewels: the weapons that make the world pay attention to it. But before the administration faces off against Mr. Kim in Pyongyang, it will have to confront the many critics of the deal here at home. As the White House took credit on Tuesday for what it called a “first step,” it found itself pilloried by conservatives who attacked the administration for folding in negotiations with a charter member of what Mr. Bush called the “axis of evil,” and for replicating key elements of Mr.  Clinton’s agreement with North Korea. At the same time, Mr. Bush’s advisers were being confronted by barbs from veterans of the Clinton administration, who argued that the same deal struck Tuesday had been within reach several years and a half-dozen weapons ago, had only Mr. Bush chosen to negotiate with the North rather than fixate on upending its government. In fact, elements of the new decision closely resemble the Clinton deal, called the Agreed Framework. As it did in that accord, the North agrees to “freeze” its operations at Yongbyon, its main nuclear facility, and to allow inspections there. And like that agreement, the new one envisions the North’s ultimately giving up all of its nuclear material. In two respects, however, the new accord is different: North Korea does not receive the incentives the West has offered — in this case, about a year’s supply of heavy fuel oil and other aid — until it “disables” its equipment at Yongbyon and declares where it has hidden its bombs, nuclear fuel and other nuclear facilities. And the deal is not only with Washington, but with Beijing, Moscow, Seoul and Tokyo. “We’re building a set of relationships,” Ms. Rice argued Tuesday, saying that the deal would not have been possible if she and President Bush had not been able to swing the Chinese over to their side. Mr. Bush has told colleagues that he believes the turning point came in his own blunt conversations with President Hu Jintao of China, in which, the American president has said, he explained in stark terms that a nuclear North Korea was more China’s problem than America’s. But the administration was clearly taken aback on Tuesday by the harshness of the critique from the right, led by its recently departed United Nations ambassador, John R. Bolton, who charged that the deal “undercuts the sanctions resolution” against the North that he pushed through the Security Council four months ago. Democrats, in contrast, were caught between enjoying watching Mr. Bush change course and declaring that the agreement amounted to disarmament-lite. “It gives the illusion of moving more rapidly to disarmament, but it doesn’t really require anything to happen in the second phase,” said Joel Wit, who was the coordinator of the 1994 agreement. The Bush administration is counting on the lure of future benefits to the North — fuel oil, the peace treaty ending the Korean War it has long craved, an end to other sanctions — to force Mr. Kim to disclose where his nuclear weapons and fuel are stored. Mr. Bush’s big worry now is that Mr. Kim is playing the administration for time. Many experts think he is betting that by the time the first big deliveries of oil and aid are depleted, America will be distracted by a presidential election. But Mr. Bush could also end up with a diplomatic triumph, one he needs desperately. To get there, he appears to have changed course. Asked in 2004 about North Korea, he said, “I don’t think you give timelines to dictators and tyrants.” Now he appears to have concluded that sometimes the United States has to negotiate with dictators and odious rulers, because  the other options — military force, sanctions or watching an unpredictable nation gain a nuclear arsenal — seem even worse.

A visit to Pyongyang shows that many Koreans know that self-reliance is no longer enough.
==::==
2010-11-06T00:00:00Z
==::==
The North Korean state has been constructed on the ideology ofjuche— total self reliance: “Man is the master of everything and decides everything.” And, in the heart of Pyongyang, on the banks of the city’s Taedong River, opposite Kim Il-sung Square, stands the Juche Tower. Completed in 1982, to celebrate Kim Il-sung’s 70th birthday, at  558 feet the tower stands marginally taller than the Washington Monument, on which is appears to be modeled. Last week, during my third visit to North Korea, I was taken to see the tower. Perhaps symbolizing both the condition of North Korea’s economy, and its desperate need for more than self-reliance, my embarrassed guide explained that we could not ascend, as debris was falling from within, onto the elevator. The situation, he explained, was very dangerous — it seemed an appropriately graphic metaphor. No nation wants to be in thrall to others, especially one that experienced half a century of Japanese occupation But isolation has not served North Korea well. Beyond the sloganeering rhetoric and braggadocio is a nation that senses change in the air. The Soviet model is discredited; the country’s powerful neighbor, China, is in the throes of a liberalizing revolution; and North Koreans know that self-reliance will not be enough. Senior officials, including the chairman of the Supreme People’s Assembly, Choe Thae Bok, insisted to me that over the next two years the new priorities will be “prosperity and dignity,” with a “unified, denuclearized Korea” as their first objective. The West should listen carefully and respond appropriately. The alternative doesn’t bear thinking about. This year is the 60th anniversary of the start of the Korean War, which killed an estimated 2 million Koreans, almost 38,000 American and U.N. soldiers, and 600,000 Chinese. Since the 1953 armistice there have been intermittent spats and skirmishes — some, like the sinking in March of the South Korean vessel, Cheonan, with loss of life; others, like the shots fired across the border last week, bellicose saber-rattling. For nearly 60 years there has been neither war nor peace — merely a shaky armistice. The United States has no diplomatic presence, although Britain opened an embassy a decade ago. A new peace conference, perhaps jointly convened by Switzerland and Britain and held in Beijing, could enable the North and South to conclude a formal peace treaty. This would put new life into the six-party talks on denuclearization. Throughout the Cold War, the West countered Soviet aggression with formidable defenses. Simultaneously, through the Helsinki Process, Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan elevated discourse on human rights. Through engagement they encouraged economic and political reform. Today on the Korean Peninsula we need Helsinki, with a Korean face. Over the past seven years I have continually raised the issues of political and religious freedom and human rights with the North Koreans. Last week, I once again urged them to address widespread concerns over public executions, torture, child labor, trafficking of women, and religious persecution. Their response, of course, was to deny the very existence of prison camps and the associated violations, but at least they heard the concerns and can have no doubt about international opinion. I left them copies of U.N. and Human Rights Watch reports, urged them to open their prisons to international monitors and to invite the new special rapporteur for human rights in North Korea, the former Indonesian Attorney General Marzuki Darusman, to visit the country. They refused to cooperate with his predecessor; now they have an opportunity to start afresh. Without a  Helsinki-style approach there will be no progress,  whereas attempting to talk stands a chance of sowing some seeds of change. I have witnessed some modest developments. According to the United Nations, about 300,000 people languish in North Korean prison camps, many because of their religious convictions. Yet, despite persecution, Korean Christians are in the vanguard of engagement. One example of this is the new Pyongyang University of Science and Technology established by Dr. James Chin Kyung Kim, a Korean-American entrepreneur who fought the North as a teenage soldier, and later vowed to work for peace and reconciliation. The university is the country’s first privately funded international institution, with staff members drawn from Europe, China and North America. Men like James Kim represent the way in which North Korean citizens can engage in our global society and help their country move on. There is no alternative. To ignore a crumbling structure — as the debris falling from within the Juche Tower illustrates, is to create an even more dangerous situation.

Wildlife authorities inZimbabweon Wednesday defended the decision to sell two baby elephants and other animals toNorth Korea, and they said veterinary experts were satisfied that North Korea was equipped to care for them. The two 18-month-old elephants each cost $10,000. Officials said the other animals purchased by the North included breeding pairs of giraffes, zebras, antelopes, hyenas, monkeys and birds. Vitalis Chadenga, the head of the wildlife department, called the deal “purely a business arrangement” for financially struggling Zimbabwe; he said it involved surplus species in the western Hwange National Park. But Johnny Rodrigues, the head of the independent Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force, criticized the arrangement. “We understand North Korea does not have a good record in animal rights,” he said.

Nikolai Makarov, the chief ofRussia’s general staff, said during a visit to Mongolia on Wednesday. Moscow has stepped up its criticism ofNorth Koreasince May, when the Northcarried out an underground nuclear test, though Russian officials stopped short of endorsing the toughest sanctions favored by Washington. General Makarov told the Interfax news service that a battalion equipped with an antimissile system was already deployed near Russia’s short border with North Korea. “We are concerned by the fact that the site in North Korea, where it carries out its nuclear tests, is located quite close to the Russian border,” he said.

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton voiced concern about what she called signs of military cooperation.

BANGKOK — Secretary of StateHillary Rodham Clinton, in Thailand for a meeting of Southeast Asian nations, expressed concern on Wednesday that North Korea was transferring nuclear technology to Myanmar, which she said could destabilize the region. “It’s a threat to other of our allies,” Mrs. Clinton said during a town hall meeting here, “and it’s a threat to further destabilization of the region.” A day earlier, she said that expanded military ties between the countries would “pose a direct threat” to Myanmar’s neighbors. She singled out Thailand, the host of the regional security meeting, as being vulnerable to the reclusive and heavily armed dictatorship in Myanmar. Suspicions aboutNorth Korea’s relationship with Myanmardeepened recently when aNorth Korean freighter appeared to be steaming toward Myanmar. American officials, believing the ship might be carrying weapons or other illicit cargo, tracked it until it reversed course. North Korea is already suspected of supplying Myanmar with small-caliber weapons and ammunition, but some intelligence analysts contend that North Korea is also helping Myanmar pursue anuclear weaponsprogram. They cite as possible evidence newly publishedphotosof what some analysts say is a network of giant tunnels outside Myanmar’s jungle capital, Naypyidaw, built with help from North Korean engineers. “North Korea has been a notorious proliferator of nuclear technology,” Mrs. Clinton said on Wednesday. Even without these links, Myanmar and North Korea are likely to dominatethe meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, which begins Wednesday on the resort island of Phuket. Mrs. Clinton plans to meet with the foreign ministers of several countries to strengthen support forthe latest United Nations resolutionagainst North Korea, adopted after that country’s nuclear and missile tests. Although the United States is putting most of its emphasis on enforcing the sanctions in that resolution, it has begun discussing possible incentives that the countries could offer North Korea, if its government agreed to abandon its nuclear ambitions and return to the bargaining table. Officials declined to say what might be on the table, though they said it would be a mix of familiar and new elements. In the past, the United States and other countries have offered North Korea shipments of fuel. “There are obviously a list of incentives, offers that could be made if the North Koreans evidence any willingness to take a different path,” Mrs. Clinton said at a news conference here, after arriving from New Delhi. “As of this moment in time, we haven’t seen that evidence.” The administration’s decision to broach the possibility of incentives, officials said, will make it easier to persuade countries like China, which have previously resisted sanctions against North Korea, to agree to put into effect the tougher measures in the United Nations resolution. North Korea is expected to send a delegate to the Asean conference, but Mrs. Clinton did not plan to meet that delegate. American officials said there was always the possibility of a chance encounter of a North Korean diplomat and one of Mrs. Clinton’s lieutenants on the sidelines. Mrs. Clinton also has no plans to meet with a representative from Myanmar, formerly Burma. On Tuesday, she spoke in unusually detailed terms in discussing the country’s human rights record and its treatment of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the pro-democracy leader. Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi is on trial, accused of violating her house arrest by sheltering an American man who swam across a lake to her bungalow last May. “We are deeply concerned by the reports of continuing human rights abuses within Burma,” she said, “and particularly by actions that are attributed to the Burmese military, concerning the mistreatment and abuse of young girls.” The Obama administration has been reviewing American policy toward Myanmar since February, when Mrs. Clinton declared that the existing sanctions against its military-run government had been ineffective. But the United States will not announce a new policy at this meeting, American officials said, largely because repeated delays in the trial of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi have made it difficult for the administration to develop a response. Mrs. Clinton repeated her demand that Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi be treated fairly, and dismissed the charges against her as “baseless and totally unacceptable.” “Our position is that we are willing to have a more productive partnership with Burma if they take steps that are self-evident,” she said. She called on the government to release political prisoners and to “end the violence” against its own people, including ethnic minorities. In recent weeks, the military has carried out a fierce offensive against the Karen minority, driving refugees across the border into Thailand. Chinese and American officials have pressed Myanmar to adhere to the anti-proliferation measures in the sanctions against North Korea, which it has pledged to do. Analysts say there is evidence, in the aborted voyage of the North Korean freighter, that the leaders got the message. Without a new American policy to announce, however, the United States and Asian nations are unlikely to break much ground in trying to bring the generals who govern Myanmar back into the fold. Appearing with Mrs. Clinton, one of Thailand’s deputy prime ministers, Korbsak Sabhavasu, said, “I think we basically almost just about share the same thoughts and ideas on how to solve this problem.”

To destroy any debris from a North Korean rocket launch, Tokyo will deploy missile interceptors and dispatch two warships, the defense minister said.

TOKYO —Japanauthorized its military on Friday to destroy any debris from a North Korean rocket that might fall on its territory.North Koreahas said it intends to put a satellite into orbit as early as next week, and warned that fragments could fall into waters off northern Japan. Japan, South Korea and the United States suspect the launching is a cover for a test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, theTaepodong-2. In response, Japan will deploy missile interceptors and dispatch two warships to the waters between it and the Korean Peninsula, said the Japanese defense minister, Yasukazu Hamada. A battery ofPatriot land-to-air missileswill also be deployed in Tokyo, he said. “Whether it’s a satellite or a missile, we are extremely uncomfortable with the object flying over Japanese territory,” Mr. Hamada said. The government spokesman, Takeo Kawamura, called for calm on Friday, saying it was unlikely that debris would fall on Japan. Tension mounted this week after reports that a rocket was being prepared at a launching pad near North Korea’s northeastern coast. The North has announced that a test would be conducted between April 4 and 8. A United Nations Security Council resolution bans North Korea from testing missiles and nuclear devices. Japan, among other nations, imposed tight trade sanctions on North Korea in 2006 after it test-fired a missile and conducted a nuclear test. The United States, Japan and their allies have also demanded that the North cancel the test, and have threatened stricter international sanctions. Even a satellite launching would violate a United Nations Security Council resolution prohibiting ballistic activity, they say. Also on Friday, Russia joined the chorus of nations condemning the coming launching. “We understand that the current situation in the region of Northeast Asia is tense, and this is why it would be better if our partners in North Korea abstained from this, from this launch,” the Russian deputy foreign minister, Aleksei Borodavkin, told journalists, according to Reuters. A successful test by North Korea would demonstrate that it has the technology to launch a missile that could travel as far as the western United States.

The agent, Kim Hyon Hui, met with relatives of a Japanese woman abducted to North Korea in 1978, but she shed little new light on the fate of the Japanese woman.

SEOUL — A notorious former North Korean spy who confessed to a passenger-jet bombing   in 1987 met Wednesday with relatives of a Japanese woman abducted byNorth Korea30 years ago,  in an encounter that shed little of the hoped-for  light on the missing woman’s  fate  but was expected to increase already rising tensions with Pyongyang. The abducted woman had tutored the female spy in Japanese language and culture, enabling the spy to pose as a Japanese tourist and plant the bomb. The ensuing crash killed 115 people, most of them South Koreans. The spy, Kim Hyon-hui, was sentenced to death in the case but eventually pardoned and used in propaganda against the North. She has lived in seclusion for many years. The meeting was her  first public appearance  in almost 20 years and drew intense news coverage inJapanand South Korea. In Tokyo, the government of Prime MinisterTaro Asosaid it helped arrange the meeting in the hope that Ms. Kim might provide fresh information about the woman who tutored her,  Yaeko Taguchi, that could be used to press the North Korean government on other cases.  In 2002, North Korea admitted to kidnapping 13 Japanese citizens to help train its spies. It allowed five to return to Japan that year but said the others had died — an assertion Tokyo has not accepted. But on Wednesday, Ms. Kim, 47, delivered no new information. At a news conference in the southern city of Busan, she said that she had “heard” in 1987 that Ms. Taguchi had been “sent somewhere” and that she had “assumed” at the time that she was still alive. But she did not refute the North Korean claim that Ms. Taguchi had died in a car accident in 1986. Still, Koichiro Iizuka, Ms. Taguchi’s 32-year-old son, said after  meeting Ms. Kim that he was convinced his mother was alive. Ms. Kim also used the occasion to try  to dispel years of speculation about her identity by stressing that she was indeed an agent who planted the bomb on a Korean Air Boeing 707, which  exploded near Myanmar and killed all aboard. “I am not a fake,” she said. “It was an act of terror by North Korea.” She and an accomplice were apprehended in Bahrain, after they had planted the bomb and left the flight. Both took poison; only Ms. Kim survived. She was extradited to South Korea, where she was sentenced to death, but leaders in Seoul pardoned her and portrayed her as an innocent duped by the North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, into attempting to disrupt the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Ms. Kim eventually married a South Korean intelligence officer who had investigated her and has written several best-selling books. By late Wednesday, there was no reaction from North Korea about Ms. Kim’s appearance, but analysts predicted that the public reminder of that incident and the abductions would irritate Pyongyang. “This meeting is not good for North Korea-Japan relations,“ said Kim Yong-hyun, a North Korea expert at Dongguk University in Seoul. Also, he said, “this is not good for South Korea-North Korea relations.”

President Bush’s move to consider a “time horizon” for Iraq troop withdrawals put John McCain on the defensive.
==::==
2008-07-26T00:00:00Z
==::==
WASHINGTON — President Bush and SenatorJohn McCainhave long been in agreement on major elements of American foreign policy, particularly in their approach to the “axis of evil” countries ofIranandNorth Korea, and their commitment to staying the course inIraq. But now the administration’s agreement to consider a “time horizon” for troop withdrawals from Iraq has moved it, at least in the public perception, in the direction of the policies of Senator Barack Obama. That has thrown Mr. McCain on the political defensive in his opposition to a timed withdrawal, Republicans in the party’s foreign party establishment say. On Friday Mr. McCain went so far as to say that the idea of a 16-month withdrawal, which Mr. Obama supports, was “a pretty good timetable,” although he included the caveat that it had to be based on conditions on the ground. Republicans also say the administration’s decision to authorize high-level talks with Iran and North Korea has undercut Mr. McCain’s skepticism about engagement with those countries, leaving the perception that he is more conservative than Mr. Bush on the issue. Essentially, as the administration has taken a more pragmatic approach to foreign policy, the decision of Mr. McCain to adhere to his more hawkish positions illustrates the continuing influence of neoconservatives on his thinking even as they are losing clout within the administration. Whether the perception of Mr. McCain as being at odds with the administration is politically advantageous for him is a matter of debate among his supporters, but many of his more conservative advisers do not think it is a bad thing. “There’s no doubt, particularly as Bush has adopted policies in the direction of Obama, that that gives Obama bragging rights,” said John R. Bolton, the Bush administration’s former ambassador to the United Nations, who has sharply criticized the administration’s talks with Iran and North Korea. “But if you believe as I do that this administration is in the midst of an intellectual collapse, it doesn’t hurt McCain. Occasionally in politics it helps to be right.” But other Republicans — the so-called foreign policy pragmatists, many of whom have come to view the Iraq war as a mistake — say the administration’s policy shifts highlight the more confrontational nature of Mr. McCain’s foreign policy, particularly in his approach toward Russia and his embrace on Friday of the Dalai Lama, whom the Chinese regard as the fomenter of a rebellion in Tibet. They say the meeting will only antagonize China before the Summer Olympics, and at a moment when the United States is seeking its cooperation on economic issues and negotiations with North Korea. The divisions within the Republican foreign policy establishment continue at a time when Mr. Obama is trying to establish his own international credentials. Republicans worry that he is seizing the chance, helped with the boost from Mr. Bush, to command the American foreign policy stage. “Bush and Obama seem to be setting the foreign policy agenda, and McCain seems to be reacting,” said Kenneth M. Duberstein, a chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan. The McCain campaign disputes the idea that Mr. McCain has been left out on his own by the president. “Does he feel he had the rug pulled out from under him by Bush?” said Randy Scheunemann, Mr. McCain’s chief foreign policy aide. “Absolutely not. John McCain has always said that he wanted the troops to come home. But he is opposed to an artificial date-driven timetable that ignores conditions on the ground and the advice of military commanders.” In fact, Mr. Bush’s decision to accept a “general time horizon” for withdrawal from Iraq is still a long way from Mr. Obama’s proposal for a phased pullout, as the administration has not set any timeline. Mr. McCain has on several recent occasions envisioned a date by when most American troops in Iraq would leave, although he has refused to call it a timetable. In a speech in Ohio in May, he declared that most American troops would be home by 2013. On Monday, in remarks at the side of the first President George Bush in Kennebunkport, Me., Mr. McCain embraced, if only in passing, the possibility of withdrawing most American troops by the end of 2010. On Friday on CNN, under questioning by Wolf Blitzer, he called Mr. Obama’s 16-month proposal “a pretty good timetable.” But the McCain campaign declined to elaborate Friday night on whether this represented a change in his views. Mr. McCain’s advisers also say that he is not opposed to talks with Iran and North Korea, and that he supported the administration’s decision to send the under secretary of state, William J. Burns, to Geneva last week for talks with Iran and European officials about Iran’s nuclear program. But Mr. McCain is against any president-to-president negotiations without preconditions, which Mr. Obama supports. (Mr. Obama’s advisers now say such talks would occur only if Mr. Obama deemed them potentially fruitful.) Mr. McCain’s campaign continues to be a microcosm of the ongoing Republican foreign policy battles between the pragmatists and the neoconservatives like Mr. Bolton, and it is still not clear where the balance of power lies within Mr. McCain’s inner circle. So far, however, the divide between the two within the campaign does not appear as deep as it did within the Bush White House, and advisers say Mr. McCain has been able to chose when there is a policy difference. Mr. McCain’s advisers were divided, for example, over a speech he gave on nuclear security policy in Denver in May. Two Republican pragmatists who advise Mr. McCain, the former secretaries of state Henry A. Kissinger and George P. Shultz, supported a call in the speech for a nuclear-free world, an idea they endorse as part of a “Gang of Four” of national security statesmen. But other McCain advisers, including John F. Lehman, a former Navy secretary, and Fred C. Ikle, a defense official in the Reagan administration, were opposed to the idea because, in their view, nuclear weapons act as a deterrent against an attack on the United States and its allies. In the end, Mr. Lehman said, Mr. McCain made the call in favor of a nuclear-free world. “He wanted to do it,” Mr. Lehman said. “That position is McCain’s position. It’s not a cabal of Kissingerites or a cabal of neo-cons.” But some of Mr. McCain’s pragmatist advisers remain uneasy that conservatives close to Mr. McCain — among them Mr. Scheunemann and Robert Kagan, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace — will help him mold a more bellicose message than they would like on Iran and its threat to Israel, particularly at a time when there is widespread speculation in the Israeli news media that Israeli may bomb Iran’s nuclear facilities. Others who were once uneasy about the influence of conservatives on Mr. McCain say that their worries have not been realized, even as Mr. McCain has taken conservative positions. “What I’ve seen in the campaign so far to me demonstrates that McCain is his own man, and he’s not being managed,” said Lawrence S. Eagleburger, a secretary of state under the first President Bush.

Delays in handing over about $25 million in frozen funds could derail an agreement under which North Korea would shut down a plutonium-producing reactor.

BEIJING, April 10 — The government inMacaois prepared to release funds linked toNorth Koreathat have been frozen in a local bank, the Treasury Department said Tuesday, as negotiations continued in order to meet the North’s demand that the money be returned before it begins nuclear disarmament. Delays in handing over about $25 million that has been frozen for 18 months in Banco Delta Asia, a small bank in the Chinese gambling enclave of Macao, are threatening to derail an agreement under which North Korea would shut down a plutonium-producing reactor by this weekend in exchange for economic aid. The top United States negotiator on North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, Christopher R. Hill, an assistant secretary of state, said in Seoul, South Korea,  on Tuesday that it was still possible to meet the deadline. “Let’s see how we do in the next couple of days,” Mr. Hill said, according to The Associated Press. “Obviously, it’s a very important week, and I would say a crucial couple of days.” The United States and North Korea agreed last month that the money was to be transferred to an account controlled by the North at the Bank of China in Beijing, where the Chinese government has majority ownership. But the transaction has been held up by what officials in the Bush administration said were technical difficulties. In a development that could further delay the transfer, Beijing signaled Tuesday that the Bank of China had reservations about handling funds from a bank that the United States has accused of being a “willing pawn” in money laundering and the distribution of counterfeit currency on behalf of North Korea. In a statement released in Beijing and Washington, the Treasury Department said it understood that the authorities in Macao were ready to unblock the accounts linked to North Korea at Banco Delta Asia. “Based on previous discussions with Chinese, Macanese and D.P.R.K. officials, as well as understandings reached with the D.P.R.K. on the use of these funds, the United States would support a decision by the Macao authorities to unblock the accounts in question,” the statement said, abbreviating North Korea’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The Macao Monetary Authority could not be reached for comment.

Talks over North Korea’s nuclear weapons are to resume in Beijing next week in the latest effort to curb its nuclear program.
==::==

==::==
BEIJING, Jan. 30 — China announced Tuesday that talks overNorth Korea’s nuclear weapons would resume in Beijing next week, the latest in a long series of negotiations that have failed to curb its nuclear program. Discussions are set to resume Feb. 8 though the United States and North Korea have not settled a dispute over freezing North Korean  assets at a bank in Macau, a Chinese territory. United States Treasury officials and their North Korean counterparts met Tuesday in Beijing to discuss American measures that have led to the freezing of $24 million in North Korean assets held at the bank, Banco Delta Asia. No breakthrough appeared imminent, but the talks were set to continue Wednesday. The  dispute overshadowed the last round of nuclear negotiations, which ended in a stalemate in December. Whether North Korea would bargain on its nuclear program while its money remained frozen was unclear. The United States contends that the matter is separate from the nuclear issue and  that the deposits are linked to North Korean counterfeiting and money laundering. North Korea exploded a nuclear device in October, adding a sense of urgency to six-nation talks that have dragged on for more than three years without tangible progress. Many American and Chinese analysts say they doubt North Korea will give up its nuclear arms voluntarily after spending  decades working to buy and develop the technology. But the analysts also say that the Bush administration and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, may have more to gain by continuing the talks than abandoning them, at least partly because China, the key intermediary, insists that the talks are the only way to proceed. The United States and China agreed to impose limited United Nations military sanctions on North Korea  after its nuclear test. But China has opposed tougher  penalties on North Korea, its former ally. Christopher R. Hill, an assistant secretary of state and the chief American envoy at the talks, says  the North Koreans have signaled their commitment to  a 2005 accord on dismantling their arms program. He met his North Korean counterpart, Kim Kye-gwan, in Berlin this month, and both sides said they had set the stage for a productive round.

Making good on President Bush's vow this week to hold North Korea ''fully accountable'' if it shares nuclear material will pose a major challenge to American intelligence and diplomacy, requiring new equipment and a high level of international cooperation, administration and military officials say. Mr. Bush's declaration on Monday, in his first public comments after the North announced that it had detonated a nuclear device, underscored the importance of monitoring North Korea's nuclear program, tracking its exports and investing in technology for ''fingerprinting'' nuclear materials.

More than 127,000 people were evacuated in the northeast after torrential rains.

SHANGHAI —  More than 250,000 people were evacuated in northeasternChinaover the weekend after torrential rains battered the area and led to severe flooding along the border withNorth Korea, Chinese state media reported on Monday. The government said that four people were killed and one was missing near the port city of Dandong in the northeastern province of Liaoning after some of the worst flooding to hit the region in decades. Emergency crews worked beginning Saturday into Sunday to move the estimated 253,500 people, the Xinhua news agency reported. China has been suffering from severe flooding in various parts of the country for months, and is still trying to cope with massive mudslides that killed at least 1,400 people this month in Gansu Province, in the northwestern part of the country. The heavy rains in North China over the weekend flooded the Yalu River, which separates China from North Korea, forcing the river to breach its banks, China’s state-run news media reported. In North Korea, flooding submerged much of Sinuiju. The North Korean state-run media said Sunday that the country’s leader, Kim Jong-il, had mobilized military forces to rescue and evacuate thousands of North Koreans from floods that hit Sinuiju, the isolated country’s major trading gate on its border with China. The North’s Korean Central News Agency said that about a foot of rain had fallen around Sinuiju from midnight until 9 a.m. Saturday. The agency reported “severe damage” and said that 5,150 people had been evacuated to higher ground. It reported no deaths. Sinuiju forms a vital lifeline for the North’s impoverished economy. Much of the country’s land traffic with China, its main trading partner, travels trough Sinuiju. Since the mid-1990s, North Korea’s agricultural sector has often been devastated by both floods and drought. After decades of denuding its hills for firewood, North Korea remains vulnerable to landslides and flash floods. In the Chinese province of Liaoning, the floodwaters damaged five border cities, destroying or damaging thousands of homes and buildings and causing at least $100 million in losses, the government said. The heavy rains began pounding Liaoning Province on Thursday and did not let up until Saturday. But, the government said Sunday, another wave of heavy rains was expected to worsen the situation.

SEOUL, South Korea — An American citizen arrested in January for illegally enteringNorth Koreawill be put on trial, the North’s official news agency reported Monday. The Korean Central News Agency identified the man as Aijalon Mahli Gomes, 30, of Boston, adding that he was born on June 19, 1979. “Since the related agencies have confirmed criminal evidence on him, it has been determined that he should be indicted and put on trial,” the news agency said, without offering further details. North Korea said in January that it had arrested an American citizen for illegally entering the North from China. Until now, it had not identified him. Officials at the United States Embassy in Seoul were not immediately available for comment, and the State Department could not immediately confirm his identity. In late January, the State Department said that it had asked Swedish diplomats, who represent American interests in North Korea, to contact the man now identified as Mr. Gomes. Last year, North Korea arrested two American journalists — Laura Ling and Euna Lee — and sentenced them to 12 years of hard labor for illegally entering the North. The women were pardoned and released five months later, after former President Bill Clinton visited the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, in August and met the nation’s leader, Kim Jong-il, to negotiate their release. Robert Park, a Christian missionary from Tucson, illegally entered North Korea on Dec. 25 carrying a letter urging Mr. Kim to shut down prison camps and free political prisoners. North Korea released him in early February, saying that it had decided to “leniently forgive” Mr. Park and that he had recognized his wrongdoings and repented.

In their first talk since December, Chinese and American officials discussed the growing nuclear threat in North Korea.

BEIJING — Chinese and American officials on Wednesday gave a positive assessment of their military talks aimed at addressing the growing nuclear threat fromNorth Koreaand a series of naval skirmishes that have marred relations between the countries. The two days of dialogue were the first military talks since December, whenChinabroke off annual military exchanges to protest a $6.5 billion arms deal between the United States and Taiwan, which China considers a renegade province. Although there were no measurable achievements, both sides agreed to another round of high-level military talks next month intended to ease tensions that have been heightened by China’s increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea. In the latest episode, a Chinese submarine damaged a piece of sonar equipment  being towed by an American naval ship three weeks ago. China later described the collision as an accident. During other, more aggressive confrontations this year, Chinese fishing vessels have menaced American surveillance ships during routine patrols. The United States insists that the intelligence-gathering missions are allowed under international law, an assertion that China has repeatedly challenged. China on Wednesday played down the skirmishes, saying that both countries should increase communication to minimize potential conflict. “Our two sides agreed to work together to avoid such incidents from happening again, since such incidents will surely have a negative impact on our bilateral relations in general,” Lt. Gen. Ma Xiaotian, deputy chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, said at a news conference on Wednesday. Michele Flournoy, the under secretary of defense for policy and General Ma’s American counterpart in the discussions, echoed that sentiment, saying there was no reason such “accidents” should harm relations, even if the two countries remained at odds over the definition of international waters. “We have to put the safety of mariners first and foremost,” she said in a separate news conference. During talks aboutNorth Korea’s nuclear weaponsambitions, Ms. Flournoy said Chinese military officials reiterated their support for  United Nations Security Council sanctions that seek to punish North Korea for the detonation of a nuclear device last month. “There is very much a shared objective to getting North Korea to change course and return to a verifiable path to denuclearization,” she said. This month, the Security Council unanimously passed a package of sanctions that, among other things, calls upon member states to inspect suspect ships at sea, or direct them to a nearby port if they refuse. Although General Ma described North Korea’s nuclear pursuits as a “serious concern,” he did not indicate whether China would countenance the search of the Kang Nam, a North Korean vessel en route to theStrait of Malaccathat is suspected of carrying conventional weapons. The United States Navy is monitoring the ship, which may be headed toward Myanmar, but North Korea has warned that interception would be seen as a declaration of war. Even as the two nations hailed the resumption of talks and an effort to ease longstanding mistrust, the issue of Taiwan arms sales could re-emerge as a stumbling block to increased military cooperation. Although it has made no decision, the White House is considering another round of weapons sales first proposed during the Bush administration.

The new effort to intercept North Korean ships is part of what officials described as “vigorous enforcement.”
==::==

WASHINGTON — The Obama administration will order the Navy to hail and request permission to inspect North Korean ships at sea suspected of carrying arms or nuclear technology, but will not board them by force, senior administration officials said Monday. The new effort to intercept North Korean ships, and track them to their next port, where Washington will press for the inspections they refused at sea, is part of what the officials described as “vigorous enforcement” of the United Nations Security Council resolution approved Friday. The planned American action stops just short of the forced inspections thatNorth Koreahas said that it would regard as an act of war. Still, the administration’s plans, if fully executed, would amount to the most confrontational approach taken by the United States in dealing with North Korea in years, and carries a risk of escalating tensions at a time when North Korea has been carrying out missile and nuclear tests. In discussing President Obama’s strategy on Monday, administration officials said that the United States would report any ship that refused inspection to the Security Council. While the Navy and American intelligence agencies continued to track the ship, the administration would mount a vigorous diplomatic effort to insist that the inspections be carried out by any country that allowed the vessel into port. The officials said that they believed thatChina, once a close cold war ally,  would also enforce the new sanctions, which also require countries to refuse to refuel or resupply ships suspected of carrying out arms and nuclear technology. “China will implement the resolution earnestly,” said Qin Gang, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said. One official in Washington said the administration was told by their Chinese counterparts that China “would not have signed on to this resolution unless they intended to enforce it.” The strategy of ordering ships to stop but not provoking military action by boarding them was negotiated among Washington, Beijing and Moscow. It is unclear to what degree South Korea or Japan, at various times bitter adversaries of North Korea, would order their naval forces to join in the effort to intercept suspected shipments at sea, largely because of fears about what would happen if North Korean ships opened fire. A senior administration official said Monday evening that the United States believed that it already had sufficient intelligence and naval assets in the Sea of Japan to track North Korean ships and flights. The country’s cargo fleet is relatively small, and the North is wary, officials say, of entrusting shipments banned by the United Nations to Panamanian-flagged freighters or those from other countries. Until now, American interceptions of North Korean ships have been rare. Early in the Bush administration, a shipment of missiles to Yemen was discovered, but the United States permitted the shipment to go through after the Yemenis said they had paid for the missiles and expected delivery. Under the new United Nations resolution, American officials said they now had the authority to seize such shipments. The senior administration officials outlined Mr. Obama’s approach a day before the president was to meet for the first time on Tuesday with South Korea’s president, Lee Myung-bak, a conservative who has been far more confrontational in his dealings with North Korea than most of his predecessors. The resolution authorizes nations to seek to stop suspect North Korean shipments on the high seas, but they do not authorize forcible boarding or inspections. “The captains will be confronted,” one official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was discussing a security operation that America’s key allies had only been partially briefed on. Even if they refused to allow inspections, the official said, “These guys aren’t going to get very far.” While the captain of a ship may refuse inspection, as the North Koreans almost certainly would, the Obama administration officials noted that most North Korean vessels have limited range and would have to seek out ports in search of fuel and supplies. American officials believe that previous North Korean shipments of nuclear technology and missiles have gone undetected. The North Koreans were deeply involved in the construction of a reactor in Syria until September 2007, when the reactor was destroyed in an Israeli air raid. But no ships or aircraft carrying parts for that reactor were ever found. Mr. Obama’s decisions about North Korea stem from a fundamentally different assessment of the North’s intentions than that of previous administrations. Nearly 16 years of on-and-off negotiations — punctuated by major crises in 1994 and 2003 — were based on an assumption that ultimately, the North was willing to give up its nuclear capability. A review, carried out by the Obama administration during its first month in office, concluded that North Korea had no intention of trading away what it calls its “nuclear deterrent” in return for food, fuel and security guarantees. Mr. Obama’s aides have said that while the new president is willing to re-engage in either the talks with North Korea and its neighbors, or in direct bilateral discussions, he will not agree to an incremental dismantlement of the North’s nuclear facilities. “There are ways to do this that are truly irreversible,” said one of Mr. Obama’s aides, declining to be specific. North Korea is already working to reverse the dismantlement of some of its facilities negotiated in Mr. Bush’s last days in office. In the weeks ahead of and after its second nuclear test, conducted May 25, North Korea has disavowed its past commitments to give up those weapons, and said it would never bow to the demands of the United States, its allies, or the United Nations. On Saturday the North said that it would reprocess its remaining stockpile of spent nuclear fuel into plutonium, adding to an existing stockpile believed sufficient to make six or eight weapons. Such announcements have heightened fears that North Korea’s next step could be to sell more of its nuclear or missile technology, one of the few profitable exports of a broken, starving country. The result is that Mr. Obama, in his first year in office, is putting into effect many of the harshest steps against North Korea that were advocated by conservatives in the Bush White House, including Vice President Dick Cheney. The new approach, officials said, will also exploit elements of the Security Council resolution to try to close down the subsidiaries of North Korean missile makers in China, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East, where the North has its biggest customers.

To the Editor: Re “The Trouble With Zero,” by Philip Taubman (Week in Review, May 10): All abolitionist movements, including the one to end slavery, have appeared quixotic to those invested in the status quo. The problem with nuclear weapons is that there is no stable status quo. We must radically devalue them or face a new era of proliferation, with greatly increased risk of at least regional nuclear wars or nuclear terrorism. Why do countries like North Korea and possibly Iran seek to join the nuclear club? Unless we want to fight endless wars of prevention, we have to abolish the club. The doctrine of preventive war is another reason rogue states want a nuclear deterrent. As the world’s leader in advanced conventional forces, the United States would gain from a nuclear-weapons-free world. The quest toward it would also strengthen common security and cooperation, vital to confront global warming, poverty and pandemics. Ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty would be a first step. David KeppelBloomington, Ind., May 10, 2009  To the Editor: Philip Taubman suggests that getting rid of nuclear weapons would pose the same political and military challenges that would have been involved if the great powers of the 19th century had “decided to abolish gunpowder.” But that is not the case at all. Gunpowder was a staple of warfare. Nuclear weapons serve no military purpose, and the use of even one — whether intentionally or by accident — would cause unparalleled destruction. That is why their elimination is being demanded not only by a growing roster of former diplomats, but by former secretaries of defense and retired generals as well. The task of creating a world without nuclear weapons may be difficult, but it is also essential. William D. HartungNew York, May 11, 2009 The writer is the director of the Arms and Security Initiative at the New America Foundation.  To the Editor: “The Trouble With Zero” calls attention to the growing momentum, led by President Obama, for pragmatic steps toward the achievement of a world without nuclear weapons. But it should have stressed that the nuclear weapon states’ lackluster progress in meeting their Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty commitments on disarmament has eroded the willingness of the other states to fulfill their obligations to help strengthen the treaty. One of the major benefits of serious United States action on disarmament — beginning with ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and deeper American-Russian nuclear cuts — will be to strengthen support among non-nuclear-weapon states for new measures to curb the spread of technologies that can be used to produce nuclear weapons and to clamp down on violators. Daryl G. KimballExec. Dir., Arms Control Assn. Washington, May 11, 2009  To the Editor: Governments, with pressure from civil society, have banned dum-dum bullets, chemical and biological weapons, and land mines, so why not imagine a world for future generations without nuclear weapons? Let’s call it the challenge of zero. Margaret MelkonianUniondale, N.Y., May 10, 2009 The writer is co-director of the Long Island Alliance for Peaceful Alternatives.  To the Editor: “The Trouble With Zero” states that the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty “has proved ineffectual in moving the world toward nuclear disarmament.” It does not, however, say that a major cause of this stalemate has been the continuing lack of compliance by the United States, and the other nuclear weapon states, with the obligation of Article VI of the treaty to negotiate in good faith toward complete nuclear disarmament. But in a message sent earlier this month to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty meeting at the United Nations, President Obama assured the delegates of his commitment to take concrete steps to “seek the peace and security of a world free of nuclear weapons.”  This is a significant change from the past.

It was the North Korean leader’s first public meeting with a foreign visitor since reports of his stroke in August.
==::==
2009-01-24T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL, South Korea —Kim Jong-il, the North Korean leader, met a senior Chinese Communist Party official on Friday, Chinese and North Korean media reported. The meeting, in Pyongyang,North Korea, was Mr. Kim’s first public meeting with a foreign visitor since August, when he is believed to have suffered a stroke. Analysts in Seoul saw the meeting as a North Korean attempt to demonstrate to the outside world that Mr. Kim was in control of his government, well enough to make important decisions about its nuclear weapons program and deal with the new American administration. Xinhua,China’s state-run news agency, first reported Mr. Kim’s meeting with the official, Wang Jiarui, who is chief of the Chinese Communist Party’s International Department. The account did not mention Mr. Kim’s health. Xinhua said Mr. Wang had arrived in the North Korean capital on Wednesday for talks on strengthening economic and trade links. North Korean news media later reported that Mr. Kim hosted a lunch for Mr. Wang’s delegation, adding that Mr. Wang gave Mr. Kim a personal letter from President Hu Jintao of China. North Korean media also released photos of the event. “North Korea must have timed the meeting in part to demonstrate once and for all that Kim remains in charge,” said Kim Yong-hyun, a North Korea expert at Dongguk University in Seoul. “As the new U.S. president Barack Obama is said to support dialogue with North Korea, Kim needed to signal to Washington that he is well enough to accept an envoy.” Analysts in Seoul had speculated that when Mr. Kim recovered sufficiently from what was believed to be a  stroke, he would invite a dignitary from China, North Korea’s closest ideological ally, to demonstrate that he was still in charge. Another sign that Mr. Kim’s health was improving came recently when North Korea announced that it would hold a long-delayed election of its rubber-stamp Parliament, the Supreme People’s Assembly, on March 8. An election had been expected last August. The legislature’s first task would be to re-elect Mr. Kim to another five-year term as chairman of the National Defense Commission, the North’s most powerful agency. With no clear successor for Mr. Kim, the news that intelligence officials in Seoul and Washington believed he had had a stroke set off fear of a potential leadership vacuum in the isolated country, which has been the focus of international efforts to halt its nuclear weapons program. Intelligence officials in Seoul have said that Mr. Kim, 66, underwent brain surgery after the stroke. North Korea has vehemently denied reports of Mr. Kim’s illness. In recent months, its state-run media have published a series of reports describing his visits to military units, factories and farms, releasing photographs but no video of his activities, fueling doubts about his health.

North Korea vowed to ignore Japan at talks due to begin on Monday among representatives from five regional powers aimed at reviving a nuclear disarmament deal.
==::==
2008-12-08T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL — Representatives from five regional powers converged in Beijing on Sunday to join the Bush administration’s last efforts to revive a nuclear disarmament deal withNorth Korea, while the Communist North vowed to ignoreJapanat the talks. The American assistant secretary of State,Christopher R. Hill,  will use the Beijing talks, scheduled to begin on Monday, to try to persuade North Korea to allow outside experts to take nuclear waste samples for testing, a key procedure in determining the reclusive country’s past nuclear activities. Mr. Hill held preliminary talks with his North Korean counterpart, Kim Kye-gwan, in Singapore last week and later said he expected the Beijing conference to be “difficult.” On Sunday, Kim Sook, the South Korean envoy to the six-nation talks, said: “I am not very optimistic.” In its final weeks in power, the Bush administration is struggling to complete the so-called “second phase” toward Washington’s ultimate goal of dismantlingNorth Korea’s nuclear weaponsprograms. That phase calls for North Korea to disable  —  but not destroy  — its main nuclear complex north of Pyongyang and agree to a method of verifying its past nuclear activities in return for one million tons of fuel aid and removal from Washington’s list of state sponsors of terrorism. Mr. Hill’s last-ditch efforts faced serious huddles in Pyongyang, where analysts say the regime is more interested in dealing with the new administration of President-elect Barack Obama, and also in Tokyo, where disgruntled policymakers refused to join Washington and others in shipping fuel aid to the North.In a rebuff to Washington’s approach, Japan has refused to donate its share of 200,000 tons of fuel unless North Korea first addresses the kidnappings of more than a dozen Japanese citizens in the 1970s and ‘80s. Washington and Seoul are now talking with countries like Australia and New Zealand to shoulder Japan’s share. Only half of the promised 1 million tons of fuel has been delivered. North Korea in turn is slowing down the disablement of its nuclear complex in Yongbyon, where it has produced plutonium for weapons.Barring a dramatic breakthrough in Beijing this week, officials in Seoul say that the task of completing the second phase will be handed over to the Obama administration. “We will neither treat Japan as a party to the talks nor deal with it even if it impudently appears in the conference room, lost to shame,” a spokesman of North Korea’s Foreign Ministry was quoted as saying on Saturday by the country’s official Korean Central News Agency. North Korea has issued similar threats before. Since he became Washington’s front man on North Korea in 2005, Mr. Hill has cobbled together key agreements with North Korea, including the September 2005 deal that laid out a road map toward the North’s nuclear disarmament. But he has stumbled over Pyongyang’s tactic of giving vague commitments to win American concessions and then retracting them, saying nothing was written down. The latest case in point involved the dispute over nuclear samples. In October, Washington announced that the North agreed to allow sampling, and removed the North from the terror list. But a month later, the North said it had never given such a promise and Washington had no written document to prove otherwise. Washington seeks a comprehensive method of verifying North Korea’s nuclear history. It wants, for example, to check whether North Korea has a uranium-enrichment program and has proliferated nuclear technology to countries such as Syria. But North Korea insists that separate, more detailed verification systems be renegotiated in line with progress in the disarmament talks. It intends to keep key parts of its nuclear programs in the dark so it can use them as leverage in future talks.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 17 — The Sept. 6 attack by Israeli warplanes insideSyriastruck what Israeli intelligence believes was a nuclear-related facility thatNorth Koreawas helping to equip, according to current and former American and Israeli officials. Details about the Israeli assessment emerged as   China abruptly canceled planned diplomatic talks in Beijing that were to set a schedule to disband nuclear facilities in North Korea. The Bush administration has declined to comment on the Israeli raid, but American officials were expected to confront the North Koreans about their suspected nuclear support for Syria during those talks. The American and Israeli officials said  the Israeli government notified the Bush administration about the planned attack just before the raid. It is not clear whether administration officials expressed support for the action or counseled against it. The raid has aroused  intense speculation in Washington and Jerusalem, but details remain extraordinarily murky. Officials said access to new intelligence about suspected North Korean support to Syria has been confined to a very small group of officials in Washington and Jerusalem. The details of the Israeli intelligence remain highly classified, and the accounts aboutIsrael’s thinking were provided by current and former officials who are generally sympathetic to Israel’s point of view. It is not clear whether American intelligence agencies agree with the Israeli assessment about the facility targeted in the raid, and some officials expressed doubt that Syria has either the money or the scientific talent to initiate a serious nuclear program. But current and former American and Israeli officials who have received briefings from Israeli sources said Monday that the raid was an attempt by Israel to destroy a site that Israel believed to be associated with a rudimentary Syrian nuclear program. The allegations come at a particularly delicate time, with the United States and several Asian countries testing whether North Korea is serious about dismantling its nuclear production facilities and providing a full accounting of all its nuclear facilities, fuel and weapons. Israel is also wary of complicating continuing peace talks involving other countries in the Middle East about the future of aPalestinianstate. In particular, the Bush administration has not decided yet whether Syria will be invited to a Middle East peace conference that is to be held in Washington in November. A tense Israel-Syria standoff would further complicate that decision, Israeli and American officials said. The Sept. 6 strike was carried out  several days after a ship with North Korean cargo tracked by Israeli intelligence docked in a Syrian port, according to the current and former officials. The cargo was transferred to the site that Israel later attacked, the officials said.   It is unclear exactly what the shipment contained. A former top American official said the Israelis had monitored the site for some time before the ship arrived.  The ship’s arrival in Syria before the raid was first reported Saturday by The Washington Post. It is also unclear why China decided at the 11th hour to postpone the planned talks, but Beijing’s decision seemed  to put off a possible confrontation between the United States and North Korea that  could have scuttled the diplomatic talks with North Korea. Christopher R. Hill, the top American negotiator for the talks, had already packed his bags and was preparing to depart for Beijing when he was notified of China’s decision to delay the negotiations, American officials said. North Korea has a long relationship with Syria, mostly involving the sale of weapons, particularly technology for relatively primitive missiles. But it has never been caught exporting nuclear-related material to either Syria or Iran, another of its customers for missile technology. On Sunday on Fox News, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates declined to confirm either whether Israel had attacked targets in Syria or whether North Korea was providing nuclear-related assistance to that Arab country. But he warned, “If such an activity were taking place, it would be a matter of great concern because the president has put down a very strong marker with the North Koreans about further proliferation efforts, and obviously any effort by the Syrians to pursue weapons of mass destruction would be a concern.” A senior North Korean diplomat dismissed the accusations, the South Korean news agency Yonhap said Sunday. “They often say things that are groundless,” Kim Myong-gil, North Korea’s deputy United Nations mission chief, told Yonhap. Whether North Korean actions could ultimately cause a breakdown in disarmament talks may well depend on what, if anything, the United States concludes about the nature of any illicit relationship between Syria and the North. The most benign of the theories is that the cargo had no use in a nuclear program. Another theory is that any equipment shipped from North Korea to Syria  was designed to help Syria mine uranium and transform it into enriched uranium. That could mean that Syria is involved in only the early stages of any nuclear activity, and it  could argue that the mining operation is for something other than weapons. But any shipment of nuclear fuel to Syria by North Korea would be much more significant, though that is considered less likely and very risky for North Korea at this time. “It would almost defy credibility that the North Koreans would be willing to risk so much to engage in a nuclear weapons-related proliferation,” said Evans Revere, the president of the Korea Society in New York and a former senior American diplomat in Seoul.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 14 — A State Department official said Friday that the United States had concerns aboutSyria’s involvement in illicit nuclear activities and suggested thatNorth Koreamight be aiding the Syrians in their efforts. Andrew Semmel, a top official on countering the spread of nuclear weapons, said that Syria may have a number of “secret suppliers” for a covert nuclear program, and that North Korean technicians were currently operating inside Syria. His comments, in an interview with The Associated Press in Rome, came in response to questions about an Israeli airstrike inside Syria last week. Neither Israel nor the United States has confirmed what targets the Israeli jets hit, and the government in Jerusalem has imposed a blanket restriction on the Israeli news media from reporting details about the raid. American officials have been similarly tight-lipped, and officials who ordinarily see intelligence reports on such issues say their access has been restricted. Mr. Semmel did not specify whether the technicians in Syria were specialists in nuclear technology; North Korea has long supplied Syria with missile technology. Some weapons experts said they were skeptical that Syria was in league with North Korea to build a secret program. Damascus is not thought to have made serious efforts in the past to develop nuclear weapons, and those experts said it was unlikely that the Syrians could afford such a program or  had the technical expertise to sustain it. The speculation about possible North Korean activities inside Syria is heightening the Bush administration’s concern about the future of its diplomatic efforts to dismantle North Korea’s nuclear program. The Bush administration’s top negotiator for North Korea, Christopher R. Hill, said that the United States still planned to go ahead with an agreement for food and fuel aid to North Korea in exchange for its decision to dismantle its nuclear program. “We’ve always been concerned about the issue of proliferation,” Mr. Hill told reporters during a news conference at the State Department. “To me, this simply is an important reminder of the need to accelerate the process which we’ve already engaged in, to achieve denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” He declined to say whether the United States had sought a specific explanation from North Korean officials, and added that the issue “does not change the goal of what we’re aiming for.” A Bush administration official said earlier this week that over the past several weeks, Israel had conducted several aerial surveillance flights over Syria to take pictures of what Israeli officials were said to believe could be possible nuclear development installations. North Korea’s government took the unusual step of publicly condemning the Israeli strike. The Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua cited a North Korean Foreign Ministry official on Tuesday as calling the Israeli strike “a very dangerous provocation, little short of wantonly violating the sovereignty of Syria and seriously harassing the regional peace and security.” Some who advocate a hard-line stance toward North Korea, including former top Bush administration officials, said that possible intelligence about North Korea’s efforts to aid Syria should halt diplomatic talks with Pyongyang. “It would be a big mistake for the State Department to push ahead with the six-party process without this being resolved,” said John R. Bolton, a former United States ambassador to the United Nations, referring to the diplomatic talks with North Korea. “They are rushing to finish this and declare victory, which could be a catastrophe for the president.”

Nuclear Showdown North Korea Takes on the World By Gordon C. Chang Illustrated. 327 pages. Random House. $25.95. If Dean Rusk were alive today, no doubt he would rethink that impulsive moment in August 1945 when, as an Army officer, he drew a line on a National Geographic map across the 38th parallel and created what became the border of the two Koreas. By the time Mr. Rusk became secretary of state in the Kennedy administration, that border was the DMZ, and a hotspot in the Cold War.

We hope that President Bush learns the most basic lesson of this week’s deal with Pyongyang: sometimes you really do have to talk to your enemies, even if you have to grit your teeth.

It is welcome news that North Korea has agreed to move toward dismantling its nuclear weapons program in exchange for fuel oil and international acceptance — including the hope of eventual recognition by the United States. When dealing with Pyongyang (and for that matter, the Bush administration), a lot can slip betwixt the cup and the lip. But if all goes as agreed, the world will be safer. The obvious question to ask is: What took so long? And even more important: Will President Bush learn from this belated success? Will he finally allow his diplomats to try negotiation and even compromise with other bad and undeniably dangerous governments? Mr. Bush could probably have gotten this deal years ago, except that he decided he didn’t have to talk to anyone he didn’t like. So long as the White House refused to talk, North Korea churned out plutonium. And once American negotiators were finally allowed to mix their sanctions with sanity and seriously negotiate, they struck a deal. We’ll overlook the irony of this administration, which considers the word multilateral an epithet, insisting yesterday that Mr. Bush had not compromised on anything because the Chinese, Japanese, South Koreans and Russians were also involved. There are still a lot of negotiations to come before North Korea disarms — and no guarantees. If the past is prelude, it will try to reopen the bidding or try to squirrel away a few nuclear weapons or their makings. Its closest neighbors, China and South Korea, which have been enabling Pyongyang for years, will try to excuse any backsliding. So the Bush administration will have to be the deal’s lead enforcer. For that, its behavior needs to be above reproach. Mr. Bush should start by ordering his aides (and his vice president) to embrace the triumph of diplomacy, no matter how much it pains them. As for the lessons to be learned, there are a lot of other bad actors out there with whom Mr. Bush is still refusing to speak. Iran is resisting the White House’s saber rattling and bullying. Mr. Bush could test Tehran by including it in a regional conference to discuss how to contain Iraq’s chaos. And it would certainly enliven the discussion on Iran’s nuclear program if the White House suggested that it would drop its plans for regime change once and for all and move toward diplomatic recognition if Tehran would control its nuclear appetites. And there are others, like Syria, which might — with the right incentives — be persuaded to rethink its ill-begotten friendships with Hezbollah and Tehran. Or Cuba, preferably before Castro goes and the Cuban people decide their only choices are violence or remaining frozen in Communist amber for another generation. We are not saying that all of these governments will respond, even to a cold calculation of their own interests. But this administration has not tried to find out. There will be a lot of talk in Washington about Mr. Bush salvaging a failing presidency. We don’t want to take away from the glow. But there are a lot of other dangers out there. And we hope that Mr. Bush learns the most basic lesson of this week’s deal: sometimes you really do have to talk to your enemies, even if you have to grit your teeth.

In the suburbs north of here, the thaw between the Koreas has led South Korea to dismantle highway barricades meant to slow down an invasion of North Korean tanks. Japan, meanwhile, has begun investing billions of dollars in erecting a high-tech shield against North Korean missiles. South Korea and Japan, America's two major allies in this region, have grown increasingly apart in their attitudes and policies toward North Korea, even though President Roh Moo-hyun said Monday that the North's announcement of a nuclear test had put him on the same page as Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe.

SEOUL,South Korea—North Koreasaid Monday that annual American-South Korean military exercises that began over the weekend could further delay progress on ending the North’s nuclear weapons programs. Although such criticism from the Communist country is routine, it dampened hopes for warmer ties between the United States and North Korea — hopes that had been raised after the New York Philharmonic’s concert last Tuesday in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang. News also emerged from Pyongyang over the weekend that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, who did not attend the Philharmonic’s concert, paid a rare visit to the Chinese Embassy in Pyongyang on Saturday for  “cordial talks” — a move that suggested that Mr. Kim was striking a delicate diplomatic balance between the big powers. The military exercise, which involves tens of thousands of United States and South Korean troops and the Nimitz, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, was “an exercise for invasion to trigger a nuclear war,” the North’s official Korean Central News Agency quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying. “This nuclear threat won’t work with us, but will only put the brakes on the denuclearization process on the Korean Peninsula.” The United States and South Korea have been staging annual joint war games for years, and each year North Korea criticizes them. The disarmament talks are bogged down over North Korea’s failure to meet the agreed-upon deadline of Dec. 31, 2007,  to make a complete declaration of its nuclear programs. Analysts say the main sticking point is North Korea’s reluctance to state whether it tried to enrich uranium or to transfer nuclear technology to Syria.

At the Kaesong Industrial Complex, 121 mostly South Korean companies to employ 44,000 North Koreans despite rising political tensions.

DORASAN, South Korea — Every day, hundreds of South Korean managers and engineers gather here at the steel and glass bus terminal to make an unusual commute, through the minefields and tank traps of the demilitarized zone and into an industrial park that sits just across the border inNorth Korea. And while tensions on the Korean Peninsula are at their highest point in years over the sinking of a South Korean warship, the North continues to allow the Southerners to enter the park, theKaesongIndustrial Complex, where 121 mostly South Korean companies employ 44,000 North Korean workers. At a time when the Koreas have traded threats of military confrontation and cut most economic and diplomatic ties, the Kaesong complex has remained a conspicuous exception. The complex, the largest economic link created during a relaxation of inter-Korean tensions almost a decade ago, has continued to operate even after the sinking in March of the warship, theCheonan, and the recent closing of other joint projects. So far, the two Koreas appear reluctant to meddle too much with the industrial park, even as they show no qualms about manhandling each other elsewhere. The South is asking the United Nations Security Council to reprimand the North for the sinking, which it attributes to a North Korean torpedo. The North vehemently denies the accusation and has vowed to retaliate if there are any new sanctions. Political experts say the park remains open for now because neither side believes that it can afford to close it, though for different reasons. For the isolated North, it is a source of desperately needed jobs and hard currency, pumping $50 million per month into the collapsed North Korean economy. North Korea watchers say it is also one of the few economic successes that the government has to show its people, at a time when the North’s ailing leader, Kim Jong-il, appears to be engineering the succession of his third son, Kim Jong-un. “The leadership knows that unless it can raise people’s livelihoods, the succession may fail,” said Lim Eul-chul, a professor of North Korean studies at Kyungnam University in Seoul. For the South’s vibrant economy, the park’s $250 million annual output is just a drop in the bucket. Kaesong has more emotional significance as a symbol that the two Koreas may one day peacefully reunify. Even the administration of President Lee Myung-bak, who has taken a harder line against the North, has been careful to keep the park operating to convey to the North that “the door remains open for improving ties,” as one senior official put it. Experts and business leaders with dealings in the North say China’s economic rise also makes the park important for the two Koreas. South Korean businesses hope North Korea can become a source of low-wage labor to help them compete with China’s export machine, while the North appears anxious about its excessive economic reliance on China, its closest political ally. “Neither Korea wants to be responsible for shutting down Kaesong because of its role in our history,” said Yoo Chang-geun, president ofSJ Tech, a South Korean electronics company that owns a factory in the park. None of this has prevented both Koreas from using the industrial park as a point of leverage in the showdown over the Cheonan. The South reduced the number of South Koreans who can live in the complex, to about 500 people now. The North has repeatedly threatened to close the park, most recently saying it would do so if the South resumed propaganda broadcasts by loudspeakers across the demilitarized zone. Resuming the cold-war-style broadcasts is one of the ways the South has vowed to retaliate for the sinking of the Cheonan. Despite the recent tensions, South Koreans who work at the complex say they have no difficulty coming or going: on Friday, 489 South Koreans entered the complex, according toSouth Korea’sMinistry of Unification, which manages inter-Korean relations, a figure that is typical. On a recent morning, South Korean managers and engineers waiting at the futuristic bus terminal here said the Cheonan’s sinking had made them nervous about their commutes into the North. The buses and trucks move in convoys along a newly constructed highway across the two-mile-wide, heavily fortified border and into the industrial zone, a sprawling collection of prefabricated factories separated by a tall fence and North Korean soldiers from the drably gray North Korean city of Kaesong. The managers said they did not know how their North Korean employees felt about the ship’s sinking because contact had always been limited, and usually took place through North Korean minders. However, they said North Korean messages over the loudspeakers in the complex had denounced the South’s version of the Cheonan’s sinking as fiction. Still, the managers’ biggest difficulty has been a decline in orders from South Korean buyers, who they said had stopped buying from Kaesong factories for fear the complex might suddenly be closed down for political reasons. They also said they were worried that the North would close the complex if the South resumed its political broadcasts. “We are being used as bargaining chips in a political game,” said Jimmy Bae, director of strategic planning at Cuckoo Electronics, a South Korean electronics company that has a $10 million factory in the complex. While discerning the North’s intentions is always a challenge, South Korean officials say North Korea has made it clear that it wants to keep the complex open. In late May, North Korean officials told South Korean Ministry of Unification officials that they still wanted to develop the complex, the ministry said. North Korea also announced new rules to restrict the ability of South Korean companies to remove equipment from factories in Kaesong — a move that the South Korean news media interpreted as an attempt to discourage companies from pulling out. Political experts say the North Korean government wants to show its people that Mr. Kim’s successor will be able to improve living standards. The government has been loosening central control over the economy since a disastrous currency reform last fall wiped out the meager personal savings of many North Koreans. “Kaesong is their best hope for luring foreign investment,” said Cho Bong-hyun, an author of books about the North Korean economy. China is also a key reason the North wants to keep the park open, say political experts and business leaders. They say the North wants South Korean investment to offset its current, almost total, economic dependence on China. South Korean companies say they were drawn to the park by the prospect of the North’s 24 million residents’ becoming a pool of low-cost, Korean-speaking labor to help them compete at a time when South Korean wages are approaching those in the leading industrialized nations. However, many companies that built factories in the park say they have yet to turn a profit, partly because North Korean workers are not as productive as their Chinese rivals. While some managers say they are considering pulling out, others show an almost evangelistic drive to put political considerations above economic. “We are in Kaesong for reasons of patriotism as well as business,” said Mr. Yoo of S J Tech, who said he had lost $4 million in the park since investing there in 2004. “I’m spreading the seeds of capitalism in North Korea.”

Asian history runs deep in the negotiations to disarm Kim Jong-il.

BEIJING FOR more than three years, the grinding, often exasperating negotiations overNorth Korea’s nuclear weapons program have been about taking the bomb away from Kim Jong-il. As if that were not complicated enough, the agenda is now becoming more ambitious. One new goal could be loosely described as cleaning up the 20th century. Starting tomorrow. That is when diplomats from the United States, North Korea, China,Japan,South KoreaandRussiawill reconvene in Beijing with a docket that is still dominated by nuclear disarmament but that also now includes unresolved disputes that have bedeviled northeast Asia for decades. The process might accomplish far more than denuclearization — a formal peace treaty ending the Korean War could be one dramatic possibility. Or it could just as easily collapse under the weight of so many moveable pieces and kill a nuclear deal, too. “This process, not unlike a video game, gets more and more difficult as you go into more and more levels,” Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs and chief American envoy, said earlier this month in New York. History can be omnipresent or repressed in northeast Asia, but nearly everyone agrees it is festering and unresolved. Historic resentments and nationalist anger are volatile and easily inflamed, as evidenced by the outrage that followed recent comments by Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, about Korean “comfort women” in World War II. Yet, most often, that anger is compartmentalized to protect the hum of commerce. China and Japan conduct record bilateral trade even as public attitudes in both countries can range anywhere from mutual distrust to open loathing. North Korea is a bit like the crazy uncle whose refusal to stay locked and quiet in the region’s attic has forced everyone to the same table,  with historic baggage and contemporary rivalries in tow. The North’s demands for economic and energy aid nearly derailed the last round of talks, and now negotiations are being separated into working groups to tackle decades-old issues like normalizing relations between North Korea and both Japan and the United States. Discussions over a peace treaty to end the Korean War will be held in a “separate forum” that has yet to be named. “These are the precise issues that North Korea really wants to address,” said Bates Gill, a China specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “They want a peace treaty. They want a normal relationship with the United States.” Already, animosities between Japan and North Korea that have nothing to do with nuclear weapons are roiling  the process. The working groups are the products of the deal struck last month in which North Korea agreed as an initial step toward denuclearization to close its main nuclear reactor by April. In return, the other nations agreed to make an initial shipment of 50,000 tons of fuel oil. Japan, though, refused to contribute to the aid package because of its claims of unresolved cases of Japanese abducted in the 1970s and 1980s by North Korean agents. Japan has insisted that the North address the issue before any progress can be made on normalizing relations. North Korea considers the matter resolved and a “nonissue.” Earlier this month, North Korea and Japan held their first working group on normalization and neither side budged. An afternoon session was unexpectedly canceled, reportedly because the North Koreans were incensed over the Japanese position on the abductees. The North, meanwhile, wants Japanese “atonement” as well as reparations for Japan’s colonial rule of the Korean peninsula during the first half of the 20th century. With no progress after two days of meetings, which were held in Hanoi, the best that Japan’s chief negotiator could say about the meetings was that both sides “reconfirmed our mutual positions.” No one expected a breakthrough, but the difficulties are worth noting, given the growing expectations for this diplomatic structure,  known as the six-party talks.  The Bush administration once regarded the talks with almost palpable distaste; now it seems to be embracing the idea that the talks could morph into the first permanent regional body dealing with security and other issues. Mr. Hill has often cast the disarmament talks as part of a larger, holistic effort to address the full range of conflicts in the region. “We are dealing not only with denuclearization, but we are dealing with some of the problems in the region, some of the problems in the region caused by the region’s difficult history,” Mr. Hill said at one news conference during last month’s negotiations in Beijing. “This type of ambitious undertaking hasn’t been tried before.” “Difficult history” is a gracious description. On some days, World War II seems ongoing. Japanese mines are still being unearthed in northeast China, and “patriotic education” in China has helped create a younger, more nationalistic generation that seems to relish confrontation with Japan. Diplomatic relations between the two countries were essentially paralyzed because of visits by the former Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, to a shrine for war dead and war criminals that China and South Korea consider a potent symbol of past Japanese militarism. Japan’s populace, meanwhile, is increasingly weary of the regional criticism and feel that rivals like China are using historical grievances to play contemporary politics and impede Japanese efforts to become a “normal” nation. South Korea’s relations with Japan are also seriously strained. And while trade has brought South Korea closer to China, those two countries also are arguing over an ancient historic dispute about China’s claims over a region considered the birthplace of the Korean people. This messy historical baggage only complicates the still unrealized task of disarming Mr. Kim.  Hawks in Washington warn that North Korea cannot be trusted and has no intention of relinquishing its nuclear arsenal. Others caution that it is unrealistic to expect the six-party talks to become a diplomatic cure-all for the region’s complicated security issues. Alan D. Romberg, a senior associate specializing in East Asia at the Henry L. Stimson Center in Washington, said the process was creating “habits of consultation” that could ease suspicions in the region. But he said he thought that the region’s security issues were far too complex to be resolved under a single diplomatic roof. He noted that Taiwan, which represents one of the region’s most contentious security issues, is not even part of the process. Japan and China, meanwhile, are locked in a testy dispute over territorial claims in the East China Sea as part of their rivalry over which country will eventually dominate the region. “I think there are a lot of over-expectations for what this will do,” Mr. Romberg said of the negotiations. “We could be bogged down pretty quickly. It depends on what everybody’s real goals are here.” Susan L. Shirk, a State Department official responsible for East Asia during the Clinton administration, said one advantage of expanding the agenda — and separating it into different negotiations — was that it sidelined polarizing issues like the Japanese abductees dispute away from the talks about nuclear disarmament. But she added that Japan’s insistence on focusing on the issue could serve to marginalize Japan  in the broader discussions, even as China, the host, stays above the fray. “You have China at the center of the action and Japan at the margins,” said Ms. Shirk, now director of the Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation at the University of California, San Diego. “In the rivalry between China and Japan — and I would say they are both rising powers,” she said, “in this arena, we see China playing it so they are coming out ahead.” The future, and how it will look in northeast Asia, is a matter of international concern. Japan, China and South Korea represent the world’s 2nd-, 4th- and 11th-largest economies. The region is considered a model of restraint and practicality compared with the Middle East, but analysts do not rule out the possibility of future conflict. For now, though, the past must be navigated.
