YEONPYEONG ISLAND, South Korea — Choi Cheol-yeong vividly recalls the shock and fear that he felt duringNorth Korea’s lethal bombardment of this small island, and says his nerves remain on edge because he thinks another attack will come, possibly duringSouth Korean artillery drillsthis week. “I have a bad feeling that something might happen, but we’re ready if it does,” said Mr. Choi, a town official here, pointing to a filing cabinet near his desk, where he keeps a gas mask. Two weeks after aNorth Korean artillery barrageshattered the tiny fishing community on Yeonpyeong Island, and raised fears acrossSouth Koreaabout its heavily armed neighbor, many South Koreans are convinced that the North will strike again, and a parlor game of sorts has developed around the question of where. South Korean and foreign political analysts say the North is growing more desperate, facing food shortages in the winter and at the same time trying to secure the succession of the youngest son of North Korea’s ailing dictator,Kim Jong-il. In that situation, experts say, the government typically resorts to hostile and provocative military actions as the preferred way to pressure the economically wealthier and thus more vulnerable South into giving the aid and investment that North Korea needs to survive. “The past pattern shows that North Korea will strike in some unimaginable way,” said Kim Jong-ha, a professor of defense and security studies at Hannam University in Daejeon, South Korea. “It may not come for a few months, but we must be ready or the shock and awe will be so great.” The question of another attack has taken on added significance after the bombardment here and the sinking in March of the South Korean warshipCheonan, apparently by a North Korean torpedo, exposed unexpected weaknesses in South Korea’s technologically superior military. Stung by criticism of the military’s anemic response, South Korea’s president,Lee Myung-bak, replaced his defense minister with a retired chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Kim Kwan-jin, who immediately vowed to strengthen South Korea’s forces and respond more robustly to future attacks by the North. “There is a possibility that they will attack again in an unexpected way,”Mr. Kim saidDec. 3  at a nomination hearing at the National Assembly, South Korea’s Parliament. “I believe our entire country is a possible target for provocations.” Military analysts are divided on what to expect next. But they agree that North Korea is adept at searching out and exploiting weak points in South Korea’s better financed and provisioned forces. In the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island, for example, defenses designed to repel a seaborne invasion were virtually useless in responding to a limited artillery attack, analysts said. “South Korea got sucker-punched on Yeonpyeong,” said Daniel Pinkston, an analyst on North Korea for the International Crisis Group. “North Korea is always looking for weakness, and doesn’t attack force on force.” It is impossible to predict where North Korea will attack next, if it does at all. But analysts pointed to several possibilities: ¶The Yellow Sea. Yeonpyeong is one of five islands surrounded by waters that are claimed by both Koreas and have been the most common points of contention in recent years. North Korea’s options here range from another artillery or rocket barrage to a limited ground strike by commandos. The North might also choose another naval target, like one of the warships or floating bases that the South maintains in these waters. Analysts point to theCheonanas a classic case of North Korea’s probing for weak points: while the South has been building stronger and faster warships than the North, it apparently neglected to consider the possibility of a submarine attack. Some analysts say the North does have legitimate grievances in itsmaritime border disputewith the South in the Yellow Sea. Others say it is using that dispute to give its provocations a fig leaf of legitimacy to avoid angering China, its only ally. They say China might view any additional attack as an affront to its current diplomatic initiatives to convene emergency talks between the North and other nations. ¶The DMZ. There has been fearful speculation in the South Korean news media that North Korea may strike somewhere along the demilitarized zone, or DMZ, the heavily fortified border that has divided the peninsula since the 1950-53 Korean War. One theory is that the North may mount a limited artillery attack across the border in Gyeonggi Province, which surrounds Seoul, South Korea’s political and financial heart. The attack would be aimed at rattling the South’s nerves and sapping its will to fight, analysts say, rather than trying to inflict maximum damage on civilians. Even a small attack might be enough to cause a financial panic, they say, battering South Korea’s stock market and scaring away foreign investors. ¶A terrorist strike. The next blow may come in the form of so-called asymmetrical attacks, which would sidestep the South’s military advantages with strikes by the North’s 180,000 or so special forces troops on soft targets in civilian areas. This could be a bomb on a subway or train, or a cyberattack on a South Korean bank or computer network. Analysts say there are signs that the North may be developing capability in information technology, at a time when South Korean security agencies have increasingly accused North Korean agents of using the Internet to spread propaganda in the South, one of the world’s most wired societies. ¶A nuclear or missile test. At least one security expert, Baek Seung-joo, of the government-run Korea Institute for Defense Analyses, said he expected North Korea’s next provocation to be less deadly, perhaps another nuclear or long-range-missile test. He said such strategic brinkmanship would be aimed at pressing not only the South into new talks on dismantling the North’s weapons programs in exchange forfood aid, but also the United States into talks on security guarantees for the Kim family government. For now, the South Korean military is focusing most of its attention on fortifying Yeonpyeong and the other four Yellow Sea islands, having been stung by public criticism of its apparently poor showing two weeks ago. The island’s defenders fired back less than half the 170 rounds or more fired by North Korea, and satellite photographs appeared to show that many of their shots seemed to be off target, falling harmlessly in farmers’ fields. “The North Korean military has been regarded as a paper tiger because of fuel and supply shortages,” said Kazuhisa Ogawa, a Tokyo-based military analyst, “but South Korea’s military also revealed that it was not ready.” On Yeonpyeong Island, Mr. Choi, the town official, said the town hall was now staffed 24 hours, ready to hurry the small number of remaining residents into shelters should another attack occur. “We don’t get much sleep,” he said, “but they won’t catch us off guard again.”

Less than two weeks after the North shelled the island of Yeonpyeong, South Korea began live-fire artillery drills.

SEOUL, South Korea — Brushing aside North Korean warnings of war,South Koreabegan live-fire artillery drills on Monday, less than two weeks after the North’s shelling of a South Korean island sharply escalated tensions between them. A senior government official confirmed that the drills had begun at a number of locations along the Korean coastline, but he said no exercises would be staged near the island that was shelled, Yeonpyeong. The North’sbarrage of the islandon Nov. 23 killed two marines and two civilians in one of the most serious episodes since the 1953 armistice that halted the Korean War. South Korean forces fired back but the response was considered so feeble that it led to a shakeup in the Defense Ministry and tougher rules of military engagement with the North. The South Korean military said last week that it would soon be holding artillery drills but did  not indicate when. The drills are expected to last about a week. North Korea, through its official news agency, decried the new exercises, saying Seoul was “set to orchestrate the second Yeonpyeong Island incident at any cost and ignite a war.” On Monday, the International Criminal Court in The Hague opened a preliminary investigation into accusations that the North committed war crimes in the Nov. 23 attack and in a March torpedo strike on a South Korean ship, theCheonan, which killed 46 sailors, the court’s prosecutor said ina statement. North Korea has denied sinking the Cheonan. The country is not a signatory to the treaty that established the court and does not recognize its authority. The North said a previous live-fire drill by the South had sent shells into its territorial waters and thus provoked the artillery response against Yeonpyeong. South Korea said that it had directed its fire away from the North and that the attack was unprovoked. The North fired 170 rounds and the South responded with 80, defense analysts said. A security commission has recommended to President Lee Myung-bak that marine forces be increased to 12,000 from 5,000 on South Korea’s outlying islands, which lie just off the North Korean coast, according to a report Monday from the Yonhap news agency in Seoul. Artillery positions on the islands were already being bolstered and upgraded, defense officials said. Later Monday, senior diplomats from South Korea and Japan were due to meet in Washington to discuss the recent inter-Korean tensions, the artillery exchange and North Korea’s recently disclosed uranium enrichment program. Also Monday, President Obama spoke to Chinese President Hu Jintao about the tensions on the Korean Peninsula. In a phone conversation, Mr. Hu called for restraint from all sides, according to China’s state-run news agency, Xinhua.

North Korea’s chronic food shortages may have encouraged Pyongyang’s military action against South Korea on Tuesday.

PARIS — As outsiders from Beijing to Washington struggle to see a pattern in the secretive dynamics of the North Korean leadership, one part of the tangled  puzzle seems beyond dispute: the country’s 25 million people cannot feed themselves and face acute food shortages as they have done for many years. But that has not prevented — and indeed may have encouraged — the regime in Pyongyang in actions such as Tuesday’s shelling of a populated South Korean island or a weekend disclosure concerning what seems a new and ambitious effort to reactivateNorth Korea’s nuclear enrichment program. Just last month,South Korearesumed aid shipments of rice and instant noodles for the first time since early 2008 as part of an $8.5 million package that, though largely symbolic in relation to the crushing food shortages, was seen as the result of diplomatic overtures by the North in response to its economic plight. “It could be the starting point of a new chapter in inter-Korean relations,” Choi Jin-wook, a North Korea expert at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, said at the time. Such hopes seem to be drowned out Tuesday by the thunder of artillery barrages. “They’re in a desperate situation, and they want food immediately, not next year,” Mr. Choi said on Wednesday. “Food is the No. 1 issue.” Others used harsher terms. “This incident seems to fit the pattern of a Mafia shakedown,” said Tim Peters, a longtime resident in Seoul and head of Helping Hands Korea, an nongovernmental organization that works with North Korean defectors. “It’s a Mafia extortion by the Kim regime. And it has worked for them before: It’s the feed-us-or-we’ll-shoot-you approach. And now with winter coming on, they’re trying to get morefood aid.” “The regime wants just enough food to keep the population from turning.” Just days before the shelling, a joint report by two United Nations agencies — the World Food Program and the Food and Agriculture Organization — said that, despite a relatively good autumn harvest, North Korea remained in acute need of food, especially for its youngest children, pregnant women and the elderly. Around one-fifth of the 25 million population would continue to face food shortages, the report said. So critical was the situation that North Korea was short of around half a million tons of food and government hand-outs were inadequate. Rations provided by the government through its Public Distribution System “would likely contribute about half the daily energy requirements,” the report said, leaving many citizens to eke a living from black market food supplies or modest plots and gardens. “A small shock in the future could trigger a severe negative impact and will be difficult to contain if these chronic deficits are not effectively managed,” said Joyce Luma, the head of the World Food Program’s Food Security Analysis Unit who was a co-leader of a mission to North Korea in September. The report said that between now and next October, North Korea would need to import an estimated 867,000 tons of food. The government plans to buy around 325,000 tons, leaving 542,000 tons as a shortfall. The two United Nations agencies recommended providing 305,000 tons in international food assistance to the most vulnerable population. Battered by severe floods, North Korea’s own agricultural sector — which the report called “the main contributor to the national income” — showed an increase in staple food production of only three percent in the current year compared to the previous year. The country’s main crops are unmilled rice followed by corn, potatoes, wheat and barley and soybeans.

A day after the exchange of fire between the two Koreas, focus turned to speculation about the intentions of the eccentric North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il.

SEOUL, South Korea — As nerves began to calm the day after  a prolonged and deadly artillery exchange between North andSouth Korea, focus turned on Wednesday to the possible motivations for the assault and whether the South might have provoked it. The Koreas blame each other for instigating the artillery barrages on Tuesday afternoon. The exchange, which lasted about an hour, centered on the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong, which lies in the western sea, eight miles off the North Korean coast. The incidentkilled two South Korean soldiersand President Lee Myung-bak expressed regret Wednesday afternoon over “the passing of the two marines who met a glorious death in defense of the homeland.” The charred bodies of two civilians also were discovered  as military teams canvassed the wreckage of the island. Yeonpyeong, essentially a fishing village, is about twice the size of New York’s Central Park. About 1,600 civilians live there, along with a marine garrison of about 1,000. The South Korean Defense Ministry said the attack on the island was unprovoked. In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. Lee called the attack “unprecedented.” “It was a premeditated provocation and an indiscriminate attack against civilians,” he said. ButNorth Korea, through its official news agency, said the South had fired first, sending live rounds from a battery on another island onto its side of the maritime border. “What has been missing in all the analysis is that we’re not listening to what North Korea says,” said Michael Breen, the author of a book about the two Koreas and a biography ofKim Jong-il, the North Korean leader. “Because of the blustering language the North Koreans always use, you tend to dismiss it. “But if the North was holding live-fire exercises five miles offshore from South Korea, it wouldn’t just be business as usual. These waters, they consider theirs. What’s the point, anyway, of doing these live-fire drills so close to North Korea?” The South Korean deputy defense minister acknowledged Tuesday night that the South had fired artillery close to North Korea, but he insisted the shots were aimed away from the North. Defense officials also said the North had known about the exercises. “But a military exercise is classically a cover for the real thing,” said Mr. Breen. “The North Koreans may have reasoned, in their paranoia, that an invasion was happening.” Another analyst said military exercises close to the North Korean coast have always angered Pyongyang. “It’s part of their threat perception,” said John Delury, a professor at the Graduate School of International Studies at Yonsei University in Seoul. “It contributes to the atmosphere of tension and conflict, and it makes it easier for North Korean hardliners to make something happen.” Mr. Delury and other analysts said the North knew it was raising the stakes in firing on an island with a civilian population, twice, in broad daylight, in the middle of the afternoon. There was no fog-of-war explanation for it, he said. “I find it hard to believe they felt they had no choice but to attack,” Mr. Delury said. “They knew they were ratcheting things up.” As diplomatic responses to the incident were being drafted in Washington, Seoul, Beijing and other capitals, the American  and South Korean militaries announced Wednesday that an aircraft carrier strike group would leada four-day exercise in the western seabeginning on Sunday. The strike group is led by the United States carrier George Washington. Mr. Breen called it “foolishness.” “The whole idea is just to give them the bird,” he said. “China is not going to react well to this,” added Mr. Delury. “They may wait a day or two, but they’re going to be upset.” North Korea scholars in Seoul said the arrival of the aircraft carrier, as a potent symbol of gunboat diplomacy, would likely bolster the hardliners inside the North Korean regime. “These guyswantaircraft carriers,” Mr. Delury said. “This is exactly the response they want.” The American   military, which called the upcoming drill “defensive in nature,” said it had been planned before the artillery exchange occurred. The previous exercises were postponed due to bad weather. The American general who heads the United Nations Command in South Korea, Gen. Walter L. Sharp, also called Wednesday for military talks with senior officers of the North Korean People’s Army “in order to initiate an exchange of information and deescalate the situation.”    The North, through its official news agency, rejected General Sharp's suggestion on Thursday morning. Many political analysts in Seoul agreed that the barrage by the North was probably approved by Kim Jong-il, reputed to be an all-knowing micro-manager who famously dispenses “on-the-spot guidance” to farmers, factory managers, generals, physicists, pilots, textile workers  or anyone else he visits. “Something like this has to be cleared at the highest level, no matter what,” said Lee Sung-yoon, a professor of international politics at the Fletcher School at Tufts University in Massachusetts. Mr. Lee rejected the idea that a maverick military commander seeking to curry favor or score political points with Mr. Kim might have authorized  the attack on his own. “There is no ‘rogue elements’ theory applicable here,” Mr. Lee said. “This is how North Korea approaches negotiations — not through the conventions of diplomatic courtesy but through raising the stakes through provocations. It’s been a potent formula, this provocation-negotiation-concession schema.” Mr. Breen, the Kim Jong-il biographer, said the widely held notion of Mr. Kim as unbalanced was inaccurate. Eccentric, perhaps. A dictator, certainly. But politically inept, no. “He’s not a foolish man at all,” Mr. Breen said. “He’s not crazy, not at all. He’s not nuts. That’s a very shallow analysis. “If he was here on a conference call with us, he’d say, “Look, if there’s a war, my country will be finished within a week. I know that. I’m not trying to start a war, I just don’t like enemy states holding live-fire exercises within stone-throwing distance of my coast.” As his artillery was pounding Yeonpyeong on Tuesday, Mr. Kim and his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, apparently toured a soy sauce factory and a medical school, according to an item from the North’s official news agency that was cited by the Yonhap news agency in Seoul. The item appeared Tuesday, although it was not clear that the father-son outing had taken place the same day. Kim Jong-un, who is believed to be 27 or 28,recently emerged as the apparent heirto his father. (The elder Kim had taken over from his father, the founding president of North Korea, Kim Il-sung.) Kim Jong-un recently was given significant political posts in the ruling Korean Workers’ Party and was awarded the rank of four star general despite no known record of having served in the military. Mr. Lee and other North Korea analysts said the clash on Tuesday was likely intended to bolster the political standing and military credentials of the son. The North would likely claim, he said, that “this is how the young general showed his mettle.” Mr. Lee said he expects further incidents by the North — including perhaps another nuclear test — in the coming weeks, perhaps to coincide with Kim Jong-un’s birthday on Jan. 8. The North has previously tested two nuclear devices. “North Korea will have a strong incentive to celebrate the heir apparent’s strategic genius on Jan. 8,” said Mr. Lee. “Whether the Boy Who Would Be King can sustain his impoverished kingdom over the long run is an entirely different question.” Meanwhile, the KOSPI stock index in Seoul opened nervously on Wednesday, but closed down just 0.2 percent. The index, one of the best-performing markets in the Asia-Pacific region, is up more than 20 percent from a year ago. The Nikkei index in Japan in lost 0.8 percent, although other markets in the region shook off worries about an escalation of the artillery incident and managed small gains. The Unification Ministry, the South Korean department that deals with most of the nonmilitary inter-Korean issues, said on Wednesday that further aid shipments to North Korea had been suspended. Under a previous agreement between the two Koreas, the South had already shipped 5,000 tons of rice, 3,000 tons of cement and 3 million cups of instant noodles to the North. In addition to Yeonpyeong, South Korea has other islands in the western sea that lie just off the North Korean coast. They fall under the Inchon metropolitan government, which ordered the residents of Baeknyeong, Daecheong and Socheong islands to evacuate, according to the South Korean daily Chosun Ilbo. The islands have air raid bunkers and bomb shelters, and local government officials said about 6,000 islanders took cover in 98 shelters.

South Korea said that it had reinstalled 11 sets of loudspeakers along the border in case it was provoked by the North.

SEOUL, South Korea — Less than a week after the appointment of a new leadership hierarchy inNorth Korea, the South Korean defense minister said that his country’s military would initiate a new and expanded propaganda war if provoked by the North. After six years of quiet along the border,South Koreahas reinstalled 11 sets of psychological warfare loudspeakers, Defense Minister Kim Tae-young said Tuesday in Seoul. He said his ministry had switched its transmitters to the easier-to-receive AM band and was ready to send thousands of AM radios and propaganda leaflets across the border using helium balloons. A continuing balloon and leaflet campaign by South Korean civilians has angered the North Korean government, which suggests that it has been effective. The leaflets ridicule the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, and call for people in the North to rise up. North Korea insisted that the leaflet issue be put on the agenda of recent bilateral military talks. If the South undertakes a new propaganda war, the North has warned that its artillery will fire across the border to destroy the loudspeakers. It also said it would shut down a jointly operated industrial complex in the North Korean town of Kaesong. North and South Korea agreed in 2000 to dismantle the loudspeaker systems along the border and to stop radio transmissions. There have been no loudspeaker blasts since 2004, although South Korea made a show of putting some speakers in place in May, after the sinking of a South Korean naval vessel, the Cheonan, in March. Forty-six sailors were killed. The North has denied any involvement. Meanwhile, an aide to  South Korea’s president, Lee Myung-bak, said Wednesday that the North’s nuclear program was moving  “at a very fast pace.” Mr. Lee’s secretary, Kim Tae-hyo, said, “We have judged that North Korea is currently operating all its nuclear programs, including highly enriched uranium processing and the nuclear facility in Yongbyon.” He was quoted Wednesday in the newspaper JoongAng Daily, The International Herald Tribune’s publishing partner in South Korea. A newly released satellite photo of the Yongbyon reactor complex in North Korea shows construction activity and two new buildings next to a cooling tower that was demolished by North Korea in 2008 as part of a denuclearization accord. Areportfrom the Institute for Science and International Security, a private group in Washington that tracks nuclear proliferation, said there was no indication that the North was rebuilding the tower. The group obtained the photo, which was taken Sept. 29. “In addition, the new excavation activity appears to be more extensive than would be expected for rebuilding the cooling tower,” the report said. “But the actual purpose of this excavation activity cannot be determined from the image and bears watching.” North Korea experts in Seoul found the timing of the statements on a possible propaganda war by the South Korean officials to be provocative and puzzling. “It’s not the right time for this,” said Paik Hak-soon, a North Korea scholar at the Sejong Institute, near Seoul. “It’s an offensive by the more conservative elements in the government.”

The large-scale naval exercises took place in waters near a disputed western sea border with N. Korea.

SEOUL, South Korea —South Koreakicked off one of its largest-ever naval exercises on Thursday in waters near a disputed western sea border withNorth Korea, despite the North’s threat to retaliate by attacking the South’s  warships participating in the drill. The exercises took place where a South Korean navy ship, theCheonan, was blown in two in March, killing 46 sailors. South Korean investigators say that the Cheonan was struck by a North Korean torpedo and have demanded an apology. The North has denied involvement. Officials from the Office of Joint Chiefs of Staff in Seoul said that South Korean marines spent the first day of training on an island near the site of the Cheonan’s sinking, running artillery drills aimed at searching and destroying enemy submarines. The operations invovled 29 ships, such as submarines and destroyers, and 50 fighters, anti-submarine helicopters and other aircraft. A total of 4,500 South Korean troops will participate in the five-day maneuvers, the military said in a statement. It is unusual for the South Korean military to launch a naval exercise of this size on its own, though it often conducts larger joint war games with the United States. Washington is putting together a new set of sanctions aimed at punishing the North over the Cheonan sinking and pressing it to give up itsnuclear weaponsprogram. Calling the latest exercise taking place in disputed border waters an “invasion,” North Korea threatened “strong physical retaliation” and warned South Korean fishermen to stay clear from the exercise zones. The South said it would not tolerate further provocations. “Raising issue with the legitimate, defensive exercise is a provocation in itself,” said Rear Adm. Kim Kyung-sik of South Korea said Wednesday, adding that live-fire battery exercises and torpedo and depth charge firing will all take place south of the so-called Northern Limit Line. South Korean officials said they detected no unusual North Korean military activity on Thursday. South Korea and the United States defend the line, which was drawn unilaterally by the American-led United Nations forces at the end of the 1950-3 Korean War, as a legitimate border. But the North does not accept it. The sinking of the Cheonan and the ensuing tensions appeared to revive a cold-war-like maneuvering around the Korean Peninsula, with the United States standing by the South while China joined the North in denouncing  United States  and South Korean military exercises in the region and staged its own naval and air defense exercises in recent days. South Korea and the United States conducted a joint military drill off the east coast of South Korea last month, out of deference to Chinese protests. But South Korea made a point of showing its force at the Yellow Sea site of the sinking with its own exercise.

Many South Koreans believe their government must continue to engage the North Koreans, whom they still view as impoverished if sometimes dangerous relatives.

MUNSAN, South Korea — Like many South Koreans, Choi Byung-wook said he felt outrage over the North Korean attack that sank the warshipCheonanand killed 46 sailors. But he also said that he did not expect the hostilities to get any worse and that his nation must continue to engage the North. “Inside, we are furious,” said Mr. Choi, 46, a government employee who shopped on a recent afternoon at a mall in this city just a few miles from the South’s heavily fortified border withNorth Korea. “But even with 46 dead, cutting off North Korea is not an option for us.” Mr. Choi’s views are typical in this affluent nation. Since the government released evidence implicating North Korea in the attack, reactions inSouth Koreahave ranged from anger to betrayal and even disbelief that North Korea would launch a strike against a neighbor that had showered it with fertilizer, investments andfood aid. But as the ship’s sinking has blown into an international crisis, South Koreans also seem divided over how to respond. Many appear reluctant to press the government to take action for fear of provoking the North even further. There is also strong sentiment here that regardless of the attack, South Koreans must continue to engage the North Koreans, whom they still view as impoverished if sometimes dangerous relatives. “South Korea has a dual perception of North Korea as both brother and enemy,” said Lee Nae-young, a political scientist at Korea University. “After the Cheonan, the majority sees the North as enemy, but the brother view also remains.” For now, public opinion seems to have swung behind President Lee Myung-bak, a conservative who has taken a tougher line toward the North than his most recent predecessors did and responded to the sinking by cutting most economic links with North Korea. A poll by Gallup Korea, released Thursday by The Chosun Ilbo, a newspaper, showed that 60 percent of respondents supported the government’s sanctions against the North. Political analysts say Mr. Lee has seized on the Cheonan attack as an opportunity to lift his approval ratings, which were hovering below 50 percent before the crisis but have risen sharply. Analysts say the sinking of the Cheonan  may also prove to be the final nail in the coffin of the so-called sunshine policy of his liberal predecessors, who in 2000 started giving the North aid with no strings attached in the hopes that it would open up.  Public support for that policy began to falter after North Korea’s first nuclear test in 2006. “We can’t just keep throwing money at North Korea if they do this,” said Lee Eun-chan, 72, a retired construction worker who recently ate dinner at a restaurant in Munsan. But while passions are running high, they are tempered by a deep-seated resistance here against returning to an era of cold-war politics and hostility toward the North,  political analysts say. A strong core of support for maintaining ties with the North cuts across South Korea’s otherwise divided landscape. Even President Lee has not called for permanently ending ties, but rather for resuming aid, trade and investment only when the North reciprocates by curtailing its nuclear programs. There is a strong sense of shared ethnic identity with Northerners, which runs deep enough that South Korean newspapers gave glowing coverage of the North Korean soccer team, which won its first World Cup berth in 44 years, even as they railed against the attack. Also, some here fear that the North’s isolated leadership might try to threaten the South’s prosperity if it is not appeased. While most of the business community has stood by the conservatives, Mr. Lee has alienated one group: the approximately 700 South Korean companies that do business with North Korea or invest there. Many complain that they will suffer huge losses if economic ties are severed. Particularly concerned are the 121  companies that have invested in the industrial park at Kaesong, which the North has recently threatened to close. “They thought their business was supposed to free from politics,” said Kim Kyung-woong, chairman of the Council for Inter-Korean Civil Economic Exchange, a lobbying group. The conflicting emotions stirred by the Cheonan’s sinking are also apparent in Munsan, a suburb of Seoul with rows of white high-rise apartments filled with middle-class Koreans. “It may be stupid of us not to just sever ties, but it is not that easy with North Korea,” said Park Eun-joo, 48, who sells shoes at a local shopping mall. “We are living better than they are, so we have to forgive them.”

President Lee Myung-bak convened a meeting of top military commanders on Tuesday, calling for a review of his country’s defense against North Korea.

SEOUL, South Korea — PresidentLee Myung-bakofSouth Korea, trying to figure out how to respond tothe sinkingof a South Korean warship in March, convened an unusual meeting of top military commanders on Tuesday in which he said the episode was “no accident” and vowed “clear and resolute measures” against those responsible. It was the first time a South Korean president had presided over a meeting of the country’s 150 most senior military officials, and a measure of the political burden the sinking of the ship, the 1,200-ton Cheonan, had  placed on Mr. Lee. Mr. Lee, in his third year in office and facing crucial mayoral and gubernatorial elections in June, must address his conservative base over what most South Koreans believe — or have been led to believe by government statements, like the ones on Tuesday — was a North Korean attack. But too much saber-rattling with the North could disrupt the financial markets. “He has to walk a fine line,” said Daniel Pinkston, a Seoul-based researcher for the International Crisis Group. “It’s not an easy thing to do.” As the South appeared to inch closer to formally blamingNorth Koreafor the sinking, both officials and analysts wondered whether it could produce evidence of North Korean involvement that, in Mr. Lee’s words, “those guilty cannot dispute.” Those questions loomed large this week, as Kim Jong-il, the reclusive North Korean leader, embarked on a secretive trip to China, his last remaining major ally. The trip is widely viewed as an attempt to win badly needed economic aid for the North and to counter any effort South Korea might make to punish it for the sinking of the ship, which left46 South Korean sailors dead or missing. “What has become clear so far is that the Cheonan sinking was no accident,” Mr. Lee told the  generals in a nationally televised speech. Experts are still investigating the explosion that sank the ship near a disputed sea border with the North. But the government has already said that the blast came from outside the vessel, and that a torpedo attack was the likeliest cause. To South Koreans, that leaves little other explanation than a North Korean attack. But they remain skeptical over what options their government might have in punishing the North, which has a history of launching military and terrorist provocations with impunity. Mr. Lee’s diplomatic leverage is also in question. Since taking office in 2008, he has rolled back his predecessors’ so-called sunshine policy of aid and engagement with the North, driving the North into China’s economic embrace. Those frustrations were heightened for South Koreans this week as they watched television footage of Mr. Kim during his visit to Dalian, an industrial port city in northeast China. Mr. Kim is believed to have met Vice Premier Li Keqiang at a banquet Monday night and toured Dalian’s port facilities on Tuesday, according to the news agency Yonhap and other South Korean news media. Mr. Kim’s entourage, which includes top North Korean party and military officials, was expected to travel to Beijing as early as Tuesday evening for meetings with Chinese leaders, including President Hu Jintao, according to South Korean news reports. Without Chinese support, any South Korean attempt to punish North Korea economically would have a limited impact. China is the source of 75 percent of all North Korean trade.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Korea, denouncingSouth Koreafor drawing up a contingency plan to deal with the potential collapse of the North’s government, warned Friday that it would cut off all dialogue with the South and exclude it from all negotiations concerning the security of the Korean Peninsula. North Korea will also wage a “pan-national holy war of retaliation to blow away” the South Korean government, said a statement from the North’s   highest ruling agency, the National Defense Commission, which is headed by the national leader, Kim Jong-il. “It is deeply regrettable that the North makes such a threatening statement against us based on unconfirmed reports,” Chun Hae-sung, a spokesman of the South Korean government’s Unification Ministry, said in a statement. The threat was surprising less for  its stridency, which is not unusual in  diatribes against the South and  the United States, than for  its timing. On Thursday, North Korea had proposed holding talks with the South on reviving  joint tour programs, which have been stalled for more than a year over the shooting death of a southern tourist and the North’s anger over Seoul’s policies. And only minutes before North Korea’s official news agency broadcast the statement, South Korea had announced that the North Korean Red Cross had accepted 10,000 tons offood aidoffered by its South Korean counterpart. The two gestures from the North fit within a recent series of conciliatory signs from the North — until Mr. Kim’s National Defense Commission waded in with its denunciation. The commission apparently was angered by news reports this week of a  South Korean contingency plan for North Korea. According to the newspapers Munhwa and Chosun, South Korea  recently dusted off and revised the  plan, apparently in the belief  that Mr. Kim’s uncertain health  and the North’s deepening economic woes under international sanctions have made the country more unstable . The news reports, which quoted unidentified officials in Seoul,  said that the plan addresses five possibilities: the death of Mr. Kim; a coup; a popular uprising; a huge outflow of refugees; and more sanctions or military attacks from the outside. It also envisions South Korea establishing on territory in the North  an “administrative headquarters to liberate the North.” South Korea said that it and the United States had a contingency plan for unrest in North Korea but refused to reveal its details. “This is a plan to topple our republic,” the North Korean statement said on Friday. “We will start a pan-national holy war of retaliation to blow away the den of South Korean authorities, including the presidential Blue House, who have led and supported the drawling up of this plan,” it said. North Korea did not elaborate on what a “holy war” might entail, but said it would  involve “all our revolutionary military power and all Korean compatriots both in the North and the South and abroad.” The North also demanded that South Korea apologize. Otherwise, it said,  it would exclude the South from “all talks on improving ties between the North and the South and negotiations on securing peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.” North Korea had previously threatened a “holy war” against its external enemies, especially the United States. On Monday, North Korea proposed new talks to negotiate a peace treaty with the United States that would formally conclude  the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended  in a truce and left the peninsula technically in  a state of war. Seoul and Washington rejected the proposal, insisting that they can start such talks only after the North returns to six-nation nuclear disarmament negotiations  and begins dismantling itsnuclear weaponsprograms.

SEOUL, South Korea —South Koreaand the United States said Tuesday that they would discuss a peace treaty withNorth Koreaonly after the North returned to six-nation disarmament talks and began dismantling itsnuclear weaponsprogram. The two countries also rejected the North’s demand that United Nations sanctions be lifted before it returns to the talks. “We’ re not going to pay North Korea for coming back to the six-party-process,” Philip J. Crowley, a State Department spokesman, said in Washington. On Monday,the North Korean Foreign Ministry proposed “immediate” talkswith the United States to negotiate a peace treaty that would formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in a truce, leaving the Korean Peninsula technically in a state of war. The North said treaty talks could be held separately or be included inthe six-nation talks, which include the two Koreas, the United States, China, Russia and Japan. The talks have been in limbo since last spring, when North Korea withdrew to protest sanctions that were imposed after it tested its second nuclear device and some ballistic missiles. “We can discuss a peace treaty only after the six-party talks are reopened and there is progress in the denuclearization of North Korea,” Defense Minister Kim Tae-young of South Korea said at a news conference on Tuesday. “North Korea has a history of offering peace gestures with one hand while committing provocations with the other.” Washington also said the North must first return to the talks and take “affirmative steps towards denuclearization.” “Once they’re back within the process, once we have confidence that they’re meeting their obligations, then a wide range of other possible discussions open up,” Mr. Crowley said. The stance reflects the allies’ suspicions that North Korea is trying to deflect the focus of the talks, which have so far focused on ending the North’s nuclear weapons program. North Korea says that asking it to give up its nuclear capabilities before it feels safe under a formal peace treaty is “like a gangster trying to disarm us at gunpoint.”

SEOUL, South Korea  —North KoreaandSouth Koreaplan to open modernized military telephone lines next week to improve cross-border communications, the South Korean Defense Ministry said  Tuesday. The special telephone  lines serve as one of the few official links between the two Koreas, which remain technically at war. The 1950-53 Korean War ended with a truce, not a formal peace treaty. The old copper lines were outdated and sometimes failed to function, holding up border clearances for South Korean workers traveling to and from an industrial complex operated by both countries the North Korean border town of  Kaesong. South Korea offered in 2007 to finance upgrades to the hot lines, but North Korea dithered, even temporarilysevering the lines in Marchin protest against joint United States-South Korean military exercises.The lines were reopenedafter a nine-day interruption. South Korea sent fiber-optic cables and other materials to the North two months ago, and since then both sides have been laying the new lines. The announcement came a day afterthe North threatenedto fire artillery shells into the waters off the west coast of the Korean peninsula, a move that could ratchet up tensions between the two countries over the disputed western sea border. Last month, two naval vessels from the North and Southexchanged firein a brief skirmish that left one North Korean sailor dead.

The military threat presented by North Korea has not diminished despite early steps ordered by Pyongyang to begin dismantling its nuclear weapons program, the South Korean defense minister declared.

SEOUL,South Korea, Nov. 7 — The military threat presented byNorth Koreahas not diminished despite early steps by Pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear weapons program, the South Korean defense minister said today. During a news conference with the visiting American defense secretary, South Korea’s minister of national defense, Kim Jang-soo, said there was no clear intelligence that the Communist North had halted its pursuit of “asymmetrical weapons.” “In order for us to change our view of the situation, we would need very real and very tangible military intelligence to that effect,” Mr. Kim said. “What is certain is that North Korea is continuing to pursue the acquisition of asymmetrical weapons. We cannot conclude that the threat from North Korea has been reduced.” Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, midway through a weeklong series of meetings in China, South Korea and Japan, said the United States “would welcome, and do welcome, the beginning of disablement of nuclear facilities in the North.” Earlier this week a senior State Department expert on Korea said he had confirmation that North Korea had begun to disable its nuclear facilities at the main Yongbyon complex, 60 miles north of Pyongyang. But Mr. Gates  cautioned that much work remains to make certain that North Korea has surrendered its nuclear weapons and its weapons development programs. He said North Korea must offer to disclose all of its nuclear weapons facilities and nuclear weapons activities. “So there are several steps in this process,” Mr. Gates said. “Of course, the object is the denuclearization of North Korea. So we are started on a path, but we are far from reaching our destination.” Sung Kim, the State Department official who visited the Yongbyon complex, said North Korean officials were “very cooperative” and that the effort was “off to a good start.” North Korea turned off the reactor at Yongbyon in July and pledged to disable it — but not dismantle it — by the end of this year. In exchange, North Korea will receive a number of concessions, including energy assistance, in a deal negotiated with the United States, China, Japan, South Korea and Russia. The agreement, first reached in February, also grants North Korea a number of political concessions. But Mr. Gates said today that North Korea’s desire to be removed from the American roster of terrorist states would be fulfilled only when the North has met a list of official criteria — implying that such a determination had not yet been made. Mr. Gates, at the conclusion today of annual security talks with South Korea, said that the North Korean conventional and nuclear threat remained “the focal point” of an alliance between Washington and Seoul that he described as “strong and vibrant.” North Korea has about one million people in its armed forces and conducted its first nuclear detonation in October 2006. The size of the American military force stationed in South Korea has been slowly diminishing. Three years ago, 37,500 American military personnel were in South Korea, the only permanent base the United States operates on the mainland of East Asia. One American brigade formerly based in South Korea deployed to Iraq in 2004. The current American presence here is 28,000, a figure that will drop to 25,000 by 2012. South Korea fields 680,000 in its armed forces, which are among the most modern in Asia. In 2012, the South Korean military is to take over wartime operational control of its own forces, a command responsibility previously exercised by the American four-star general here. Underscoring the importance of the alliance with South Korea, Mr. Gates was joined for the meetings here by Adm. Mike Mullen, the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Adm. Timothy Keating, commander of American forces in the Pacific; and Gen. B. B. Bell, the American commander in South Korea. In advance of the defense secretary’s arrival, senior Pentagon officials made clear that Mr. Gates’s visit was to reaffirm a strong relationship. But these officials also said that Mr. Gates and his delegation were consciously seeking to avoid any statements on national security issues that might influence presidential elections here next month.

South Korea’s Peace Dam is a $429 million monument to the cold war politics on the divided Korean peninsula.
==::==
2007-08-28T00:00:00Z
==::==
HWACHEON,South Korea— In 1986, as South Korea was busy preparing for its largest ever international event, the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, North Korean soldiers broke ground on a gigantic dam just above the Demilitarized Zone. As South Koreans wondered what their unpredictable Communist neighbors were up to, the military dictator of South Korea, Chun Doo-hwan, offered his own terrifying possibility: a killer flood. In response to the so-called water-bomb scare, South Korean television networks broadcast artists’ conceptions of monstrous walls of water unleashed from the North Korean dam, wiping out most of Seoul, 120 miles downstream, with the impact of a nuclear explosion during the Olympics. So South Korea built a dam of its own. Even schoolchildren joined the fund-raising campaign to construct a protective bulwark against the threat. Today, the  “Peace Dam” — begun in 1987, abandoned halfway through as a misguided cold war scheme, then revived and completed in 2005 — stands here, a 410-foot-high, 1,970-foot-wide rock and concrete hulk. There is no reservoir; the dam’s only function is to contain a possible deluge, by accident or design, from the  Imnam Dam in the North, 22 miles up the northern tributary of the Han River. “Like the two Koreas, the two dams are twin brothers, born at the same time, facing each other across DMZ,” said Lee Tae-ik, an official at Korea Water Resources Corporation, which maintains the South Korean dam. “The Peace Dam is an inevitable child of a divided nation.” The Peace Dam is a $429 million monument to the politics on the divided peninsula — its massive wall evocative of the challenge President Roh Moo-hyun of South Korea faces at a three-day  meeting between the nations’ leaders from Oct. 2 to Oct. 4 in Pyongyang,North Korea’s capital. At the meeting, Mr. Roh plans to urge the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, to scale down the tension and mistrust along the 150-mile-long border in return for economic incentives. In few places is the South Korean desire for peace, and the sometimes surreal manifestations of inter-Korean hostility, on better display than here in Hwacheon. “With 24,000 civilians vs. 36,000 soldiers, we are the most ‘military intensive’ county in South Korea,” said Choi Moon-soon, a Hwacheon official. “People here are very anti-Communist.” Here in Hwacheon, suspicion of North Korea is etched both into the landscape, which is dotted with minefields and tank traps and monuments built at some of the Korean War’s bloodiest battle sites, and in the minds of residents, who remember when Northern commandos crossed the border in 1992, killing three South Korean soldiers and eluding manhunts before escaping back to the North. A few miles northwest of the Peace Dam, an asphalt road, hacked into hillsides so remote that local residents claim to have sighted supposedly extinct tigers, winds past military outposts carrying slogans like, “If we fight, we will win” before coming to a dead end at the southern boundary of the DMZ. There, the South Korean army’s Seven Star Guard Post looms atop a mist-shrouded hill, part of the nearly two million-strong military forces on both sides of the border prepared to resume the war that was suspended with a cease-fire in 1953. When the war halted, the two sides agreed to create a demilitarized zone 2.5 miles wide. But at Seven Star, the DMZ is only one-fifth that, the result of the armies inching in over the years to get a better vantage point against their adversaries. “If the enemy comes within 50 meters of the borderline at the center of DMZ, we broadcast a warning three times,” said Capt. Kwon Seong-ho. “The moment the enemy steps on the borderline, we fire warning shots. The moment the enemy crosses it, we are licensed to kill.” Here the temperature soars to 97 degrees in summer and plunges to minus 33 degrees in winter. Off-duty soldiers play a form of soccer with a ball attached to a rope. As Captain Kwon explained, they don’t want to wade into a minefield to retrieve a ball. Even along this time-frozen frontier, there are abundant signs of how the two sides have diverged after decades of pursuing different ideologies and policies. The Southern barracks are outfitted with satellite TV, karaoke machines and showers. At night, the Southern fence is lighted up, while the energy-starved North sinks into darkness. After the first  meeting between the Koreas, in 2000, South Korea’s president at the time, Kim Dae-jung, declared that there would be “no more war” in Korea, beginning an unprecedented mood of reconciliation. But two years later, in the middle of the World Cup soccer finals, which took place in South Korea and Japan, the North and South Korean Navies engaged in a bloody skirmish on their disputed western sea border. After South Korea rushed to complete the first phase of the Peace Dam in time for the 1988 Olympics, it became clear that it had misjudged the North’s intentions. The so-called water offensive never came. The North used its Imnam Dam to reroute water to a hydroelectric power plant on its east coast. In 1993, government auditors concluded that President Chun had exaggerated the dam’s threat to mute political discontent at home. The Peace Dam became a symbol of cold war hysteria. Then, in early 2002, only months before the World Cup finals, satellite pictures showed cracks in the clumsily built North Korean dam. “It was terrifying when, out of the blue, a huge wall of muddy water and chunks of ice tumbled down from the North,” said Mr. Choi, the Hwacheon official. The North repaired its dam. But South Korea resumed construction on its own dam and finished it in 2005. When the North-South  meeting was announced, the mayor of Hwacheon, Chung Kap-chol, wrote to President Kim urging that the two sides address a growing water dispute between the two Koreas. Imnam Dam has reduced water inflow in the Han River by 12 percent, threatening its ecosystem and contributing to water shortages in the Seoul metropolitan area. Some suggest that South Korea shut the Peace Dam’s four sluice gates, to fill up a reservoir for drinking water. But this could cause flooding on the North Korean side. The Peace Dam, like its Northern counterpart, could be a potent weapon. “Once peace finally comes to Korea, the Peace Dam will function like a normal dam,” says a public relations video at a Peace Dam museum. “Until then, the Peace Dam stands here, silently suffering the burden of national division.”

SEOUL, South Korea — In an unexpected diplomatic overture that could lead to the resumption of negotiations withNorth Korea, the president ofSouth Koreasaid Wednesday that he would endorse restarting the six-nation talks aimed at dismantling the North’snuclear weaponsprogram. After months of tensions in which the two Koreas exchanged artillery fire and increasingly bellicose threats that seemed to push the peninsula to the brink of war, President Lee Myung-bak said that his government favored multilateral talks in 2011 “to terminate the North Korean nuclear program,” preferably by 2012. The impoverished North has vowed to become “a strong and prosperous country” by 2012, the 100th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il-sung, North Korea’s founder. To South Korean politicians and foreign leaders, the North’s remarks about this promised transformation are vague, improbable and worrisome. The participants in the six-nation talks are the two Koreas, China, the United States, Japan and Russia. Hosted in the past by Beijing, the talks broke down in April 2009 when the North withdrew from the process and ejected inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear watchdog. Mr. Lee’s remarks came before a presentation by the Foreign Ministry about its goals for next year. The Unification Ministry and Defense Ministry also reported to Mr. Lee on Wednesday, during private sessions at the Blue House, the presidential office here. An artillery exchangebetween the Koreas on Nov. 23raised tensions on the peninsula to their highest level since the end of the Korean War in 1953. Shelling by the North killed two marines and two civilians on the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong, eight miles off the North Korean coast in disputed waters of the Yellow Sea. Many South Koreans feared an outbreak of war, and a nationwide civil defense drill was conducted. Since the attack, South Korea has also held a series of military exercises, including joint maneuvers with a United States naval force. Tensions eased whenthe North shrugged off the South’s live-fire artillery exerciseon Yeonpyeong on Dec. 20. Contributing to the frayed relations was North Korea’s revelation of a new and sophisticated uranium-enrichment plant that North Korean nuclear officials said was operational. They also showed visiting American scientists a light-water reactor still under construction. Against this fractious backdrop, Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a former American ambassador to the United Nations, made an unofficial visit to Pyongyang, the North’s capital, to try to defuse the inter-Korean tensions. North Korean officials told him that they would sell 12,000 plutonium rods to South Korea as a gesture of good faith and that they would admit United Nations monitors to the main Yongbyon nuclear complex. It was unclear whether those offers might have prompted Mr. Lee’s overture on Wednesday. But a senior administration official in Seoul tempered any expectations for an imminent breakthrough, saying, “North Korea has never been sincere in opening up its nuclear program to the rest of the world, including the six-party members.” The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on nuclear issues. If there was a tone of conciliation in Mr. Lee’s comments about new nuclear talks, there was also some tough talk on Wednesday about the government’s more muscular military stance toward North Korea. The Defense Ministry, in a biennial white paper scheduled to be released Thursday, will officially refer to the North Korean government and military as “an enemy,” officials said. That characterization is stronger than the previous description of the North as a “direct and serious threat.” It remains to be seen how the United States and Japan will respond to Mr. Lee’s comments about new multilateral discussions.

Ayheon SEOUL, South Korea — Air-raid sirens blared, traffic stopped, fighter planes roared overhead and schoolchildren were hustled into subway stations on Wednesday asSouth Korea, still tense after an artillery exchange withNorth Koreathree weeks ago, held its biggest civil defense drill in decades. “Such a large-scale drill was the first of its kind since 1975,” said the mayor of Seoul, Oh Se-hoon, shortly after the exercise ended. “During previous drills, people were not forced to head to shelters or underground facilities. They were just encouraged to do so.” Mr. Oh, who said the drill was conducted in a “swift but orderly” manner, added that “fighter jets disguised as the enemy flying across the city to simulate airstrikes made the drill more realistic.” The nationwide exercise, which began at 2 p.m. and lasted 20 minutes, was organized after the North Korean artillery strike on Nov. 23 on South Korea’s Yeonpyeong Island. Two marines and two civilians were killed, and the episode rattled the peninsula and the region. The United States and South Korea quickly staged joint military exercises in the Yellow Sea, and live-fire military drills have continued almost unabated in the South ever since. South Korea used to hold civil defense drills on the 15th of nearly every month, although in the late 1990s, as North-South relations began to improve, the drills became less frequent and almost casual. Park Tae-gyun, a history professor at Seoul National University, said the exercises were once taken seriously, particularly by those old enough to have firsthand memories of the Korean War, which ended in 1953 with an armistice, not a full peace treaty. “The drills were held every month, even in the night,” Mr. Park, 45, said. “We turned off all our lights, as if to deter a North Korean Air Force attack. Elementary and middle school students had to go underground.” Mr. Park said he had received several text messages from university administrators to remind him of the drills. The National Emergency Management Agency also sent text messages to remind people through the nationwide cellphone networks. The agency said about 300,000 police officials and Civil Defense Corps members were enlisted to oversee Wednesday’s exercise around the country. In Seoul, corps monitors dressed in amber-colored jackets stopped traffic at intersections, firmly directed wayward citizens to shelters and herded schoolchildren into subway stations. When the sirens went off, hundreds of students from nearby schools streamed into the Ahyeon subway station, on the No. 2 Green Line in Seoul. Middle school students shouted and giggled, and several boys kicked a soccer ball on their way down to a trackside shelter. One 11-year-old boy stopped at a Dunkin’ Donuts shop inside the station to buy glazed tofu. But older students from Ahyeon Polytechnic School were more restrained. Wearing cotton face masks they walked quickly, led by placard bearers, from their school building into the underground station. “They were a little scared and a little nervous,” said a teacher, Hyun Jung-ya, after the drill ended. “Since Yeonpyeong, they know we have a problem in this country. We talk to them about it. They are taking it seriously.” Most office workers went to shelters and basements in their buildings. Workers at the Samsung headquarters in central Seoul, for example, were sent to the basement cafeteria and sub-basements in the company’s gleaming skyscraper. When the first sirens sounded, Mr. Oh, the mayor, said, he went to the City Hall subway station to check on the equipment and procedures there. “Everything was perfect,” he said. “All serene.”

A South Korean Christian pastor who visited North Korea without government permission was arrested on Friday during his trip home across the heavily guarded border between the countries.

SEOUL, South Korea — A South Korean Christian pastor who has fueled a bitter debate by visitingNorth Koreawithout government permission was arrested on Friday during his trip home across the heavily guarded border between the countries. The pastor, the Rev. Han Sang-ryol, a self-styled “unification activist,” was waving a “one-Korea” flag that showed an undivided Korean Peninsula as he stepped across the military demarcation line at the border village of Panmunjom, government officials said. He was immediately whisked away by South Korean authorities for interrogation. During its so-called sunshine policy of engaging North Korea from 1998 to 2008, the government in Seoul often approved, and sometimes encouraged, visits by South Koreans to the North. But Mr. Han’s illegal trip has become a thorny issue between the Koreas because it coincides with the deepest chill in inter-Korean relations in years and flouts the South’s new policy of controlling exchanges with the North. The current inter-Korean tensions have helped turn Mr. Han’s trip into perhaps the most contested one by a South Korean since several activists defied Seoul’s draconian anti-Communist laws and entered North Korea in the late 1980s. On the northern side of the border, 200 North Koreans bid farewell to Mr. Han, chanting slogans and singing songs about the unification of the Koreas, which were divided at the end of World War II. In the South, people were divided over Mr. Han’s trip. “Send him back to North Korea!” yelled 1,000 people who rallied near the border, according to local television reports. Many of them were elderly military veterans in uniforms, and some burned North Korean flags. South Korean news outlets also showed a rival gathering nearby, a smaller group protesting Mr. Han’s arrest and waving flags showing an undivided peninsula. Police officers were sent to prevent clashes between the groups. Mr. Han, a vocal supporter of engagement with North Korea and a frequent leader of protests against American policy toward it, entered through China on June 12. Tensions between the countries had already escalated because of a South Korean warship that exploded and sank in March, killing 46 sailors. The South blames the North for the sinking of the ship, theCheonan, but the North denies involvement. Mr. Han attended rallies and meetings in North Korea during which he questioned the South Korean investigative report on the ship sinking and accused the government of President Lee Myung-bak of raising tensions. The Lee government became upset because North Korean officials used Mr. Han’s trip and comments to attack the South. Mr. Han, who said he was visiting North Korea to promote reconciliation and unification, insisted on returning home through Panmunjom, where an armistice was signed in 1953 to end the fighting in the Korean War. Mr. Han met Kim Yong-nam, president of the presidium of the North’s Parliament, on Thursday, according to the North’s state-run news agency, KCNA. Calling Mr. Han a “reunification champion,” the news agency denounced Mr. Han’s arrest as “fascist suppression.” “I do not feel lonely and fearful as I am joined by fellow countrymen in the North and the South and abroad,” Mr. Han said at a farewell ceremony in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, earlier on Friday. North Korea, one of the world’s most closed countries, selects its guests carefully. Last year it sentenced two American journalists to 12 years of hard labor forillegally entering the North. The reporters were released after five months, but only after former President Bill Clintonpaid a visitto the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, in Pyongyang last August. North Korea also arrested Robert Park, a Korean-American Christian who crossed over from China in December to call attention to the dismal conditions at the North’s prison camps. It expelled Mr. Park after 40 days. But it is still holding Aijalon Mahli Gomes, an American from Boston who illegally entered the North in support of Mr. Park. Then this month, Pyongyang allowed an American teenager to spend a week in the North to promote his idea for a “children’s peace forest” in the demilitarized zone dividing the Koreas. A South Korean who visits the North without government approval can face several years in prison under the South’s National Security Law, written during the cold war. Several South Koreans have defied the law and made illegal trips. The most famous case was Im Su-kyong, a student activist who entered the North in 1989 and was arrested upon returning home through Panmunjom. She was sentenced to five years in prison but was paroled in 1992. Two other prominent South Koreans — Moon Ik-hwan, a Christian pastor,  and Seo Kyong-won, an opposition lawmaker — were sentenced to prison for illegally visiting the North in the late 1980s. Hwang Sok-yong, a novelist, was arrested in 1993 for illegally entering the North five times between 1989 and 1991. These visits, inspired by a global détente after decades of cold war enmity, featured prominently in North Korean propaganda and also helped lead to protests by students calling for reconciliation with the North. The conservative government responded with police crackdowns. It was not until 2000 that a South Korean president visited Pyongyang for the first summit meeting between the Koreas. That leader, Kim Dae-jung, introduced the “sunshine policy,” which focused on exchanges and cooperation with the North. The approach was jettisoned by President Lee, who took office in early 2008, vowing to cut off aid and exchanges until the North agreed to give up itsnuclear weaponsprogram.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreaconfirmed on Thursday that it was holding a South Korean fishing boat and its seven-man crew, 11 days after the craft was detained by the North Korean navy off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula. The crew members — four South Koreans and three Chinese — “confessed” to fishing illegally in North Korean waters on Aug. 8, the North’s state-run news agency, KCNA, reported. The agency report did not clarify whether or when North Korea would release the crew.South Koreahad been asking the North to free the crew, but until Thursday, the North had not even acknowledged the ship’s capture. The episodecame amid high tension between the two Koreas following the March 26 sinking of a South Korean warship. The South blames the North for the sinking, which killed 46 sailors, while the North denies it. South Korea and the United States are currently holding their second joint military exercise in a month. They plan to conduct a new antisubmarine exercise next month in waters off the peninsula’s west coast, where the warship sank. North Korea vowed to retaliate, calling the drills warmongering.

For those who survived the Korean War, the sight of the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier George Washington leading a fleet of U.S. and South Korean ships along the eastern coast of the Korean Peninsula on the 57th anniversary of the temporary armistice is alarming indeed. In a move intended to punish North Korea for its alleged sinking of a South Korean warship, the Cheonan, the United States and South Korea are flexing their military might by mobilizing American and South Korean ships, over 200 aircraft, including the F-22 Raptor fighters, and 8,000 troops. If anything, the military provocation by all sides demonstrates the frailty of the Korean armistice agreement, which was signed by North Korea, China and the United States on July 27, 1953. It shows how much the absence of a peace treaty could trigger another war, not just between the two Koreas, but between the United States and China. To be clear, contrary to the rhetoric of promises of engagement emanating from the White House, President Barack Obama is continuing his predecessor’s hard-line policies of sanctions and military posturing. These have been counterproductive and have done nothing to reduce the risk of nuclear proliferation. Worse, they are actually increasing the chances of military conflict in northeast Asia. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton announced last week during a visit to the demilitarized zone that the United States plans to impose greater sanctions on North Korea. Although Secretary Clinton asserts that “[t]hese measures are not directed at the people of North Korea,” it is in fact the North Korean people who will suffer from U.S. sanctions. The freezing of North Korean assets, in particular, restricts the country’s ability to purchase the materials it needs to meet the basic food, healthcare, sanitation and educational needs of its people. Moreover, sanctions have not succeeded in pressuring North Korea to disarm. To the contrary, North Korea considers economic sanctions to be an act of war, and has responded by accelerating its nuclear weapons program. History has taught us that military posturing, such as the current military exercises, do not change North Korea’s policies. Instead, Pyongyang views the maneuvers as a test of its will, and has warned that it will counter them with “a physical response” of its own. Worse, Beijing now views the U.S.-South Korea military exercises as too close to its own shores and as a threat to China’s security and that of the region. The international community’s response to tensions arising from the sinking of the South Korean naval vessel was clearly outlined in the July 9th United Nations Security Council statement, which calls urgently “for full adherence to the Korean Armistice Agreement” and “the settlement of outstanding issues” through “direct dialogue and negotiation” so as to avert “escalation.” The Obama administration should heed the U.N. Security Council by moving from the war room to the negotiating table. North Korea has agreed to return to the six-party talks. The Obama administration should do the same. As the former U.S. ambassador to South Korea James Laney put it, what should be “at the top of the agenda ... in order to remove all unnecessary obstacles to progress ... is the establishment of a peace treaty to replace the truce that has been in place since 1953.” Koreans on the peninsula and throughout the diaspora say 60 years of enmity and war is enough. As a Korean-American, I cannot ignore the heart-wrenching stories of family division, especially of those elderly people who may soon pass away without reuniting with their families. I don’t know a single Korean, either in the United States or in Korea, who isn’t deeply moved when they see siblings embrace for the first time in a half century. Our national leaders can continue to choose war and division or a path of peace and reconciliation. We must urge them to choose wisely.

SINGAPORE —South Koreahas asked theUnited Nations Security Councilto take action againstNorth Koreaover the sinking of a South Korean warship, the South Korean president said Friday. “It is important for us to encourage North Korea to admit its wrongdoing,” President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea said at an international security conference here. “It must pledge to never again engage in such reprehensible action. This is the interest of peace, this is in the interest of North Korea.” South Korea did not specify what action it was seeking from the Security Council for the sinking of its warship, theCheonan, which it says was torpedoed by the North on March 26. But any Security Council action would have to be approved by China, which holds a veto in the Council and is an ally and major trading partner of North Korea. Beijing has yet to weigh in on thereportby a South Korean-led international investigative team that concluded that North Korea was responsible for the ship’s sinking, which killed 46 South Korean sailors and raised tensions between the Koreas to their highest level in years. In a letter submitted to the Council on Friday, South Korea asked that it “respond in a manner appropriate to the gravity of North Korea’s military provocation,” the South Korean ambassador to the United Nations, Park In-kook, said, adding that the action should be strong enough to deter any similar attack in the future. Meanwhile, the United States defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, said that joint military exercises with South Korea might be delayed until after the Security Council met on the issue. The possible delay of the joint exercises was seen in South Korea as an effort to avoid provoking China. The Security Council is in the midst of negotiating the final language on new sanctions against Iran, expected next Thursday, and on the reaction to the Israeli raid on the  flotilla bound for Gaza, so any action on North Korea will most likely wait at least a week, Council diplomats said. South Korea has been lobbying its allies to bring some form of Security Council censure against the North since May 20, when it formally accused the North of sinking the ship. In Singapore on Friday, Mr. Lee portrayed the sinking as part of a historical pattern of North Korean aggression rather than as an isolated event, saying that North Korea had “repeatedly attacked us time and time again.” He cited the 1983 North Korean attack on South Korean cabinet members in Burma, now Myanmar, that killed 17 South Korean officials, and the 1987 bombing of a Korean Airlines jet that killed 115 people. Speaking to the same conference on Saturday morning, Mr. Gates echoed the point. “This sinking is far more than a single, isolated incident, with tragic results for the sailors and their families,” he said. “It is, rather, part of a larger pattern of provocative and reckless behavior.” He said that the United States would support action in the Security Council and that it was “assessing additional options to hold North Korea accountable.” But Chung Min Lee, a foreign policy adviser to President Lee, said that the  president “has basically told the North Koreans, ‘If you do this type of provocative act one more time, we will respond with some kind of military response.’ ”

President Obama intends to break the North’s behavior, but his approach may not be enough to avoid a conflict.

WASHINGTON USUALLY, there is a familiar cycle to Korea crises. Like a street gang showing off its power to run amok in a well-heeled neighborhood, the North Koreans  launch a missile over Japan or set off a nuclear test or  stage an attack — as strong evidence indicates  they did in March, when a South Korean warship was torpedoed. Expressions of outrage follow. So do vows that this time, the North Koreans will pay a steep price. In time, though, the United States andNorth Korea’s neighbors —  China, Japan,South Koreaand Russia — remind one another that they  have nothing to gain from a prolonged confrontation, much less a war. Gradually, sanctions get watered down. Negotiations reconvene. Soon the North hints it can be enticed or bribed into giving up a slice of its nuclear program. Eventually, the cycle repeats. The White House betting is that the latest crisis, stemming from the March attack, will also abate without much escalation. But there is more than a tinge of doubt. The big risk, as always, is what happens if the North Koreans make a major miscalculation. (It wouldn’t be their first. Sixty years ago, Mr. Kim’s father, Kim Il-sung, thought the West wouldn’t fight when he invaded the South. The result was the Korean War.) What’s more, the dynamic does feel different from recent crises. The South has a hardline government whose first instinct was to cut off aid to the North, not offer it new bribes. At the same time, the North is going through a murky, ill-understood succession crisis. AndPresident Obamahas made it clear he intends to break the old cycle. “We’re out of the inducements game,” one senior administration official, who would not discuss internal policy discussions on the record, said last week. “For 15 years at least, the North Koreans have been in the extortion business, and the U.S. has largely played along. That’s over.” That may change the North’s behavior, but it could backfire. “There’s an argument that in these circumstances, the North Koreans may perceive that their best strategy is to escalate,” says Joel Wit, a former State Department official who now runs a Web site that follows North Korean diplomacy. The encouraging thought  is the history of cooler heads prevailing  in every crisis  since the Korean War. There was no retaliation after a 1968 raid on South Korea’s presidential palace; or when the North seized the American spy ship Pueblo days later; or in 1983 when much of the South Korean cabinet was killed in a bomb explosion in Rangoon, Burma; or in 1987 when a South Korean airliner was blown up by North Korean agents, killing all 115 people on board. So what if this time is different? Here are five situations in which good sense might not prevail. An Incident at Sea Ever since an armistice ended the Korean War, the two sides have argued over   — and from time to time skirmished over — the precise location of the “Northern Limit Line,” which divides their territorial waters. That was  where the naval patrol shipCheonanwas  sunk in March. So first on the Obama administration’s list of concerns is another incident at sea that might turn into a prolonged firefight.  Any heavy engagement could draw in the United States,  South Korea’s chief ally, which is responsible for taking command if a major conflict  breaks out. What worries some officials is the chance of an intelligence failure in which the West misreads North Korea’s willingness and ability to escalate. The failure would not be unprecedented. Until a five-nation investigation concluded that the Cheonan had been torpedoed,  South Korea and its allies did not think  the North’s mini-submarine fleet was powerful enough to  sink a fully armed South Korean warship. Shelling the DMZ American and South Korean war planners  still work each day to refine how they would react  if North Korea’s 1.2 million-man army poured  over the Demilitarized Zone, 1950s-style. Few really expect that to happen —  the South Koreans  build and sell expensive condos between Seoul and the DMZ  — but that doesn’t mean the planning is  unjustified. In one retaliatory measure last week, South Korea  threatened to resume propaganda broadcasts from loudspeakers at the DMZ. In past years, such blaring denunciations, of Kim Jong-il’s economic failures, were heard only by North Korean guards and the wildlife that now occupies the no-man’s land. Still, the threat was enough to drive  the North’s leadership to  threaten to shell the loudspeakers. That, in turn, could lead to tit-for-tat exchanges of fire, and to a threat from  the North  to fire on  Seoul, which is within easy reach of mortars. If that happened,  thousands could die in frenzied flight from the city, and  investors in South Korea’s economy  would almost certainly  panic. American officials believe the South is now rethinking the wisdom of turning on the loudspeakers. A Power Struggle or Coup Ask American intelligence analysts  what could escalate  this or a future crisis, and they name a 27-year-old Kim Jong-un, the youngest of Kim Jong-il’s three sons, and the father’s choice to succeed him.  Little is known about him, but his main qualifications for the job may be that he is considered  less corrupt or despised than his two older brothers. One senior American intelligence official described the succession crisis this way: “We can’t think of a bigger nightmare than a third generation of the Kim family” running the country with an iron hand, throwing opponents into the country’s gulags, and mismanaging an economy that leaves millions starving. It is possible that on the issue of succession, many in the North Korean elite,  including in the military,   agree with the American intelligence official. According to some reports, they view Kim Jong-un as untested, and perhaps unworthy. “We’re seeing considerable signs of stress inside the North Korean system,”  another official reported. And that raises the possibility of more provocations — and potential miscalculations — ahead. One line of analysis is that the younger Kim has to put a few notches in his belt by ordering some attacks on the South, the way his father once built up a little credibility.  Another possibility is that internal fighting over the succession could bring wide-scale violence inside North Korea, tempting outside powers to intervene to stop the bloodshed. Curiously, when Kim Jong-il took the train to China a few weeks ago, his heir apparent did not travel with him.  Some experts read that as a sign that the Kim dynasty might fear a coup if both were out of the country — or that  it might not be wise to put father and son on the same track at the same time, because accidents do happen. An Internal Collapse America’s most enduring North Korea strategy isn’t a strategy at all;  it’s a prayer for the country’s collapse. Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy hoped for it. Dick Cheney tried to speed it. The regime has survived them all. But could the North collapse in the midst of the power struggle? Sure. And that is the one scenario that most terrifies the Chinese. It also explains why they keep pumping money into a neighbor they can barely stand. For China, a collapse would mean  a flood of millions of hungry refugees (who couldn’t flee south; there they are blocked by the minefield of the DMZ); it would also mean  the possibility of having South Korea’s military, and its American allies, nervously contending with the Chinese over who would occupy the territory of a fallen regime in order to stabilize the territory. China is deeply interested in North Korea’s minerals; the South Koreans may be as interested in North Korea’s small nuclear arsenal. A Nuclear Provocation With tensions high, American spy satellites are looking for evidence that the North Koreans are getting ready to test another nuclear weapon  —  just as they did in 2006 and 2009  —  or shoot off some more long-range missiles. It is a sure way to grab headlines and rattle the neighborhood. In the past, such tests have ratcheted up tension, and could do so again. But they are not the Obama administration’s biggest worry. As one of Mr. Obama’s top aides said months ago, there is reason to hope that the North will shoot off “a nuclear test every week,” since they are thought to have enough fuel for only eight to twelve. Far more worrisome would be a decision by  Pyongyang  to export its nuclear technology  and a failure by Americans to notice. For years, American intelligence agencies missed  evidence that the North was building a reactor in the Syrian desert, near the Iraq border. The Israelis found it, and wiped it out in an air attack in 2007. Now,  the search is on to find out if other countries are buying up North Korean technology or, worse yet, bomb fuel. (There are worries about Myanmar.) In short, the biggest worry is that North Korea  could decide that  teaching others how to build nuclear weapons would be the fastest, stealthiest way to defy a new American president who has declared that stopping proliferation is Job No. 1. It is unclear whether the American intelligence community would pick up the signals that it missed in Syria. And if it did, a crisis might not be contained in the Korean Peninsula; it could spread to the Middle East or Southeast Asia, or wherever else North Korea found its customers.

SEOUL, South Korea — With political and military tension increasing daily on the Korean Peninsula, Secretary of StateHillary Rodham Clintonsaid Wednesday that Washington would stand beside Seoul as it sought redress at the United Nations Security Council over whatSouth Koreacalls the North’s sinking of a South Korean warship. But Mrs. Clinton stopped short of detailing what measures would be sought at the Security Council, where China, a veto-wielding member and a North Korean ally, was likely to block attempts to impose new sanctions on the isolated North. “We’re very confident in the South Korean leadership, and their decision about how and when to move forward is one that we respect and will support,” Mrs. Clinton said at a news conference after meetings with the South Korean president,Lee Myung-bak, and Foreign Minister Yu Myung-hwan. “I believe that the Chinese understand the seriousness of this issue and are willing to listen to the concerns expressed by both South Korea and the United States.” She acknowledged a complicated task facing Washington and Seoul when she said the allies had to work on two tracks simultaneously. She spoke of the “immediate crisis” of the sinking that “requires a strong but  measured response” and of a “longer-term challenge of changing the direction ofNorth Korea, making a convincing case to everyone in the region to work together to achieve that outcome, denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and offering the opportunities for a better life for the people of the North.” North Korea has denied any rolein the sinking of the shipand the loss of 46 South Korean sailors. She also endorsed President Lee’s “right approach” in trying to avoiding “escalation and a broader conflict” while seeking international support to punish the North. “The key word” during the South Korean leaders’ meetings with Mrs. Clinton was her strategy of “strategic patience,” said Lee Dong-kwan, President Lee’s spokesman. “Another way to put it is that time is on our side,” the spokesman said after the president’s meeting with Mrs. Clinton. “We shouldn’t go for an impromptu response to each development but take a longer-term perceptive in shaping the situation around the Korean Peninsula.” Those comments followed an escalation of tension in the past week, with the Southcutting off most tradewith the North and the North responding by terminating all communications with the South and threatening to launch artillery shells across the border. On Wednesday, the North Korean military threatened to “completely block South Korean personnel and vehicles” from a joint industrial park in the North Korean town of Kaesong if the South carries out its plan to resume its psychological warfare against the North, mainly through propaganda broadcasts across the border. Continuing its sharp language, it also said that it would attack and destroy the propaganda loudspeakers to be put up along the border by the South, calling them a “military provocation.” Eight South Korean government officials returned to Seoul after they were expelled from Kaesong on Wednesday. But the South Korean government noted that, despite the North’s declaration that it was severing communications with the South, on Wednesday it followed its usual procedure of speaking through a military telephone line across the border to approve the entry of hundreds of workers from the South to work their regular shifts at the industrial complex. Neither country seemed to take the final step, at least yet, of dismantling theKaesong complex, the last sign of progress they made in improving relations over the past decade, and losing the tens of thousands of jobs it creates for the North. Mrs. Clinton called for “a strong but measured response” but did not elaborate on what would be the appropriate action at the Security Council. “This was an unacceptable provocation by North Korea and the international community has a responsibility and a duty to respond,” Mrs. Clinton said.

North and South Korea are in the World Cup for the first time, but an opportunity to unite people on the war-divided peninsula might have been scuttled when a South Korean warship was sunk in March.

SEOUL — With both North and South Korea in the World Cup for the first time, many on this war-divided peninsula were hoping that sports could cross the border and unite people. The feeling was so strong that some South Korean lawmakers even proposed to send a united group of fans to South Africa to support both Korean teams. But the sinking of a South Korean warship in March has shattered the mood and heightened tensions between the two nations, turning the World Cup into a missed opportunity less than a month before the games start. With Seoul expected to accuse the North Korea of firing a torpedo that sank the Southern ship, a diplomatic push to haul the North before the U.N. Security Council seems likely to follow. It’s a far different feeling than in 1966, when North Korea made its last appearance in the World Cup and — despite Cold War tensions — won over fans in Britain and elsewhere. The lightly regarded North Koreans produced a famous upset, eliminating Italy to advance to the quarterfinals. They took a 3-0 lead against Portugal, but the Portuguese — led by the legendary Eusebio — surged back with five goals to put an end to the North Koreans’ fairy-tale run. A lot has changed for the Koreas in the four decades since that tournament. Back then, the North had a stronger economy than the struggling South, and even their boots were the envy of the South Korean team. Today, the cash-strapped North relies on handouts to feed its people, while the South boasts the world’s 15th largest economy. Sanctions for its nuclear defiance have further strained the North and earned pariah status for the regime led by Kim Jong Il. Footage from 1966 shows the North Koreans interacting playfully with their newfound English fans as they wave and sign autographs, even bouncing local kids on their knees. In the years since, the regime has closed ranks and tightened its control over the population of 24 million. Few are allowed to leave the country, and those who do travel abroad — even the World Cup squad — are closely supervised by North Korean officials. Soccer could be one way to reach out to the North Koreans and break down political walls, said the former South Korean foreign minister, Han Sung-joo, citing the “Ping-Pong diplomacy” that between the U.S. and China in the 1970s. North Korea and South Korea remain locked in a state of war because they never signed a peace treaty at the close of the three-year Korean War in 1953. Sports, however, has been one arena where both sides have made fledgling efforts at reconciliation. At the 2000 Summer Olympics, athletes from the two Koreas walked into Stadium Australia together under a “unification flag” to an emotional standing ovation. Hopes were high that the Koreas might eventually field a united team. Last year, the blue-and-white unity flag fluttered in the packed stands at the World Cup Stadium in Seoul as North Korea played the South, with the home team’s exuberant fans cheering for both squads. Han, who now heads South Korea’s bid to host the World Cup in 2022, has a bold vision for the Koreas if the South wins: He wants to hold three or four games in North Korea. “It would be a good opportunity to bring North Korea into the mainstream,” he said. “Right now, North Korea is fairly isolated, and there’s still hatred between North and South Korea. This will contribute to both peace and the integration of Koreans both in North and South Korea.” Jong Tae Se, a North Korean striker , said holding World Cup games in the North would be “historic.” “It would be beyond our wildest dreams, and I would be happy and all Korean people would be happy,” Jong, who was born and raised in Japan but holds a North Korean passport, said last month. For now, North Korea’s hopes rest with the World Cup squad, the most visible ambassadors the nation has had in decades. Fans lined the streets to bid the men farewell, waving North Korean flags and bouquets for players known at home as “The Dagger,” “the Warrior” and “the Bulldozer.” “After 44 years, our players are going to the World Cup, and the North Korean people have great expectations of them,” Pyongyang resident Chon Sung Won told broadcaster APTN in the North Korean capital. But they face a daunting lineup: North Korea’s group contains Brazil, Portugal and the Ivory Coast. The North Koreans are tough and disciplined, but only Jong and two others play for clubs abroad; the rest are virtually unknown to the outside world. And the tensions with the South may cost North Korean fans the chance to see their team play. In the past, the South Korean government has covered the cost to beam World Cup footage to the North by satellite. Last year, the South Korean broadcaster SBS began the tricky process of negotiating with Pyongyang — by fax from Beijing — to offer the footage in exchange for access to the North Korean team. “The ship sinking in March put a heavy strain on inter-Korean relations, leading to a standstill in negotiations,” said Yang Cheol-hoon, head of the broadcaster’s inter-Korean cooperation department. Even in better times, North Koreans rarely were able to watch a full match, defectors say. Highlights of select games are shown on tape delay on North Korea’s one channel, said a woman who defected from the North last year and now lives in Seoul. In one filmmaker’s imagination, World Cup fever makes it as least as far as the Demilitarized Zone. Kye Yoon-shik recalled the frenzy on the streets of Seoul when South Korea co-hosted the event with Japan in 2002. “Thousands of people dressed in red, boulevards blocked off and the whole country coming together to cheer for the soccer team — I couldn’t help but wonder, ‘What’s going on on the other side of the border?”’ he said. “Did they watch the games at all? Were they cheering for us?” In his film “Dreams Come True,” to be released next week, North Korean soldiers posted to the DMZ rig up illicit broadcasts of South Korea’s historic advance to the semifinals in 2002. “This movie shows that we’re one people; it shows the Korean people’s love for one another,” Kye said. And who will he support when the World Cup begins? “It’s not every day that both Koreas make the World Cup,” he said. “Of course I’ll be cheering for the North Koreans.”

The United States said a naval skirmish would not deter it from sending an envoy to North Korea.

SEOUL — North Korea said Thursday that South Korea would pay a “dear price” for the naval clash on Tuesday that was the most serious between the countries in seven years, while South Korea sent additional warships near the site of the confrontation in a disputed sea border. “We do not want confrontation or tension, but we will never tolerate the aggressors’ brazen violation of our sacred territorial waters,” a North Korean state-run newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, said in a commentary carried by the official news agency, KCNA. “The warmongers who like to play with fire will surely pay a dear price,” it added. The South’s deployment came as its defense minister, Kim Tae-young, told lawmakers that President Lee Myung-bak was concerned about the possibility of retaliation by North Korea. After the two-minute clash on Tuesday, a North Korean patrol boat was engulfed in flames and smoke, while a South Korean naval vessel was only lightly damaged, South Korean officials said. There were no South Korean casualties. One North Korean officer was killed and three sailors were wounded, South Korean media reported. The North, which did not say whether its forces had sustained any casualties, demanded an apology from South Korea. Despite the growing tensions, the United States said earlier this week that President Barack Obama had decided to accept a North Korean invitation to send an envoy to North Korea to try to resolve disputes over the country’s nuclear weapons program. Analysts here said that with Mr. Obama visiting the region this week, the North Koreans might have intended to use the skirmish to strengthen their negotiating leverage. The clash “does not in any way affect our decision” to send the American envoy, Stephen Bosworth, to North Korea, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said in Singapore on Wednesday. Mr. Bosworth’s trip would represent the beginning of bilateral talks, a format that North Korea has coveted, and would be the Obama administration’s first direct dialogue with North Korea. Among Mr. Bosworth’s goals will be bringing the North Koreans back to six-nation nuclear disarmament talks, which the North quit earlier this year, American officials said. South Korea sent additional naval ships near the disputed waters off the west coast of the Korean Peninsula on Wednesday to deter any North Korean provocations, said a South Korean official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss military operations with the news media. He declined to discuss details of the deployment, but Yonhap, a South Korean news agency, citing an unidentified military source, said that two additional warships and a destroyer had been sent. The South has placed its 680,000-member military on heightened alert but has detected no unusual North Korean troop movements along the border, according to the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff. The clash on Tuesday erupted when South Korea sent patrol boats to the disputed sea border after detecting a North Korean patrol boat approaching waters the South has controlled since the Korean War ended in 1953. The North Korean boat ignored five warning broadcasts and sailed more than a mile into South Korean-held water. When the South Korean ships fired warning shots, the North Korean boat began attacking one of the South Korean ships, South Korean officials said.North Korea contended that its boat was on a routine mission in its own waters when it came under fire from South Korean ships and repelled them.North Korea said Thursday that the confrontation had represented a “deliberate and premeditated provocation” by the South Korean military to derail the planned talks between North Korea and the United States, as well as a budding “mood for reconciliation and cooperation” between the two Koreas. The episode underscored the thorny relations between the Koreas since Mr. Lee took office in early 2008 and adopted a tough approach toward North Korea.North Korea may have hoped that the clash would highlight its longstanding argument that the Korean War never officially ended, analysts in Seoul said.

SEOUL —North Koreaagreed to hold talks withSouth Korealater this week, officials in Seoul said Tuesday, even as the North was reportedly preparing to test more missiles following a barrage of five short-range missiles that it launched on Monday. Working-level officials from the two Koreas plan to meet Wednesday at a North Korean border city to discuss how to prevent floods in the Imjin River, which runs through their heavily armed border, said the Unification Ministry in Seoul. Six South Koreans were killed last month when North Korea released water from a dam upriver without notice, causing a flash flood. The North said the emergency release of water was necessary because rain and floodwaters threatened to breach the dam. Afterward, the South demanded an apology, in addition to talks to prevent such accidents. Separately, the Red Cross societies from both sides were set to meet Friday to discuss reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War. Two weeks ago, they organized a round of family reunions for the first time in two years, furthering the prospects of reconciliation between North and South Korea, whose relations have chilled over the North’s nuclear and missile tests earlier this year. In the past, South Korea shippedfood aidas a humanitarian gesture following such family reunions. North Korea is expected to seek food shipments during the new round of Red Cross talks this week. Meanwhile, the South Korean military detected indications that North Korea may be preparing to launch short-range missiles off its western coast, the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported on Tuesday, quoting an unidentified government source. The Defense Ministry in Seoul would not confirm the report. On Monday, North Korea launched five short-range missiles from its eastern coast, according to Yonhap and other South Korean media. The North Korean military launched two KN-02 surface-to-surface missiles, which have a range of 75 miles, from mobile launching pads on Monday morning and three in the afternoon, said Yonhap, quoting an unidentified government source. A South Korean military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters, confirmed that short-range missiles had been launched. The test-firings on Monday were the first in three months and were seen as both a provocation and a puzzle — an ominous reminder of the North’s military muscle but also confounding because Pyongyang has been trying to get Washington to start bilateral talks. The apparently mixed signals from North Korea came amid indications that the reclusive Communist country was ending months of hostilities toward the outside world and readying to return to the negotiating table, where it uses itsnuclear weaponsprograms as a bargaining chip to win aid and diplomatic concessions. The North has often mixed provocations with conciliatory gestures when it seeks to nudge the United States and other nations to the negotiating table.

SEOUL — In a sign of thawing relations on the divided Korean peninsula, elderly South Koreans were  to travel toNorth Koreaon Saturday to meet relatives they last saw during the 1950-53 Korean War. The meetings will bring together Koreans desperate to be reunited with their families, even if for only three days. The reunions, arranged by both governments, are the first such gatherings in nearly two years. Ninety-seven South Koreans, some in wheelchairs, will cross the border on Saturday and meet their North Korean relatives for three days at the Diamond Mountain resort,  just inside North Korea on the eastern coast of the peninsula. From Tuesday to Thursday of next week, 99 North Koreans will have similar reunions with their South Korean relatives, also at Diamond Mountain. The two rounds of reunions will bring together a total of 910 Koreans. They will spend most of their time together in the presence of North Korean minders who will monitor — their conversations. The s have previously been a barometer of the political mood on the divided peninsula. The two Koreas began reunions after their first summit in 2000. But the program was  suspended in  late 2007 as relations soured over the North’s nuclear and missile tests. Then in late August, as it began reaching out to the South, North Korea abruptly agreed to resume the events.

SEOUL,South Korea—North Koreaon Saturday released four South Korean fishermen it had held for a month, in another move to reach out to its rivals after months of bellicosity. The North returned the four-man crew and its 29-ton fishing vessel at the sea border off the Korean Peninsula’s east coast. The South Korean boat was seized on July 30 after it strayed into North Korean waters when its satellite navigation system malfunctioned. The North’s recent barrage of conciliatory gestures has been surprising, even to South Korean officials familiar with the fickle pattern in North Korea’s diplomacy. Analysts say the overtures indicate that the North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, has regained confidence about his health and grip on power. He was reported to have had a stroke last August. “North Korea has suddenly become a nice guy, reaching across the table to grab South Korea’s hand,” said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior fellow atthe Sejong Institutenear Seoul. “South Korea fears it might be dragged into a relationship it doesn’t want. So it’s balking, pushing back its chair from the table.” North Korea’s charm offensive began when former President Bill Clinton visited Pyongyang, the North’s capital, on Aug. 4 to secure the release of two American journalists held there on charges of illegal entry. Since then, North Korea has released a South Korean worker held for five months on charges of denouncing Communist rule, lifted restrictions on border traffic and promised to resume South Korean tours to scenic spots in the North. It also sent a high-level delegation to the funeral of former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung. When President Lee Myung-bak balked at meeting the group, the delegates extended their stay to win an audience with him and relay Kim Jong-il’s wish to improve ties. The mood is worlds apart from that of only three months ago. In April, the North launched a long-range rocket, quit six-nation nuclear disarmament talks, expelled nuclear monitors and restarted a plutonium plant. In May, it tested its second nuclear device. “The change in Pyongyang’s approach means that Kim Jong-il has now become confident about his health,” said Kim Yong-hyun, an analyst at Dongguk University in Seoul. His hard-line military had grown bolder as uncertainty deepened about the North Korean leader’s health, heightening tensions with the outside world. Analysts said that helped Mr. Kim tighten his grip at home while he reportedly began grooming Kim Jong-un, the youngest of his three sons, as his heir. Mr. Kim looked gaunt after the stroke. But by meeting Mr. Clinton and laterHyun Jeong-eun, the chairwoman of the South’s Hyundai conglomerate, in Pyongyang, and increasing his visits to factories and military units by 50 percent in the first half of this year, Mr. Kim showed he was healthy enough to remain in charge. “Kim Jong-il got the power elite to support his son,” said Mr. Cheong, the analyst at the Sejong Institute. Now he must get his people to accept the son. To do that, he needs food for the hungry people and breakthroughs in external relations that can be attributed to his son.” But the North’s “tactical appeasing gestures” disguise its “strategic goal” of both improving ties with the United States, South Korea and other neighbors and being accepted as a nuclear power, according to Park Hyong-joong, an analyst at the government-runKorea Institute for National Unificationin Seoul. Washington has been mustering international support for United Nations sanctions intended to strangle the North’s arms trade, which is an important source of hard currency for the North’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs. United States and South Korean officials fear the North may be using its current overtures to undermine international consensus for the need to enforce sanctions. They say they are determined to break the old pattern of rewarding the North’s on-again, off-again nuclear strategy with aid and diplomatic incentives. South Korea says it will not repeat the old format of dialogue with the North that had provided aid but failed to dismantle the North’s nuclear program. On Thursday, the State Department said it had no immediate plan to send an envoy to North Korea. Such a trip would allow North Korea to open the bilateral discussions it has long sought while continuing to shun six-nation talks, a forum Washington prefers. Analysts say they expect the North to continue its recent tack. Mr. Kim has promised his people that he will rebuild the economy by 2012. That achievement would make the dynastic transfer of power to his son more popular domestically, but require better ties with the outside world.

The resumption of cross-border family reunions marks a rare gesture of reconciliation after two years of tension.

SEOUL,South Korea— In a further sign of thawing relations, North and South Korea agreed Friday to hold a new round of family reunions next month to allow hundreds of elderly Koreans to meet their family members for the first time since the Korean War separated them nearly 60 years ago. Also on Friday,North Koreaagreed to release four South Korean fishermen on Saturday, the South’s Unification Ministry said in a statement. The fishermen have been held in North Korea since their boat drifted into the North’s waters on July 30 after developing a malfunction in its navigation system. The two Koreas have not held family reunions for nearly two years. Their resumption and the release of the fishermen will mark rare gestures of reconciliation after two years of tension, which culminated with a North Korean nuclear test in May and subsequent United Nationssanctions. With the two agreements, North Korea appeared to be pursuing what some analysts in Seoul have dubbed a  “charm offensive.”  After months of belligerent statements and provocative moves, such as a nuclear test and a series of missile launchings, North Korea has recently begun softening its tone in what analysts said was an attempt to draw the United States and South Korea to the negotiating table. In recent weeks, North Korea has released two American journalists and a South Korean worker, all of whom were held in the North for months on charges of hostile acts. It also sent a delegation to the funeral of the former South Korean leader Kim Dae-jung last week. For years, North Korea has been alternating brinkmanship and conciliatory gestures in dealing with Seoul. So far, however, it has not signaled any change in its pursuit of nuclear weapons, the primary concern of the United States and South Korean governments. According to the deal on reunions struck after three days of talks between Red Cross officials from both sides, 100 South Koreans will travel to the North to meet their North Korean relatives from Sept. 26 to 28. The talks were held at the Diamond Mountain resort in southeastern North Korea, where the family reunions are scheduled to take place. From Sept. 29 to Oct. 1, 100 North Koreans will travel to Diamond Mountain to meet their South Korean relatives. After their first summit meeting in 2000, the two Koreas held regular family reunions. North Korea suspended them after President Lee Myung-bak, a hard-liner on the North, took office in early 2008. But North Korea has begun reaching out to Seoul and Washington in recent weeks. Since Red Cross talks were announced this week, elderly South Koreans have been visiting the Red Cross Society in Seoul to apply for reunions. In South Korea,  100 people are to be selected by lottery. The list will be sent to the North Korean authorities, who will then locate their relatives in the South — perhaps just one person, or a few — and the authorities will bring them to Diamond Mountain. The same basic process will apply to the North Korean side, although the North is said to give priority to citizens who are loyal to the Communist Party.

The agreement for talks on a joint industrial complex set up the first official dialogue between the countries in a year amid tensions over the North’s recent rocket launching.

SEOUL,South Korea(AP) — South Korea on Sunday acceptedNorth Korea’s proposal for talks on a troubled joint industrial complex, setting up the first official dialogue between the countries in a year amid tensions over the North’s recent rocket launching. A Unification Ministry spokeswoman  said officials of the two nations would meet Tuesday in the border town of Kaesong to discuss the factory complex. South Korea said Saturday that the North had made the surprise call for a meeting. The industrial zone on the northern side of the border is the last major joint project between the nations and an important source of foreign currency for the impoverished North’s  regime. Ties  have been strained since President Lee Myung-bak, a conservative with a tougher approach to the North than his predecessor, took office in Seoul last year. North Korea responded by cutting off ties. The North has restricted access to the industrial complex by tightening border controls, raising concerns among participating South Korean companies about the project’s viability. The meeting comes amid rising tensions over the North’s rocket launching and its weeks-long detention of a South Korean man in Kaesong accused of denouncing the North’s political system. North Korea has expelled international monitors and vowed to quit six-nation disarmament talks and restart its nuclear program to protest the United Nations Security Council’s condemnation of the April 5 launching. North Korea insists it sent a satellite into space, but regional powers and the United States said that nothing reached orbit and that the launching was a test of long-range missile technology. Sunday’s announcement came a day after North Korea’s military warned South Korea to stay out of a United States-led security initiative aimed at halting the spread of weapons of mass destruction. An unidentified North Korean military spokesman said South Korea’s full participation in the plan, the Proliferation Security Initiative, would be seen “as a declaration of undisguised confrontation and a declaration of a war” against North Korea. South Korea’s Unification Ministry expressed regret  over the North’s threats and said joining the program would not be a “declaration of confrontation or war.”

Land next to the DMZ may fetch only $9,200 per acre — cheap by the standards of South Korea — but it could not even be given away a few years ago, real estate agents say.

YIGIL,South Korea— “There are now three people who are interested in buying this land,” said Lee Heung-bok, a real estate agent, standing atop a hill and waving with his left hand at some 57 acres of pristine river and green mountains inhabited by wild black boars. “One person is interested in building a golf course,” he added. “Not right now, of course, but sometime in the future.” “A golf course will take more than 10 years,” said the potential buyer, Park Jae-yong, standing next to Mr. Lee and holding a newspaper over his head against the midday sun’s glare. “Right now, even if we build a golf course, nobody would be able to come in here anyway.” Yigil is a farming village by the demilitarized zone dividing South Korea fromNorth Korea. It lies inside what is called the Civilian Control Zone, an area extending some 10 miles south of the DMZ and restricted to residents and soldiers. Others must get passes to enter the zone, where the military has restricted construction to low-lying buildings. Barricades flank the zone’s main roads, built in such a way that they can be made to collapse and slow down invading North Korean tanks. Hanging on barbed wire alongside many forested areas are red-and-orange triangular signs warning about land mines. Yigil lies so close to North Korea that a tunnel leading from the North to the South, dug by North Korean soldiers, was discovered nearby in 1975. Despite all that, warming ties between South and North Korea have been drawing speculators like Mr. Park to Yigil and other villages here in the middle of the peninsula. In the last three years, prices have risen so much that agents and locals here say even areas with land mines have doubled or tripled in value. Land next to the DMZ may fetch only $9,200 per acre — cheap by the standards of South Korea’s real estate bubble — but it could not even be given away a few years ago, real estate agents say. Prices may rise further after the summit meeting between leaders of the two Koreas. Interest in land just south of the DMZ increased after the first such meeting in 2000, as the threat of war diminished and South Korea adopted a policy of engaging the North economically and politically. Agents and officials here say that buyers considering land for country houses or other developments are looking outside the Civilian Control Zone. Land inside the zone, where building is still restricted by the military, is drawing speculators. “Some have bought land-mined areas for a cheap price, de-mined them and resold them for a profit,” said Kim Young-sun, a real estate specialist at Chorwon County, which includes Yigil as well as other villages in and outside the zone. Mr. Lee, the real estate agent, said some speculators were also buying land inside the 2.5-mile-wide DMZ itself, paying the equivalent of $1,300 an acre to the title holders. “It’s so cheap,” Mr. Lee said. “But it’s a recent phenomenon. There is the expectation that one day there will be reunification.” The site of one of the Korean War’s fiercest battles, much of Chorwon was a no man’s land  until the government sent 150 war veterans here in 1967, telling them that if they de-mined the land, they could keep some of it. “We just did the work with shovels,” said Yoo Chul-hoon, 70, one of the original 150 and a resident of Daema, a village a few miles west of here. “Many people were maimed by the land mines,” said Mr. Yoo, who lost part of his right leg while clearing a mine. “At one point, we were burying two people a day.” Many of the prewar owners eventually returned to villages in and outside the zone and reclaimed their land. But the cold war kept development away and land prices down. Although the two Koreas remain officially at war, the 2000 summit meeting fundamentally changed the South’s perception of the North from cold war enemy to an estranged relative who needed to be coaxed into behaving well. The North Korean nuclear crisis, though still unresolved, has not shaken that perception, or reined in rising land prices just south of the DMZ. “The proximity to North Korea was in fact a positive factor,” said Rheu Jee-seuk, 50, a resident of Seoul who bought a 15-acre plot just outside the Civilian Control Zone last year. “The nature is untouched here, and there’s almost no development because the area’s so close to North Korea.” He added, “A threat from North Korea is not an issue.” Mr. Rheu has started building a country home on his land and now grows cabbage and other vegetables there. With relations with the North improving, the South has loosened restrictions inside the Civilian Control Zone, a mostly agricultural area. The zone’s southern border has been brought closer to the DMZ, effectively shrinking the zone; local officials and residents are pressing Seoul to make it even smaller so that they can develop businesses in the freed-up space. On the hill here overlooking the 57-acre land up for sale, Mr. Park, the potential buyer, said he owned land north of Seoul but was not “familiar with this place.” “I heard there might be good land here,” said Mr. Park, 77, who said he owned a fertilizer company. Asked whether he was nervous about possibly buying land — at 21 cents per square foot, or double its  price five years ago — just two miles south of the DMZ, Mr. Park waved his hand. “Even if we don’t reunify, as long as we can have traffic between the two Koreas, it will be all right,” he said. He dismissed the idea of building a golf course here. “Maybe an inn, then?” said Mr. Lee, the real estate agent. “Yes,” Mr. Park said, looking up and squinting into the sun’s glare, “that’s a little more realistic.”

NORTH KOREA-SOUTH KOREABORDER, Tuesday, Oct. 2 (Reuters) — South Korea’s president stepped across the heavily armed border with the North on Tuesday to start a summit meeting aimed at ending a half-century of animosity. Critics say PresidentRoh Moo-hyun’s meeting with the North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, in Pyongyang is symbolic at best, prompted by domestic political concerns, and will skirt the North’s nuclear arms program and its widely criticized human rights record. Mr. Roh, who faces an  election in December and trails badly in the polls, has said he will press for peace and an eventual arms cut for the states, technically still at war, and may pledge billions of dollars in aid for the North’s troubled economy. Mr. Roh stopped his limousine just south of the border. He walked across a 31-inch yellow strip laid out on the border with the words “peace and prosperity” written on it, becoming the first South Korean president to walk into the reclusive North. He was greeted by North Koreans on the other side and handed flowers by women in traditional dress before getting back into his car and heading to Pyongyang. In the countries’ first summit meeting, in June 2000, the South Korean president at the time, Kim Dae-jung, flew to Pyongyang, where he was greeted by a beaming Kim Jong-il. That meeting led to an easing of tensions, but expectations are lower now because of a vague agenda and skepticism about whether Mr. Roh will be able to accomplish much.

North Korea today flatly rejected international demands that it abandon its nuclear weapons program. The statement came at the opening session of talks with Japan aimed at establishing normal relations between the two countries. The rejection, reflected in opening remarks and repeated during the first day of talks, followed consultations in Mexico that ended two days ago, in which the United States, South Korea and Japan urged the North to end its bomb program.

BEIJING —North Korea’s leader,Kim Jong-il, has leftChinaafter completing a secretive five-day visit that included a meeting on Friday with China’s president,Hu Jintao, state news agencies in both nations reported Monday evening. China’s state-run Xinhua news agencysaid Mr. Kim expressed hopeduring the meeting that six-party talks would resume over dismantlingNorth Korea’s nuclear weaponsprogram and easing tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The reports from both countries’ news outlets came shortly after reporters staking out the China-North Korea border saw a special train carrying Mr. Kim cross the border at Tumen, a Chinese town near the northeastern tip of North Korea, on Monday evening. They provided few other details of the visit. The timing of the visit also confirmed that Mr. Kim was absent from the country during a visit last week by the former President Jimmy Carter, who flew to North Korea and successfully helped free an American who had been sentenced for illegally entering the reclusive country. But a roster of the North Korean delegation released by that nation’s Pyongyang Broadcasting Station notably did not include Mr. Kim’s third son, Kim Jong-un, who is rumored to be Mr. Kim’s chosen successor, South Korean news agencies reported. Much of the news coverage on Mr. Kim’s visit has focused on whether he introduced his son to Chinese leaders during his trip. But South Korea’s Herald newspaper, citing the broadcast, said that the delegation instead included North’s Korea’s foreign and defense ministers and top officials of the ruling Workers’ Party. However, the North’s state-run news agency, K.C.N.A., also reported that Mr. Kim alluded to the succession during his meeting with Mr. Hu. “In the complex international situation, it is our historic mission to ensure that the baton of friendship between Korea and China is smoothly handed over to the next generation,” Mr. Kim told Mr. Hu during a party, according to the agency. The report did not clarify whether Mr. Kim mentioned his son when he made the comment. Both leaders agreed to deepen their ties, K.C.N.A. reported. The reports said that Mr. Kim and Mr. Hu had met in Changchun, the capital of northeastern China’s Jilin Province, and that Mr. Kim had visited two other northern Chinese cities, Jilin City and Harbin. According to Xinhua, Mr. Kim and Mr. Hu “exchanged views on the situation of the Korean Peninsula and other international and regional issues of concern.” Mr. Hu was reported to have said that “some new developments” had occurred in the Korean situation in recent months, but the report was not specific. The six-party negotiations on the North’s nuclear program have proceeded in fits and starts since 2003 but have been in limbo since May 2009, when North Korea walked out, restarted its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon and conducted its second nuclear-weapon test. Mr. Kim has insisted that North Korea wants a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula, but many outside analysts believe he is committed to keeping the country’s weapons program.

Perhaps it was too chilly for the beautiful game; Brazil ground out a workmanlike victory against lightly regarded North Korea.

JOHANNESBURG — On a frigid night with the temperature just above freezing, Brazil finally melted North Korea’s defense for a 2-1 victory on Tuesday, but the five-time champions never fully thawed out in their World Cup opener. In a scoreless first half, Brazil seemed alternately nervous, indolent and impatient against North Korea’s compact and organized defense that frequently strung five players across the back line. “I believe this first match is always very trying,” Dunga, Brazil’s coach, said. “There is a lot of nervousness, a lot of anxiety. I’m not entirely happy, but this is very common.” Finally, in the 55th minute, right back Maicon scored from an acute angle. Midfielder Elano followed in the 72nd minute to provide a win that was dominant, but more businesslike than inspired. North Korea scored in the 89th minute, gaining some consolation in its first appearance in the World Cup since stunning Italy in 1966 and maintaining hope that it can still advance from a group that also includes Portugal and the Ivory Coast. Brazil’s aim, of course, is much higher. Nothing short of a sixth World Cup title will satisfy. There is plenty of time to round into form, but time is growing urgent for Kaka, its biggest star, who provided only glimpses of the indomitable playmaker who was named the world player of the year in 2007. Kaká missed six weeks at Real Madrid this past season with groin and thigh injuries. He has said that the injuries are healed and that he would be in top condition by the World Cup opener. Clearly, he was not. His early passes were sloppy. Several times, he was stripped of the ball. He remained on the periphery before leaving for a substitute in the 78th minute. “I’m sure every game he will improve,” his teammate Gilberto Silva said. “It was very good to see him because he is really hungry to do well. He’s got the confidence of everyone.” Meanwhile, Kaká’s playmaking duties often fell to striker Robinho, whose magnificent diagonal pass in the 72nd minute found Elano in stride in the penalty area for a 2-0 lead and what became the winning goal. After a falling out at Manchester City in the English Premier League, where he played sparingly, the sometimes tempestuous Robinho returned to Santos in Brazil in January and recovered the form that will make him indispensable in the World Cup with his vision and creativity. In the fallow first half Tuesday, it was Robinho who most imaginatively tried to penetrate North Korea’s defense with his cunning step-over moves and a quick spin maneuver that forced a save on a hard rolling shot. “A year ago, nobody wanted him,” Dunga said. “I wanted him for the national team. I’m extremely happy with him.” In the 55th minute, Elano slid a pass to the surging Maicon on the right flank, assisting on a shot that is more often found in billiards than in soccer. Near the end line, Maicon struck the ball with the outside of his right foot and it swerved around the near goal post into the net, surprising the North Korean goalkeeper Ri Myong-guk, who expected a crossing pass. While many players, especially goalkeepers, have criticized the official World Cup ball made by Adidas, saying it flies erratically and unpredictably, Maicon’s aim was true from what seemed an impossible angle. “The ball is very favorable to us,” Maicon said. “I must say, it’s fantastic. It’s difficult for goalkeepers, though. That’s the truth.” Maicon is considered the best right back in the game. All night Tuesday, he streaked forward in attack, propelling Brazil with his thunderous right foot the way he had Inter Milan as it won the European Champions League title. Born in 1981 with a twin brother, Maicon was named Maicon Douglas Sisenado after the actor Michael Douglas. His mother, he told reporters recently, “found him really sexy.” According to Agence France-Presse, Maicon’s father, a retired soccer player, took the umbilical cords of his twin sons and buried them beneath the field of his former Brazilian club team, Novo Hamburgo, intending early on for his boys to follow a similar career path. Even Maicon’s persistent runs, though, could not produce a goal before halftime Tuesday. North Korea played the Brazilians evenly and about 100 of its fans cheered in a regimented fashion, wearing identical red jackets, hats and soccer scarves. Some banged wooden clappers. One thousand Chinese fans had been recruited for the tournament as surrogate North Korean cheerleaders, including actors and musicians, according to Xinhua, China’s state-run news agency. But these fans identified themselves as Korean, saying they had been handpicked by the North Korean government and did not know each other until arriving here Tuesday. “We thought we should have scored two goals by now,” one of the fans, Kim Yong-chong, said at intermission. North Korea finally got a goal in the 89th minute by defender Ji Yun-nam, but the game was in Brazil’s hands. No doubt that goal will be shown at some point at home on state-run television, which has secured the rights to World Cup telecasts from the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union. South Korea had declined to provide free television coverage to North Korea, given increasingly tense relations between the two countries. South Korea has blamed the North for sinking one of its warships in March, killing 46 sailors. North Korea did show a delayed and edited broadcast of South Korea’s opening victory over Greece, however. “We are all one Korea,” Kim, the fan, said Tuesday. But Kim Jong-hun, North Korea’s coach, answered frostily when asked if he were following South Korea’s team. “Since we have two important matches left, I have a lot to think about for my own matches,” he said.

NORTH KOREA Another Country By Bruce Cumings 241 pages. New Press. $24.95. Communism collapsed. Well, not exactly. Not in Cuba and not across Asia. It did give way in Mongolia and Afghanistan, both Soviet satellites, but indigenous Communist regimes persist in China, Vietnam and North Korea. In the American imagination though, Pyongyang stands apart. Kim Jong Il's neighbors cannot ignore his saber-rattling and refugees, but Japan, China, Russia and especially South Korea have not seemed overly panicked. So what's the fuss in the United States? Could North Korea's alleged nukes and misfiring missiles really menace the American homeland? As for Pyongyang's possible proliferation, why not help reinvigorate the International Atomic Energy Agency? Must the United States police the planet? And must all countries come to resemble the American system? Why not let those in the neighborhood confront or engage the addled workers' paradise? North Korea, insists Bruce Cumings, is indeed an American concern -- a stance he shares with his bête noire, axis-of-evil antagonists. But whereas hawks urge a toppling, he writes of the North Koreans that ''it is their country, for better or worse -- another country.'' And yet, he contends in six timely essays (some familiar from his many expert books), the United States contributed mightily to the North Korean predicament and Americans should acknowledge this forgotten responsibility and negotiate a permanent peace. A benevolent hegemon? Such paradoxes twist the book into a double helix of top scholarship and over-the-top commentary. In some of this compact volume's most effective passages, Mr. Cumings quotes prominent American journalists on the showdown with North Korea -- C.I.A. estimates of one or two bombs, doomsday alarms to act now -- before he reveals that the quotations come from 1991-94. Today's hullabaloo is a rerun. He counters the hype with an instructive history. One chapter documents the roots of the North Korean revolution in the 1930's anti-Japanese guerrilla war in Manchuria, which more than Soviet tanks brought Kim Il Sung and his cohort to power. Another examines the dynastic succession of his son, Kim Jong Il, who works at home in his pajamas, like an information economy habitué, but in public sports polyester leisure suits, pointy-toed elevator shoes and oversize sunglasses of malevolent tint, like a throwback idol. Meanwhile, his illegitimate son craves a Ferrari and his adopted daughter scorns Communism's tedium for Switzerland's high life -- hints of elite defection. These insights are served up with liberal doses of anti-American-imperialism castor oil and North Korean sugar tablets. ''On my infrequent visits to the country,'' Mr. Cumings writes, ''I have been happy,'' adding that ''empathy for the underdog is something I can't help, being a life-long fan of the Cleveland Indians.'' Penal colonies hold 100,000 to 150,000 people, over half of them political prisoners, Mr. Cumings reports. But he deems the gulag both smaller than usually asserted and survivable, partly because detainees' families are incarcerated with them. Free adults face military induction for eight-year terms, the first six without home leave. It's a garrison state (7 million of its 23 million people are in the army or reserves), but he points out that conscripts labor in construction or agricultural brigades. A multiyear famine continues to starve and kill. What holds it together? Politically, North Korea ''is not a nice place, but it is an understandable place,'' Mr. Cumings writes, ''an anticolonial and anti-imperial state growing out of a half century of Japanese colonial rule and another half century of continuous confrontation with a hegemonic United States and a more powerful South Korea.'' In other words, the country's staying power as well as its ''deformations'' (the author's euphemism) supposedly emanate not from Communist ideology and censorship but from its historical crucible, especially the holocaust, as he puts it, that the North underwent during the Korean War. In 1950 ''Koreans invaded Korea,'' Mr. Cumings writes. ''What do we make of that?'' What he makes of it is that in 1945, by designating the 38th parallel to demarcate American and Soviet occupation zones, the United States was inviting a war. Thus, he suggests that it was not Kim Il Sung or Stalin who incited hostilities but Dean Acheson and Harry S. Truman. Still, he comes close to endorsing the 1951 ejection of the invading North from South Korea by arguing that the proper response was not a bloody rollback to the Chinese border but a job-done halt at the 38th parallel, which is where matters wound up in 1953 anyway. In the interim, he writes, the United States blanketed civilians with napalm. Three million North Koreans, one million South Koreans, nearly one million Chinese and around 50,000 Americans died. ''This was Korea, 'the limited war,' '' Mr. Cumings writes with fury. American-led forces moonscaped industrial Northern and Central Korea, leaving snowy emptiness and a determined nation that survived in caves. Mr. Cumings damns the Bush administration -- ''the greater evil'' -- for refusing the pleas of this ''shrewd'' despotic regime to lift it out of its post-Soviet soup and protect it from being swallowed up by the South. He salutes South Korea's Sunshine Policy because like détente it embraces coexistence and evolutionary change. Yet of the reforms under way in North Korea, Mr. Cumings skeptically points out that the bureaucracy divides into incommunicative fiefs while the dominant military reveres and profits from the status quo. Perhaps the biggest obstacle is the pride of elites stuck on the memory of how, until the 1970's, the North outperformed the South. Trapped in a time warp, the system awaits an inescapable generational change. Timeworn predictions of collapse and verbal threats of regime change notwithstanding, North Korea endures. One native Communism, Cambodia's Khmer Rouge, was overthrown from without by Communist Vietnam. Homegrown revolutions were cashiered from within in the two ethnoterritorial federations, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, the latter cataclysmically. Even where Communism cracked itself up, however, it left behind gigantic shards, like obsolete factories and the K.G.B. China's managed changeover is already a quarter century old. The end of Communism is a protracted process.

TOKYO — Secretary of StateHillary Rodham Clinton, in her first full day on a weeklong tour of Asia, warnedNorth Koreaon Tuesday not to undertake a test of a long-range missile, as it has threatened. “The possible missile launch that North Korea is talking about would be very unhelpful in moving our relationship forward,” Mrs. Clinton said after a meeting with the Japanese foreign minister, Hirofumi Nakasone. North Korea’s saber rattling has cast a shadow over Mrs. Clinton’s inaugural foreign trip, as has Japan’s deteriorating economy, which was reflected Monday when     the government reported the country’s deepest quarterly economic contraction since 1974. Mrs. Clinton reaffirmed the importance of the alliance between Japan and the United States, bringing an invitation from President Obama to Prime Minister Taro Aso to meet him at the White House next Tuesday. He will be the first foreign leader received at the White House. In Mrs. Clinton’s first bit of diplomatic business, the United States and Japan signed an agreement Tuesday to begin shifting thousands of marines from Okinawa to Guam, part of a realignment of troops in the Pacific. Later on Tuesday she was to meet with families of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea in the 1970s and 1980s. Mr. Nakasone said her meeting underscored American support for the abductees,  an issue that stirs deep animosity toward North Korea in Japan. As she arrived in Japan on Monday, North Korea issued an oblique statement responding to  news reports that it was  preparing to test-launch a Taepodong-2 missile from a base on its east coast. “One will come to know later what will be launched,” the North’s state-run news agency, KCNA, said. In Seoul, the South Korean defense minister, Lee Sang-hee, said North Korea had been preparing to test a Taepodong-2 missile since January.

American intelligence officials have concluded that Pakistan, a vital ally since last year's terrorist attacks, was a major supplier of critical equipment for North Korea's newly revealed clandestine nuclear weapons program, current and former senior American officials said today. The equipment, which may include gas centrifuges used to create weapons-grade uranium, appears to have been part of a barter deal beginning in the late 1990's in which North Korea supplied Pakistan with missiles it could use to counter India's nuclear arsenal, the officials said.

The Bush administration responded today to the disclosure of North Korea's nuclear weapons program with a strategy of urgent diplomatic pressure free of military threats or even a tone of crisis. It was a marked contrast with the drumbeat of warnings about force and the mobilization of troops against Iraq, also a member of the ''axis of evil'' identified by President Bush, but one he says poses the most serious danger to the United States. The two separate and in some respects contradictory strategies reflected the administration's desire not to let North Korea derail Washington's plans to confront Saddam Hussein. The risk was that some Americans might wonder why conciliation ought not to be tried toward both countries.

Reacting to President Bush's charge in his State of the Union address that it was part of an ''axis of evil,'' North Korea today backed away from an initiative it had quietly begun for opening a dialogue with influential American experts. In recent months, North Korea had encouraged a visit by former American ambassadors to South Korea. The move was widely seen as North Korea's way to keep up its channels of communication with the United States despite its frosty relationship with the Bush administration.

The South Korean president will travel to China to seek its support if the South calls for sanctions against the North, but Beijing is unlikely to give it.

SEOUL, South Korea — On Friday, President Lee Myung-bak will travel toChinaunder growing pressure at home to make the case for crucial Chinese support for tough international sanctions againstNorth Koreaif, as is widely expected, the North isfound responsible for the sinkingof a South Korean ship. But he is unlikely to win that support, experts say, a reflection of China’s growing role in the Korean Peninsula. Since taking office in 2008, Mr. Lee has wound down his predecessors’ “sunshine policy” of aid and engagement with the North, heightening Chinese fears of instability and driving the North into China’s economic embrace. Ultimately, that could give Beijing greater leverage in determining the fate of the northern half of the Korean Peninsula, a situation that many South Koreans would consider to be a nightmare. “China’s influence has become so important that we can almost say that it can now claim the first and last piece of the apple on the Korean Peninsula,” said Lee Byong-chul, a senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul, using a Korean saying to suggest that China can have whatever it wants. Even conservatives, who have usually opposed aid to the North, warn of North Korea’s becoming a “Chinese colony” whenever reports circulate of Chinese companies taking over North Korean ports and mines at bargain prices. Those fears are undoubtedly overblown, but they contain a kernel of truth, experts say. South Korea’s concern “about China’s rising dominance over North Korea in economic terms is well founded,” said John Delury, associate director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at theAsia Societyin New York. “However, I think it’s the result of Lee Myung-bak’s decision to let the sunshine policy unravel, rather than a strategic plot by China to ‘colonize’ North Korea economically.” China, which supplies an estimated 70 percent of North Korea’s trade, is the one country that can provide the necessary economic pressure to push the isolated North to the brink of collapse — or, as Washington, Seoul and Tokyo hope, press it to agree to concessions over itsnuclear weaponsprogram. But Beijing is always going to be wary of stronger sanctions. It fears an implosion in North Korea that could release a flood of refugees across its border or put it under pressure to intervene militarily should South Korea and the United States move into the North to seize its nuclear arsenal and build a Western-leaning, unified Korea on China’s border. Its paramount concern regarding North Korea is to preserve stability, more than to punish it for truculent behavior or persuade it to give up its nuclear weapons. “China is more interested in maintaining the status quo and avoiding instability, and believes that more trade will help to keep things from falling apart in North Korea,” said David Straub, a North Korea specialist at theShorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Centerat Stanford who was formerly a senior State Department official who specialized in Northeast Asian affairs. China juggles its diplomacy between North Korea and its adversaries, just as North Korea plays the regional powers against one another to secure a lifeline that sustains it and allows it to avoid political changes while maintaining its nuclear programs. In the past, sanctions have brought only mixed results against the North; as often as not, they have stiffened its defiance. Jin Jingyi, a Chinese specialist on Korean affairs atPeking University, said that the sinking of the South Korean ship had highlighted the weakness of Mr. Lee’s position. “The fact that South Korea keeps talking about international cooperation with China and others shows that Lee Myung-bak has lost the initiative in inter-Korean relations,” Mr. Jin said. “China will be very cautious,” he continued. “It won’t think pressuring the North will help solve the problem.” China, which seeks to enhance stability and reduce economic risk in the region, would like to see better inter-Korean relations, experts say, but just the opposite has happened under Mr. Lee. “China would probably rather share the burden of economic engagement with the South, but if necessary, it will hold its ground as North Korea’s sole economic outlet,” said Mr. Delury of the Asia Society. “The resource-hungry, stability-centric, sanctions-averse Chinese will continue filling the void left by the dismantling of inter-Korean cooperation.” In South Korea, people remain deeply suspicious and fearful of China, which sided with the North during the Korean War. Officially, the goal of both North and South Korea is the reunification of the peninsula, but that is currently unlikely. North Korea loathes the American military presence in the South, just as South Koreans bristle at Chinese influence in the North. China, for its part, knows that the Koreans historically have never been pliant neighbors and that North Korea is an unreliable place to invest, as demonstrated by the North’s heavy-handed threats toconfiscate South Korean investors’ assetsat its Diamond Mountain resort and Kaesong. China reportedly has complained to the North about its aid trains “disappearing” inside the North, apparently stolen and torn apart. “Despite their public rhetoric about the closeness of their ties, officials in both China and North Korea each tell even American officials how much they dislike the other,” said Mr. Straub, the North Korea specialist at Stanford. “North Korean officials have on numerous occasions suggested to American officials that it would be in the interests of our two countries to have a strategic relationship — to counter China.”

The South Korean government invited North Korea to resume ministerial talks, while Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan came under attack for his government’s refusal to provide assistance to the North.

TOKYO, Feb. 14 — The deal to freezeNorth Korea’s nuclear program has had immediate ripple effects inJapanandSouth Korea, apparently freeing South Korea’s hands and tying Japan’s. A day after the accord was brokered, requiring the North to shut its main nuclear reactor in return for food and fuel assistance, the South Korean government invited North Korea to resume ministerial talks suspended after its nuclear test last October. Seoul announced that officials from both sides had agreed to meet Thursday in Kaesong, just north of the demilitarized zone. “What is very important about the agreement is that it not only resolves the North Korea nuclear issue itself,” South Korea’s president,Roh Moo-hyun, said, “but, in a further step, it includes a clause for discussions, negotiations on establishing a permanent peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.” But in Tokyo, Prime MinisterShinzo Abecame under attack from members of the opposition and his own party for his government’s refusal to provide assistance to the North over what it says are unresolved cases of Japanese abducted by North Korean agents. Critics said Tokyo’s narrow focus on this issue, seemingly at the expense of regional stability, would leave it isolated. “We must not be isolated and we are not in fact isolated,” Mr. Abe said in Parliament. “Other countries understood our decision not to provide oil unless progress is made in the abduction issue.” South Korea, by contrast, appeared set to resume its economic and diplomatic engagement of the North, a policy that had long strained its relations with the Bush administration. “It will be easier for President Roh to carry out his engagement policy now, maybe even further than he ever had,” said Shin Jung-wha, a political scientist at Dongseo University in Pusan, South Korea. The deal also made it more unlikely that South Korea would alter its policy even if the conservative opposition were to win in next December’s presidential election. “Many Koreans feel that President Roh has been too lenient on North Korea,” Ms. Shin said. “But there is a national consensus on the engagement policy, and, if the conservatives gain power next December, there might be a few tweaks but no fundamental change in the policy.” In Japan’s case, Mr. Abe’s government tied the nuclear talks to the cases of Japanese abducted by the North in the 1970s. The North has acknowledged kidnapping a dozen Japanese and it returned five survivors four years ago, saying the rest had died. But Japan says more survivors remain in the North. Mr. Abe made his political career by championing the abduction issue, which critics say he has exploited to stir nationalist sentiments. Analysts say it would be difficult for Mr. Abe, whose approval ratings have plummeted after a series of scandals and gaffes, to compromise on the issue. At the same time, refusing to assist North Korea in keeping with the accord could lead to charges that Japan was putting regional stability at risk over a domestic issue that has little resonance outside Japan. “Japan should be conducting diplomacy with a broader perspective,” said Makoto Taniguchi, president of Iwate Prefectural University in Japan and a former senior diplomat. “It should be thinking of Asian security and peace. If Japan thinks narrowly, only of its relations with the United States at the expense of its relations with its neighbors, it will find itself excluded. “Japanese diplomacy has, so to speak, been abducted by the abduction issue,” Mr. Taniguchi added. The Japanese government said it hoped to address the abduction issue in a working group established under the accord and aimed at normalizing relations between Japan and North Korea. Tokyo has said it would not normalize relations with the North and provide it with reparations for its colonial rule unless the abducted Japanese were accounted for. But Japan’s emphasis on the abductions in the working group is likely to bring forth a long list of historical grievances on North Korea’s part. A North Korean Foreign Ministry official, Ri Pyong-dok, told the Kyodo news agency in Japan that the North’s focus in the working group would be on Japan’s colonial rule. “The settlement of crimes committed by Japan is a priority,” Mr. Ri said. “Without that, there will be no normalization of relations between the two countries.”

At first glance the most important fact about the new agreement concluded between Red China and North Korea seems to be that impoverished China has agreed to contribute $317,000,000 -- even more than the $250,000,000 Russia has promised -- to help rehabilitate the Communist portion of Korea.

Interviews with eight people who recently left North Korea paint a haunting portrait of desperation and political resentment.

YANJI, China — Like many North Koreans, the  construction worker lived in penury. His state employer had not paid him for so long that he had forgotten his salary. Indeed, he paid his boss to be listed as a dummy worker so that he could leave his work site. Then he and his wife could scrape out a living selling small bags of detergent on the black market. It hardly seemed that life could get worse. And then, one Saturday afternoon last November, his sister burst into his apartment in Chongjin with shocking news: the North Korean government had decided to drastically devalue the nation’s currency. The family’s life savings, about $1,560, had been reduced to about $30. Last month the construction worker sat in a safe house in this bustling northern Chinese city, lamenting years of useless sacrifice. Vegetables for his parents, his wife’s asthma medicine, the navy track suit his 15-year-old daughter craved — all were forsworn on the theory that, even inNorth Korea, the future was worth saving for. “Ai!” he exclaimed, cursing between sobs. “How we worked to save that money! Thinking about it makes me go crazy.” North Koreans are used to struggle and heartbreak. But the Nov. 30currency devaluation, apparently an attempt to prop up a foundering state-run economy, was for some the worst disaster since a famine  that killed hundreds of thousands in the mid-1990s. Interviews in the past month with eight North Koreans who recently left their country — a prison escapee, illegal traders, people in temporary exile to find work inChina, the traveling wife of an official in the ruling Workers’ Party — paint a haunting portrait of desperation inside North Korea, a nation of 24 million people, and of growing resentment toward its erratic leader,Kim Jong-il. What seems missing — for now, at least — is social instability. Widespread hardship, popular anger over the currency revaluation and growing political uncertainty as Mr. Kim seeks to install his third son as his successor have not hardened into noticeable resistance against the government. At least two of those interviewed in China hewed to the official propaganda line that North Korea was a victim of die-hard enemies, its impoverishment a Western plot, its survival threatened by the United States,South Koreaand Japan. South Korea’s charge that North Korea sank one of its warships, the Cheonan, in March was just part of the plot, the party official’s wife said. “That’s why we have weapons to protect ourselves,” she said while visiting relatives in northern China — and earning spare cash as a waitress. “Our enemies are trying to hit us from all sides, and that’s why we lack electricity and good infrastructure. North Korea must keep its doors locked.” Others were more skeptical of the government’s propaganda, but still cast war as an inevitability. “We always wait for the invasion,” said one former primary school teacher. “My son says he wishes the war would come because life is too hard, and we will probably die anyway from starvation.” They and other North Koreans spoke only on the condition that they could withhold their names in discussions largely arranged by underground churches operating in China just across the border. If they were identified as traveling or working in China illegally, they could be deported and imprisoned, along with their relatives. About half of those interviewed said they planned to return to North Korea; the other half hoped to defect to South Korea. On many details, their accounts, given separately, dovetailed. They also reinforced descriptions by economists and political analysts of a stricken nation. A Reeling Economy Citing aerial photos of plumeless smokestacks, economists say roughly three of every four North Korean factories are idle. The economy has been staggering badly since 2006, when Kim Jong-il pulled out of multinational talks aimed at ending his nuclear weapons program. The sinking of the Cheonan will further damage the economy: South Korea has suspended nearly all trade, depriving the North of $333 million a year from seafood sales and other exports. When the Korean Peninsula was divided in 1945, South Korea was poorer than its neighbor. Now its average worker earns 15 times as much as an average North Korean, according to cost-of-living-adjusted data. The number of defectors who make it through China to South Korea has steadily risen for a decade, hitting nearly 3,000 last year. Infant and maternal mortality rates jumped at least 30 percent from 1993 to 2008, and life expectancy fell by three years to 69 during the same period, according to North Korean census figures and the United Nations Population Fund. TheUnited Nations World Food Programsays one in three North Korean children under the age of 5 are malnourished. More than one in four people needfood aid, the agency says, but only about one in 17 will get it this year, partly because donors are reluctant to send aid to a country that has insisted on developing nuclear weapons. The currency devaluation has only heightened the suffering. Its aim was to divert the proceeds of North Korea’s vast entrepreneurial underground — its street markets — to its cash-starved government businesses. The markets are the sole source of income for many North Koreans, but they flout the government’s credo of economic socialism. Theoretically, everyone except minors, the elderly and mothers with young children works for the state. But state enterprises have been withering for 30 years, and North Koreans do all they can to escape work in them. Farmers tend their own gardens as weeds overtake collective farms. Urban workers duck state assignments to peddle everything from metal scavenged from mothballed factories to televisions smuggled from China. “If you don’t trade, you die,” said the former teacher, a round-faced 51-year-old woman with a ponytail. She went from obedient state employee to lawbreaking trader, but could not escape her plight. Too Hungry to Study She taught primary school for 30 years in Chongjin, North Korea’s third-largest city, with roughly 500,000 people. What once was an all-day job shrank by 2004 to morning duty; schools closed at noon. At least 15 of her 50 students dropped out or left after an hour, too hungry to study. “It is very hard to teach a starving child,” she said. “Even sitting at a desk is difficult for them.” Teachers were hungry, too. Her monthly salary scarcely bought two pounds of rice, she said. A university graduate, she pulled her own child out of the third grade in 1998, instead sending her to a neighbor to learn to sew. She quit in 2004 to sell corn noodles outside Chongjin’s main market, an expanse of stalls and plastic tarpaulins half the size of a city block where traders mainly sell Chinese goods, including toothpaste, sewing needles and DVDs of banned South Korean soap operas. But noodles were barely profitable, so she tried a riskier trade in state-controlled commodities: pine nuts and red berries used in a popular tea. That scheme collapsed in October. After she and her partners collected 17 sacks of goods from a village, a guard at a checkpoint confiscated them all instead of taking a bribe to let them pass. She was left with $300 in debt. Like her, the construction worker, a rail-thin 45-year-old with a head for numbers, figured that private enterprise was his family’s only salvation. But as a man, it was harder for him to shake off his work assignment. On paper, he said, a Chongjin state construction company employs him. But the company has few supplies and no cash to pay its employees. So like more than a third of the workers, the worker said, he pays roughly $5 a month to sign in as an employee on the company’s daily log — and then toil elsewhere. Such payments, widespread at smaller state companies, are supposed to keep companies solvent, said one 62-year-old woman who is a trader in Chongjin. Even a major enterprise like the city’s metal refinery has not paid salaries since 2007, she and others said, though workers there collect 10 days worth of food rations each month. “How would the companies survive if they didn’t get money from the workers?” she asked without irony. Recently, the construction worker’s firm has been more active. The state has resurfaced Chongjin’s only paved road and built a hospital and a university for the 2012 centennial of the birth of Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il’s father and North Korea’s founder. But the burst of projects bore a cost: each family was required to deliver 17 bags of pebbles every month to its local party committee. The construction worker enlisted his elderly parents to scour creek beds and fields for rocks that the family smashed by hand into grape-size stones. With no state salary, he earns money by his wits. Every October, he sells squid caught from a boat he pilots in treacherous coastal waters. In other months, he bicycles about 20 miles every day looking for goods to sell, typically detergent bought from a factory that is resold by his wife at a 12 percent markup on a purple tarpaulin outside the main market. The government periodically tries to rein in the markets, regulating prices, hours, types of goods sold, the sellers’ age and sex and even whether they haul their wares on bicycles or their backs. Savings Wiped Out In one 2007 Central Committee communiqué, Kim Jong-il complained that the markets had become “a birthplace of all sorts of nonsocialist practices.” The Nov. 30 currency devaluation upended them. The state decreed that a new, more valuable won would replace the old won, but that families could trade only 100,000 won, about $30 at the black market rate, for the new one. The move effectively wiped out private stores of money. To cushion the blow, workers say, they were promised that their salaries would be restored if they returned to their government jobs. In fact, the construction worker and others say, they got one month’s pay, in January, before salaries again disappeared. Some with political connections skirted the worst. One woman from Hamhung, North Korea’s second-largest city, said the local bank director allowed her relatives to exchange three million won, 30 times the official limit. The party official’s wife, hair softly curled, a knock-off designer purse by her side, boasted about her six-room house with two color televisions and a garden. In the next breath, she praised devaluation as well-deserved punishment of those who had cheated the state, even though she acknowledged that it led to chaos and noted that a top finance official was executed for mismanaging the policy. “A lot of bad people had gotten rich doing illegal trading with China, while the good people at the state companies didn’t have enough money,” she said. “So the haves gave to the have-nots.” The former teacher gave all she had. After her creditors stripped her of all her money, she said, she walked across the frozen Tumen River at night and into China to seek help from her relatives there. Famished and terrified, she said she banged randomly on doors until a stranger helped her contact them. Now safe in her relatives’ home, she said, she marvels over how they enjoy delicacies like cucumbers in winter. But temporarily deserting her son and daughter, both in their mid-20s, has left her so guilt-ridden that she sometimes cannot swallow the food set in front of her. “I don’t know whether my children have managed to get some money, or whether they have starved to death,” she said, her eyes brimming with tears. For the construction worker, his sister’s news of the coming devaluation unleashed a furious scramble to salvage the family nest egg. He emptied the living-room cabinet drawer that held their savings and split it with his wife and daughter, telling them, “Buy whatever you can, as fast as you can.” The three bicycled furiously to Chongjin’s market. “It was like a battlefield,” he said. Thousands of people frantically tried to outbid one another to convert soon-to-be worthless money into something tangible. Some prices rose 10,000 percent, he said, before traders shut down, realizing that their profits soon would be worthless, too. The three said they returned home with 66 pounds of rice, a pig’s head and 220 pounds of bean curd. The construction worker’s daughter had managed to purchase a small cutting board and a used pair of khaki pants. Together, he said, they spent the equivalent of $860 for items that would have cost less than $20 the day before. His daughter tried to comfort him. “Father, I will keep this pair of pants until I die!” she pledged. He told her the cutting board would be her wedding gift. “At that moment, I really wanted to kill myself,” he said. He gestured toward the safe-house window and beyond toward nighttime Yanji, brightly lighted and humming with traffic. “It is not like here,” he said. “Here, it is not a big deal to make money. There, it is suffering and suffering; sacrificing and sacrificing.” He said he lay awake night after night afterward, fixated on the navy track suit his daughter had coveted. She had said it put her thick winter sweater and plain trousers to shame. He had put her off because the cheapest ones were nearly $15. When she brought it up once too often, he had cursed and shouted, “People in this house need to eat first!” “I cannot describe how terrible I feel that I didn’t buy that for her,” he said, his voice trembling. A Profound Isolation Those North Koreans who have never crossed the border have no way to make sense of their tribulations. There is no Internet. Television and radio receivers are soldered to government channels. Even the party official’s wife lacks a telephone and mourns her lack of contact with the outside world. Her first question to a foreigner was “Am I pretty?” Slowly, however, information is seeping in. Traders return from China to report that people are richer and comparatively freer, and that South Koreans are supposedly even more so. Some of the traders have cellphones that are linked to the Chinese cellular network and can be surreptitiously borrowed for exorbitant fees. Punishment for watching foreign films and television shows is stiff. The trader said a 35-year-old neighbor spent six months in a labor camp last year after he was caught watching “Twin Dragons,” a farcical Hong Kong action film starring Jackie Chan. Yet to the dismay of the former teacher, her 26-year-old son takes similar risks. Her sister is married to a government official in the capital, Pyongyang, she said, but neither is a fan of Kim Jong-il. On her most recent visit, she said, her sister whispered to her, “ ‘People follow him because of fear, not because of love.’ ” Since the currency devaluation, she and others say, people are noticeably bolder with such comments. “Now, if you go to the market, people will say anything,” the construction worker said. “They will say the government is a thief — even in broad daylight.” His wife was not among them. For weeks after the devaluation, he said, she lay on a living-room floor mat, immobilized by depression. “I had no strength to say anything to her,” he said. Finally, he told her to get up. It was time to start over.

High-level meetings with the U.S. ended with no immediate prospect of a U.N. resolution.

==::==
BEIJING —Chinaand the United States wrapped up three days of high-level meetings with a handful of trade and energy agreements but little progress on the most pressing American priority: winning China’s backing for new measures againstNorth Korea, whichSouth Koreahas accused of torpedoing one of its warships. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said China would take “a period of careful consideration in order to determine the best way forward in dealing with North Korea as a result of this incident,” suggesting that there was little expectation for joint action to condemn the attack. China has been reluctant to hold North Korea responsible for the sinking last March, which killed 46 sailors. As a veto-wielding member of theUnited Nations Security Council, China’s support, or at least its acquiescence, would be needed to pass any resolution against North Korea. The United States has thrown its full weight behind South Korea’s effort to take the incident to the United Nations. Mrs. Clinton spent much of her time this week huddled with Chinese officials, arguing the case that North Korea was responsible for the attack and that its aggression demanded a response. On Tuesday, she tried to put the best face on China’s position, saying that President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao had conveyed their “deep regret” at the loss of the crew. Mr. Wen will fly to Seoul on Friday to meet President Lee Myung-bak, which she said might move things forward. “We expect to be working together with China in responding to North Korea’s provocative action,” Mrs. Clinton said at a news conference after the meetings ended. “I think it is absolutely clear that China not only values but is very committed to regional stability.” But Chinese leaders did not publicly mention North Korea by name during the meeting, and China’s state councilor who oversees foreign affairs, Dai Bingguo, called on the United States and others to “calmly and appropriately handle the issue, and avoid escalation of the situation.” On the economic side of the ledger, the Americans claimed some modest progress. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner took note of President Hu’s reference to a coming reform of China’s currency policy, saying, “We welcome the fact that China’s leaders have recognized that the reform of the exchange rate is an important part of their broader reform agenda.” But he added, “This is, of course, China’s choice,” reflecting the fact that China has made clear it will not loosen the dollar peg on its currency in response to prodding by the United States. Mr. Geithner also credited China for starting to shift its economic growth from exports to domestic consumption — praise that some economists say is premature, given China’s continuing reliance on exports. The sovereign debt crisis in Greece cast a smaller shadow on the meeting, with Chinese officials worried about how it would affect exports to Europe, their largest market. Mr. Geithner played down those jitters, saying, “Europe has the capacity to manage these challenges.” The United States pointed to progress on two issues of importance to American investors: a change in Chinese rules on innovation that hurt foreign companies, and its pledge to submit a revised offer to join the World Trade Organization’s agreement on government procurement by July 2010. There were also agreements on issues like  clean energy and shale gas exploration. With few concrete policy agreements, the United States and China played up the personal side of the relationship. Mrs. Clinton took part in a ceremony to promote student exchanges. The Chinese government agreed to help pay for 10,000 students to study for doctorate degrees in the United States, while President Obama has a goal of sending 100,000 Americans to China over the next four years. The tone was even lighter in the encounters Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Geithner had with the Chinese news media. In a joint interview with Hong Kong-based Phoenix TV, they were quizzed about child-rearing and movie-going habits. (She puts up with former President Bill Clinton’s taste for action films.) On the CCTV talk show “Dialogue,” Mrs. Clinton was asked about the plans for the wedding of her daughter, Chelsea. She confessed that it was the most important thing in her life right now. Nobody asked Mrs. Clinton about human rights, and she barely mentioned it this week.

The U.S. began pressing China to back punitive measures against North Korea but U.S. officials acknowledged the Chinese were reluctant.

BEIJING — The United States began pressing the Chinese on Sunday to back punitive measures againstNorth Koreaover strong evidence it had torpedoed a South Korean warship, but American officials acknowledgedChina’s reluctance to discipline its isolated neighbor. Kicking off three days of high-level economic and security meetings here, the United States also sought to secure Chinese support for United Nations sanctions against Iran that would designate individuals and companies with ties to its nuclear and missile programs. Secretary of StateHillary Rodham Clintonmet over dinner with Dai Bingguo, a state councilor of China who oversees foreign affairs, and raised the South Korean government report thatformally accusedthe North of torpedoing the ship, theCheonan, in March, killing 46 sailors. “We want them to take some steps in the international arena to underscore the seriousness of the matter,” said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private meeting. But he added, “We have to be realistic about what we can expect.” The Chinese government, the official said, was still digesting the findings of the investigation, which was aided by the United States and other countries. China has reacted with extreme caution, waiting for days to express sorrow toSouth Koreafor the loss of the crew and expressing skepticism about North Korea’s role. Mrs. Clinton shared information from the investigation with Mr. Dai, the official said. While he said the Chinese were receptive, they had yet to commit to concrete steps against the North. He said that the historic ties between the two countries would make that difficult. On Monday, South Korea announced that  it was suspending nearly all trade with North Korea and seeking  a Security Council resolution condemning the attack. China’s support for such a resolution is viewed as critical because it holds a veto in the Council and because it exerts influence over North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-il. But in a sign of China’s reluctance, the American official said the Chinese offered few details about Mr. Kim, even though he visited China by train only a few weeks ago and was met by President Hu Jintao. “For China, they are in somewhat uncharted waters, for at least this generation of policy makers,” said the official, who called the sinking an “extraordinarily serious armistice violation.” On Iran, the United States is pushing to get China’s support for amendments to a draft Security Council resolution that would impose a fourth set of sanctions on Tehran for its defiance of United Nations nuclear inspectors. Those amendments single out individuals and companies — many affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps — with ties to the nuclear program. Last Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton announced that China had joined the United States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany in backing additional sanctions against Iran. But there are still unresolved issues relating to China’s extensive investments in Iran’s oil and gas industries. Mrs. Clinton, the official said, wanted to be “clear about what our expectations are and how to make sure we get across the finish line.” Nearly 200 American officials have descended on Beijing. Mrs. Clinton is jointly leading the delegation with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, who met on Sunday with Wang Qishan, the vice premier for economic policy. Mr. Geithner plans to press China to drop trade barriers and to shift its economy toward domestic consumption, which the United States says is important for evening trade imbalances. On the latter score, he said Sunday that China was making strides. “It looks as if there has been a durable shift towards domestic consumption in China,” he said. Mrs. Clinton did her part to pitch American exports on Sunday, visiting a Boeing maintenance facility in Shanghai to urge China to open its markets and  protect intellectual property. “American companies want to compete in China,” she said. “They want to sell goods made by American workers to Chinese consumers with rising incomes and increasing demand.” To do that, she said, the United States needs a “level playing field where domestic and international companies can compete freely and openly.” Without singling out China, she called for transparency in rule-making, greater market access for foreign companies and non-discrimination against foreign companies in government contracts.

The group of nine North Koreans entered the Danish Embassy in Hanoi seeking polical asylum and eventual transit to Seoul.

SEOUL, South Korea — Nine North Koreans entered the Danish Embassy in Hanoi,Vietnam, on Thursday seeking political asylum and passage to Seoul, South Korean activists said. The group entered Vietnam from China in recent weeks through smuggling routes, saidKim Sang-hun, a leader of the International Network of North Korean Human Rights Activists who assisted in the North Koreans’ escape to Vietnam. Among them were the 19-year-old daughter of a woman who had already defected with her son, a 42-year-old doctor and his wife and a 38-year-old woman and her daughter. The rights network said the defectors carried a message in English: “We are now at the point of such desperation and live in such fear of persecution withinNorth Koreathat we have come to the decision to risk our lives for freedom rather than passively await our doom. The only power we have left is to appeal to you on our knees and with tears.” Ole Brix Andersen, a spokesman at Denmark’s Foreign Ministry, confirmed that a group of people believed to be North Koreans had entered the embassy in Hanoi and “asked for help and protection,” The Associated Press reported. He said they would be allowed to stay at the embassy for the moment “because we do not send people out who could face some kind of persecution.” About 20,000 North Koreans have defected toSouth Koreasince the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, nearly all of them in the past 15 years. The number of defectors arriving in the South rose to 2,809 last year, as more North Koreans have learned of the South’s affluence and activists have become more skilled in smuggling them out. Since25 North Koreans made their way into the Spanish Embassyin Beijing in 2002, human rights activists have repeatedly sent North Koreans into embassies in Southeast Asia. “Perhaps this dramatic and desperate bid for freedom will prove to be an impetus to the South Korean Embassy in Vietnam to take a more proactive role in protecting North Korean refugees,” said a statement from the rights network. Human rights activists have complained that the South Korean Embassy in Vietnam, unlike other South Korean missions in Asia, was especially reluctant to accept North Korean refugees. In 2004, both Vietnam and South Korea were put in a diplomatically awkward position when there were so many North Korean refugees in the South Korean Embassy in Hanoi that the embassy flew 468 of them to Seoul. That infuriated North Korea, and South Korea said it would never undertake such a large-scale airlift again.

North and South Korea, divided by ideology and the fear inspired by the North’s development of nuclear weapons, have, for the first time, both  qualified for the same World Cup tournament. This was confirmed in Wednesday’s games of Asian regional qualification for 2010. It is the first time the North has reached the World Cup since 1966. The four certain qualifiers from Asia are Australia, Japan, North Korea and South Korea. Asia will probably add a fifth qualifier. Bahrain and Saudi Arabia play two games in September, and the winner will meet New Zealand in yet another  playoff for a place at the World Cup. And on the form of the past week, New Zealand is out of its depth: a giant in Oceania, a pygmy at world level. Yet while North Korea dourly, methodically closed out the 0-0 draw it needed to deny Saudi Arabia in Riyadh, something more than sport was happening in Seoul. Six of the Iranian players wore green wristbands in a show of solidarity with those who have marched in the streets of Tehran after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s re-election. And though five players removed the bands at half-time, the captain Mehdi Mahdavikia kept his on until the end. Mahdavikia, 31, is known in Germany, where he has played for 11 years, as a winger of pace and a man of grace. He knows the rules of the game and of life. He did everything he could in Seoul, but the 1-1 result eliminated his team from the World Cup. While the players played on, plainclothes enforcers — believed to be Iranian Embassy staff — scuffled to remove flags and banners from Iranian supporters in the Seoul stadium. “Free Iran,” one banner read. “Go to Hell Dictator,” another. The South Korean soccer association said after the game that the scuffles had been minor. That is unlikely to be how FIFA, the world governing body of soccer, sees the situation. FIFA tries to forbid political gesture of any kind in its sport. But even FIFA is aware that life is not normal in the Korean peninsula. Over the past year, it has had to order North Korea to play its home match against the South on neutral territory in Shanghai because the North refused to allow the South’s flag or anthem in Pyongyang. After the return match in Seoul, the North protested that its 1-0 defeat had been the consequence of deliberate poisoning of its players’ food and of bias by the Omani referee. The bare facts are that North Korea’s concentration on defense eked out just enough points. In eight games in the final Asian group phase, it scored just seven goals, but conceded only five. In its preliminary qualifying stage, its defense was broken only once in six games. All this seems reminiscent of Italy, which North Korea famously beat, 1-0, during the World Cup in England in 1966. The acrimony in sports that mirrors the politics seems far from the spirit of the two Koreas marching as one at the Olympics in Athens or at the Asian Games. “We have two teams, but we are the same blood,” Yun Jong-su, the North Korea coach, said in 2004. “At the moment, we are separate, but I hope someday both can qualify for the World Cup, and go there unified.” Those hopes seem further off now. Jong’s reference to the same blood reminds me of one of the most poignant days of my 40 years covering sports. It was dawn in April 1996 when, from his apartment overlooking the Han River in Seoul, an aging man described his feelings of being exiled in the South, but having played as goalie in both the Koreas. Hong Duk-young was the South’s goalkeeper at the 1954 World Cup in Korea, and later a referee. Beneath his apartment the next day, I joined in a match on a gravel pitch on the riverbank. The participants were mostly septuagenarians. Each morning at 7, whatever the weather, they turned out for the North Korea Five-Provinces Ex-pats players. One of those players, Park Hyung-kun, was 76. Thin and wiry, opaque of eye but sharp in his mind, Park lived to play those games. “We all do,” he said. Born in the North, exiled to the South, Park said that he dreamed that his brothers, his cousins, his kinfolk would be playing the game across the border. “One day we hope to play our brothers,” he said. “Maybe if we get to the World Cup, it will start a dialogue. “Maybe then I could play or at least be buried in the goalmouth of my birthplace, Hwanghae Province.” His dream is no closer than it seemed in 1988, when the Olympics were held in Seoul. The world came to play, but Pyongyang remained closed to the games. A window shuttered. Now, at last, the Koreas are invited to the same World Cup, in South Africa 2010.

South Korea’s reluctance to challenge threats from its neighbor made it difficult in the past to enact or enforce tough sanctions on North Korea.

SEOUL,South Korea— After years of incendiary threats and weapons tests, the world has become accustomed to provocations fromNorth Korea. More unusual this time is that South Korea is pushing back. After North Korea’s nuclear test last week, South Korea swiftly moved to join an American-led effort to search ships for unconventional weapons, despite threats of war from the North if its ships were boarded. South Korea has also lobbiedChinaand Russia to take a unified stance against the North, and supported calls at the United Nations Security Council for new sanctions. The assertive moves by South Korea’s right-leaning and generally pro-American president,Lee Myung-bak, are a sharp departure from the conciliatory stance that the South took in previous standoffs, particularly after the North’s first nuclear, test three years ago, when it continued economic aid and investment. South Korea’s reluctance to challenge threats from its neighbor, along with China’s more accommodating policies, made it difficult in the past to enact or enforce tough sanctions on North Korea. Now, the South’s decision to stop acting as the North’s leading protector may open a wider range of options in responding to the nuclear and missile tests, analysts say. “South Korean aid gave North Korea leverage against the United States,” said Choi Jin-wook, a North Korea specialist at theKorea Institute for National Unification, a state-run research organization. “Lee Myung-bak has emptied their pockets and weakened their bargaining position.” It remains to be seen how much that will translate into punitive actions against the North at the United Nations, where the five permanent Security Council members — Russia, China, the United States, Britain and France — have been joined by Japan and South Korea in trying to hammer out a new resolution that includes sanctions. There is broad agreement on the need to send a tough message to North Korea, senior diplomats have said, but less consensus on what that should be. Given thesensitivitiesof China, which is the North’s one ally, the resolution will probably not involve any new sanctions. Instead, it may impose some of those approved in the resolution after the 2006 nuclear test but never enacted because the North cooperated in entering six-party talks on its weapons program. That earlier  resolution focused on cutting trade and financing for North Korea’s military and hampering the ruling elite with a ban on the import of luxury goods. No one expects rapid action, however. “It is not a normal country, so we have to act cautiously,” Zhang Yesui, the Chinese ambassador to the United Nations, said in an interview on Friday. “It is a very closed place, so they act abnormally.” It is not even clear that China has the influence to sway the North Korean government, he added. It is also unclear how far South Korea is willing to push the North, whose troops and artillery sit just 35 miles north of Seoul along the heavily fortified demilitarized zone. While Mr. Lee did gain office last year promising a tougher line, most South Koreans still abhor tensions with the North and are fundamentally in favor of reconciliation, said North Korea experts. “If North Korea actually tests South Korea’s resolve, it will put South Korea in a very tough spot,” said Kim Il-young, a North Korea specialist at Seoul’s Sungkyunkwan University. Indeed, South Korean officials have been careful to cast their new approach not as a drastic departure but as more a shift in tone. They say the South remains willing to offer economic aid to the North, but only if it responds with good-faith efforts to curtail its weapons programs. They also say that they are not trying to provoke the North, which has seemed particularly volatile since its leader,Kim Jong-il, appears to have had a stroke in August. “This is not at all a hawkish or hard line,” said Kim Tae-hyo, the secretary to Mr.  Lee for national security. “We still seek contacts with the North. Where we differ is that we demand mutual respect and reciprocity.” Still, by moving the nation closer to Washington, the South Korean president’s approach has deprived North Korea of one of its usual policy options in such standoffs: driving a wedge between Seoul and its traditional allies in Washington and Tokyo. Emblematic of Seoul’s new tilt toward the United States was its sudden decision on Tuesday to join the  Proliferation Security Initiative, the effort  to stop global trafficking in unconventional weapons, after years of refusing to do so for fear of riling the North. North Korea responded by reiterating that it would consider any search of its ships to be an act of war. Even during the current crisis, however, South Korean officials said they were still trying to reach out to the North. They also said they were talking with China, Russia, Japan and the United States about putting together  a “grand plan” of aid and other economic incentives to persuade the North to dismantle its nuclear program. As a possible model, they cite Ukraine, which relinquished its Soviet-made nuclear arsenal in exchange for a huge aid package and entree to the West. However, with the North’s fear of the instability that greater openness could bring, many analysts doubt  that even a generous aid package could coax it to end its weapons program. The emerging view here is that last Monday’s nuclear test and the ensuing series of test missile launchings reflect North Korea’s attempt to ensure its survival by creating an independent nuclear deterrent. The displays of technological achievement are also seen as a bid to create domestic support for the ill  leader and his moves to install a successor, South Korean officials said. South Korean officials play down their role in provoking the North, saying officials in Pyongyang are engaging in the same brand of nuclear brinkmanship they have used  in previous crises, though with a markedly faster pace. They say that despite the North’s recent threats against the South, the main target audience remains the United States, with which  the North wants to hold bilateral negotiations on a new footing as a nuclear nation. “You can’t connect the dots between South Korean policy changes and the scale and pace of North Korea’s current provocations,” said Wi Sung-lac, the South Korean Foreign Ministry’s top negotiator on Korean peninsula security affairs.

WASHINGTON — The United States,South Koreaand Japan are all balking atChina’s request for emergency talkswithNorth Koreaover the crisis on the Korean Peninsula, as high-profile military exercises between South Korea and the United States in the Yellow Sea continued on Monday in a show of force. Obama administration officials said that a return to the table with North Korea, asChinasought this weekend, would be rewarding the North for provocative behavior over the past week, including itsdeadly artillery attackon a South Korean island andits disclosure of a uranium enrichment plant. Beijing called for emergency talks with North Korea, the United States, Japan, South Korea and Russia, participants in the six-party nuclear talks, which have been suspended indefinitely. “The United States and a host of others, I don’t think, are not interested in stabilizing the region through a series of P.R. activities,” said Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesman. He said that the talks “without an understanding and agreement from the North Koreans to both end their behavior as they exhibited last week, but also to come to the table with a seriousness of purpose on the denuclearization issue — without that seriousness of purpose, they’re just a P.R. activity.” Rejecting the emergency talks amounts to a pointed rebuke to China. The United States wanted China to signal clearly that North Korea’s aggressive behavior would not be tolerated. Instead, Beijing remained neutral about who was responsible for the recent flare-up, and offered only to provide a venue for all sides to air their differences. Yet turning down China’s offer may also reveal the limited options available to the Obama administration and the South Korean leadership. Aside from a show of military solidarity, the two countries have based their response largely on hopes that China, as the North’s main economic and diplomatic supporter, might punish the reclusive government for its series of provocations. Mr. Gibbs and other administration officials said that the United States also wanted to see North Korea take steps to denuclearize, which most Asia analysts said might be a tall order for the North at a time when its government is undergoing a leadership crisis. South Korea and Japan are also clearly skeptical of whether the consultations, as suggested by the Chinese, are worth a try. PresidentLee Myung-bakof South Korea and Prime Minister Naoto Kan of Japan on Monday both denounced what they called North Korea’s brutality. President Lee pointedly said nothing about the Chinese proposal; analysts in Seoul described it as disappointingly familiar. A spokesman for the Japanese prime minister said that while Japan is cautiously reviewing China’s offer, talks hinge on whether North Korea changes it behavior. It remains unclear just what the United States would actually accept from North Korea to return to talks. One Obama administration official said that the United States wanted a clear sign that the North “will stop provocative behavior.” “We’re trying to get out of this cycle where they act up and we talk,” the official said. He spoke on grounds of anonymity under diplomatic rules. Separately, South Korea’s military appeared to step back from one confrontational stance, canceling live-fire artillery drills on the island in the Yellow Sea attacked by the North a week ago. While the military exercises continued, the prospect of the South Korean live-fire drills — scheduled for Tuesday but canceled within four hours of the announcement — had been sharpening tensions on a peninsula on tenterhooks after the North’s artillery attack last week on a garrison island that is also home to about 1,350 civilians, mainly fishermen. The attack killed two South Korean marines and two civilians, and wounded 18 people. North Korea blamed the South for provoking the attack by firing at it from the island, Yeonpyeong, which lies in waters disputed by the two sides. The South, which returned fire, insisted it had been firing only test shots and that none were in territory it recognized as the North’s. The United States announced the date of the joint exercises as an immediate response. China — which the United States, South Korea and other countries hoped would act to calm the North — responded by warning the United States not to operate in waters it claims as a sovereign zone. In Washington, the Pentagon cited security concerns and declined to say precisely where in the Yellow Sea the exercises were taking place. But a military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity acknowledged that some of the exercises might be within 200 nautical miles of the Chinese coast. China defines that zone as within its exclusive sovereignty, but the United States and many other nations do not recognize its claim. “We have a large operating area and some of it may be, and some of it may not be” within 200 miles of China’s eastern border, the official said. South Korea naval authorities on Yeonpyeong warned residents by loudspeaker on Monday afternoon that they should move to bomb shelters by 9:30 a.m. Tuesday morning because live-fire drills would take place at 10 a.m. But Monday night, they announced that no firing would take place. A South Korean military official declined to explain the shift, saying only that the exercise “will be conducted at an appropriate time.” At the United Nations, the Obama administration called for tighter enforcement of sanctions against North Korea. The Security Council met on Monday to discuss the crisis, but did not emerge with any new plans for what to do next, further reflecting the mounting frustration in the international community over how to rein in North Korea. Diplomats said that at the moment, the most they could do was to try to make sure countries enforce existing sanctions against North Korea, including an arms embargo and a travel ban against people linked to the country’snuclear weaponsprogram. Susan E. Rice, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters that the United States looked “to China to play a responsible leadership role in working to maintain peace and security in that region.” White House officials said last week that Mr. Obama planned to call President Hu Jintao of China to discuss the crisis in the Korean Peninsula. Mr. Gibbs said Monday afternoon that the call had not happened yet.

SEOUL,South Korea— South Korea andJapanclosed ranks onNorth Koreaon Friday, adding a new demand to their proposed bargain for the North to abandon its nuclear program and vowing to enforce United Nations sanctions until they are convinced that the country will do so. On Saturday in Beijing, China joined the other two countries in calling for an early resumption of the six-party talks aimed at endingNorth Korea’s nuclear weaponsambitions, Reuters reported. The plea for the renewal of the talks, “so as to safeguard peace and stability in Northeast Asia,” came in a statement issued at the end of a meeting of Premier Wen Jiabao of China, President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea and the new Japanese prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama. In Seoul on Friday, President Lee and Prime Minister Hatoyama, who share skepticism about the North Korean government’s intentions, reaffirmed their united stance when they met to prepare for the meeting in China. Mr. Lee said during a news conference here with Mr. Hatoyama that their nations would keep the door open for dialogue, but would also enforce the sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council after the North’s ballistic missile and nuclear tests this year. “We agreed that North Korea must show a fundamental change in its attitude,” Mr. Lee said. The two leaders also amended their “grand bargain” — a term used by Mr. Lee to describe a sweeping set of incentives for an immediate halt to the North’s nuclear program — to include a new demand: a full North Korean accounting of the fate of Japanese citizens believed to have been kidnapped and taken to North Korea in recent decades. Mr. Lee and Mr. Hatoyama flew to Beijing later Friday for a meeting with Mr. Wen, who had returned Tuesday from a meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il. Mr. Wen madea three-day journey this week to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, and won a vaguely worded promise from Mr. Kim that his government would return to the six-nation nuclear disarmament talks — but only if it saw progress in bilateral talks with Washington. In return, China agreed to ship aid and increase economic exchanges with the North. That deal raised fears in Seoul and Tokyo that North Korea, a pariah state, was being rewarded without making a concrete concession on itsnuclear weaponsprogram. Mr. Hatoyama defended the need for sanctions, saying, “We should not provide economic cooperation until North Korea takes concrete steps.” The Japanese have long sought to include the dispute over the abducted citizens in the “grand bargain,” which would provide North Korea with a comprehensive package of economic assistance and security assurances in return for its immediately abandoning its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Until Mr. Lee, a conservative, came to office in early 2008, South Korea had resisted injecting that dispute into the already complicated nuclear talks. The parties involved in the six-party talks are the two Koreas, the United States, China, Japan and Russia.

HONG KONG — North Korea’s murderous provocation may be having its intended effect of creating a sense of crisis in the region, which Pyongyang hopes will bring diplomatic gains. Beijing, though at one level embarrassed by the behavior of its ally, also aims to gain from the crisis atmosphere by presenting itself as part of the solution. In reality, Beijing’s failure yet again to criticize Pyongyang’s attack makes it part of the problem. Washington, Seoul and Tokyo are  right to view with skepticism Beijing’s call for a six-party meeting to discuss the crisis. Hopefully this is a sign that the United States will not be trapped into making concessions on other issues in return for promises by Beijing to help restrain North Korea from further provocations. Refusing to be provoked by Pyongyang is easier said than done if you are the president of a proud and powerful nation like South Korea, which twice in a few months has been the subject of deadly North Korean aggression, or the leader of its protector, the United States. Yet a show of force to appease the public or send a message to Beijing would also play to North Korea’s desire to deflect attention from its deliberate attack on the Yellow Sea island of Yeonpyeong toward the broader issues that are the subject of the six-party talks. It is no coincidence that the Yeonpyeong attack came just after the North had raised more alarms by taking a U.S. scientist to see a hitherto unsuspected uranium enrichment facility. But so what? It is well known that the North has nuclear capability — and no realistic way of using it other than as a diplomatic lever. It is perhaps unfortunate that the U.S.-South Korea exercises in the Yellow Sea were planned before the latest incident. Although justified by previous North Korean actions — notably the sinking in March of the South Korean Naval vessel, the Cheonan — and by rights in international waters, the military maneuvers irritate Beijing and give the impression that the world is facing an issue much broader than another Pyongyang provocation. The United States cannot punish the North militarily without risking a wider conflict that would do far more damage to the prosperous, trade-dependent South than to a North accustomed to endless hardships imposed by a brutal regime. That is the principal reason why the U.S. and South Korea should focus not on military exercises but on  diplomatic action and the withdrawal of aid and commerce. There are other reasons for  showing  restraint. One is that it is hard to figure out the  motives behind the latest attack. Was this entirely driven by Pyongyang’s desire to raise the  stakes prior to going back to the six-party talks? Or was it partly the result of Kim Jong-il’s youngest son and heir apparent, Kim Jong-un,  trying to show that he was prepared for  leadership and willing to indulge the  military’s dominance? Or was it the result of an internal power struggle involving senior military figures and relatives of the Kim dynasty? Or did it reflect a desire to be noticed, born out of frustration that  Seoul recently strutted on the world  stage as host of the G-20 summit? Pyongyang’s actions initially caused far more diplomatic damage to the North than to the South. The attacks have been a reminder that China has recently given a lot to the North  by apparently offering its blessing to the dynastic succession and in praising Pyongyang for “resisting U.S. aggression.” Coming soon after the Cheonan sinking, this latest attack has brought Seoul and Washington closer together at a time when economic issues were strengthening the South’s links with China. It also seemed to justify the harder-line stance toward the North taken by President Lee Myung-bak compared with his predecessor. Of the other regional players, the Russians are annoyed and Japan will see this as another reason to reaffirm its U.S. alliance. But there is now a very real danger of a U.S. overreaction to provocation that would deliver benefits to North Korea. The best policy is to ignore Pyongyang’s bravado and threats and  be wary of China’s offers to mediate. In the short term at least, it would be wiser for Washington and its allies to treat North Korea’s histrionics with disdain and not be dragged into a contrived crisis.

Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, citing unnamed intelligence sources, said that the plane appeared to be a Soviet-eraMiG-21 jet, a craft used by the North’s air force, and that the pilot might have been trying to defect to Russia but lost course. Although thousands of North Koreans have fled their repressive home country in the past decade and a half, it is highly unusual for an elite pilot to defect. A North Korean pilot flew his MiG-19 to defect to South Korea in 1983. Another North Korean pilot did the same in 1996. China’s official policy is to return North Korean defectors, though in practice it allows many to stay quietly. Quoting an unidentified South Korean military official, Yonhap said the jet took off from an airfield in Sinuiju, a North Korean town on the far western border with China about 125 miles from the site of the crash.Xinhua saidthe plane crashed into a house in a rural area of Liaoning Province, which bordersNorth Korea. The Chinese report, which described the crash as an accident, said that no one on the ground was killed or injured. Cao Yunjuan, a 54-year-old farmer in Fushun County, where the crash occurred, said that she saw the plane going down but that she heard no explosion. “Around 3 p.m. yesterday, I saw a small plane going down and soon it disappeared from my view,” she said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. “There was no blast, though.” Ms. Cao said that she lived less than a mile from the crash site and that she and other villagers went to see the wreckage before the area was cordoned off by the police. Many saw a North Korean emblem on the plane’s tail. Photographs of what appear to be the crash site show a North Korean star on the wreckage.

Washington THE Bush administration can point to precious few successes in its efforts to curb North Korea’s mounting menace — even last week’s celebrated nuclear deal with Kim Jong-il’s government is, for the moment, little more than a written promise from a highly unreliable negotiating partner. Yet inexplicably, the Bush team continues to overlook a spectacular opportunity to deliver freedom to tens of thousands of North Koreans, to pressure the country from within for fundamental change and to lay the groundwork for a peaceful, reunified Korean Peninsula. By fostering an underground railroad to rescue North Korean refugees living in China, the United States could do all these things at once. On humanitarian grounds alone, the case for action on behalf of the wretched North Koreans in hiding north of their country’s border along the Yalu River is compelling. While the exact numbers are unknown, this  refugee emergency may be  second only to Darfur: the International Crisis Group speaks of scores of thousands of refugees, and recently uncovered Chinese official documents indicate hundreds of thousands. As illegal immigrants in China (Beijing insists North Korean border-crossers are economic migrants, or worse), they live in constant fear and at terrible risk.  Women are forced into the sex trade or coerced marriages; men and children on the run have less obvious utility and thus, by some accounts, correspondingly higher mortality. Yet the North Korean refugees who  end up as victims of exploitation, violence or crime in China may be the lucky ones. A far worse fate awaits those whom China “refouls,” or deports to North Korea in violation of Beijing’s commitments under the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. North Korea regards fleeing Kim Jong-il’s paradise as an act of disloyalty close to treason. Captives forcibly returned to North Korea face prison, torture and death, attesting to the refugee status that official Chinese wordplay denies. Despite a gradually hardening Chinese posture toward this humanitarian crisis (now entering its second decade), over the years a few private groups have been bravely spiriting refugees out of China and into third countries. Intrepid souls like Steve Kim of New York (jailed in China since 2003), Phillip Buck from Seattle (jailed for 15 months in 2005-2006), Adrian Hong (deported last December) and others from America, South Korea and elsewhere have rescued thousands of North Koreans from China, often by way of an arduous 6,000-mile overland journey into Southeast Asia, where  North Korean refugees can seek resettlement in states that  accept them. The desperation of North Korean refugees has also attracted  unscrupulous entrepreneurs who guide refugees out of China for a profit. This latter-day flesh trade has been criticized by the governments of China and South Korea — each eager, for its own reasons, to discredit any efforts at exodus from North Korea. But whether created by noble motives  or mercenary ones, this continuing trickle of escapees proves that a path to freedom already exists. And that trickle would grow if these North Koreans  knew they could count on official protection along the way. Some will worry loudly about international resettlement for tens (never mind hundreds) of thousands of North Korean refugees, but the logistical issues are basically solved in advance: as a matter of national law, South Korea is obliged to welcome them all. Under Articles 2 and 3 of the Republic of Korea’s Constitution, as reaffirmed by the country’s  Supreme Court in 1996, every North Korean refugee has the right to resettle in South Korea. Commitments by Washington and other free governments to take in North Korean refugees are desirable and commendable (the United States is already committed to doing so under the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004), but it is natural and fitting that South Korea should be the destination for the overwhelming majority of North Korea’s freedom-seekers. The critical missing piece for getting this underground railroad up and running is safe passage through China. But because the  South Korean government fears antagonizing the North  and the  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is too timid to face down Beijing,  China’s opposition to this rescue mission has gone unchallenged. Only the United States is in a position to help overcome Beijing’s recalcitrance. The Chinese government’s cost-benefit calculus regarding these refugees would change drastically  if Washington weighed in as their advocate. If the United States (along with other governments) provided informal assurances that  China is merely a way station for North Koreans — assuaging any official fears about a permanent foreign refugee population — it may well be possible to convince Beijing to cooperate in the relocation mission (or at least to look the other way as it takes place). Should it do so, many of the problems that Beijing seems to fear will vanish of themselves: if those refugees can be quickly processed by the United Nations refugee commission  or similar offices, for example, Beijing need no longer worry about the risks imposed by a large, illegal population along its border with North Korea. Additionally, with United States leadership, Seoul and the United Nations lose their cover for ignoring the North Korean refugee crisis. The governments and  organizations  that have responded to the calamity  in Darfur could also be rallied to the front lines for North Korean refugees. And, under the international spotlight, Seoul would be forced to observe its constitutional pledge of citizenship for all Koreans despite the current South Korean government’s obvious reluctance to displease Kim Jong-il on any issue. Humanitarian rescue of North Korean refugees will also materially advance United States security interests. Mass defections from North Korea strike at the heart of the Kim  regime, giving the lie to the myths upon which North Korean rule is based. This would further undercut the regime’s authority and legitimacy, and force it for the first time to respond to the concerns of its subjects. A North Korean underground railroad is only a first step toward an entirely free Korean Peninsula, but a terribly important one. Bringing North Korean refugees to freedom will redound only to America’s strategic advantage and will give tangible proof to the seriousness of this country’s  freedom agenda. America — and any American president — could take pride in such a legacy.

BEIJING —Chinamoved over the weekend to defuse the latest crisis on the Korean Peninsula, publicly calling on Sunday for “emergency consultations” while beginning what amounted to high-level shuttle diplomacy between North andSouth Korea. Together, the moves by China were its first concerted diplomatic intervention to calm the emotions that have dangerously escalated sinceNorth Korea’slethal shellinglast Tuesday of a South Korean island in the disputed border area between them. Even so, the Chinese response, which appeared to be studiously neutral, was far from what either South Korea or the United States had publicly sought from China, which provides critical economic aid to the North and is believed to have the most leverage on North Korea’s reclusive government. American officials had wanted China to single out the North as an aggressor in this case, as well as criticize the North over its recent unveiling of a new plant foruranium enrichment. South Korea’s president,Lee Myung-bak,  said in a televised speech on Monday in Seoul that if the North acted provocatively again, “We will make sure it pays a dear price without fail.” President Lee made no mention of China’s diplomacy. Chinese analysts said Beijing’s solutions were not perfect but were the best it could do. “North Korea is not the kind of country that if its neighbor severs economic assistance it will bow down and listen to it,” said Liu Ming of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. “China knows this, so it cannot do much more.” The Chinese effort came as the United States, South Korea’s most powerful ally,began naval war gameswith South Korean forces in the Yellow Sea in response to the shelling, a move that both China and North Korea have criticized as provocative. In a hastily called news conference in Beijing, the Chinese government asked for South Korea, North Korea, the United States, Japan and Russia to convene what it described as emergency consultations in Beijing next month as a way to avoid a further deterioration of the situation. The countries have been participants in the so-called six-party talks that have been held intermittently — and unsuccessfully — for years over ways to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. China also sent a top foreign policy official, State Councilor Dai Bingguo, to South Korea over the weekend and announced that a North Korean official would travel to Beijing on Tuesday, in what appeared to be an attempt at mediation, something unusual for China in its complex relationship with the Koreas. It was unclear whether China’s efforts were a response to the repeated calls by both the Obama administration and South Korea’s government for the Chinese to exert influence on North Korea. Publicly at least, American officials were unimpressed with China’s response. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton talked with Mr. Dai by telephone on Sunday, telling him that China’s call for emergency consultations could not substitute for action by North Korea, said the State Department spokesman, Philip J. Crowley. He said Mrs. Clinton told Mr. Dai that North Korea’s behavior was “destabilizing,” adding that “clear steps by North Korea are needed to demonstrate a change of behavior.” South Korea, for its part, appeared equally unimpressed. Many South Koreans made pointed references to President Lee’sstatementin which he “urged Beijing to play a role befitting its newfound international prestige.” Especially annoying to many South Koreans is that China failed to criticize North Korea for the artillery barrage, which was the first attack on civilian  areas since the armistice that halted the 1950-53 Korean War. Instead, China’s state-run media gave equal prominence to North Korea’s claim that the United States masterminded the crisis. “This is disappointing,” said Yoon Duk-min, a regional security specialist at the Institute for Foreign Affairs and National Security in Seoul. “The six-party talks are a dialogue to solve the nuclear issue, not the current crisis on the peninsula.” Kim Yong-hyun, professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University, said South Korea was unlikely to accept China’s offer because it would seem to come as a result of North Korean violence. “Maybe after time passes, but not now,” he said. But in Washington, some Asia experts said that the reality was that the United States and South Korea would eventually have little choice but to go along with China’s call for talks, if for no other reason than to defuse the tension and prevent North Korea from taking even more aggressive or drastic actions against its neighbor to the south. “Ultimately, you have to talk with them,” said George Perkovich, an arms control expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “You have to bargain, because if you don’t, this is what they do. They make things worse. They create a crisis.” He pointed to other times when North Korea has called attention to itself while American leaders were preoccupied or refusing to hold direct talks with the North. In several of those cases, North Korea made aggressive moves toward South Korea. But President Obama is under political pressure at home to appear tough, especially on China. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican from South Carolina and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told “Fox News Sunday” that the United States “should push China hard” to get North Korea to refrain from aggressive actions. Senator John McCain, speaking on “State of the Union” on CNN, also criticized the Chinese. “We have to understand that China is not behaving in a responsible fashion as a world power,” Mr. McCain said. China has balked at pushing North Korea too hard because it does not want the North Korean government to fall, which could lead to reunification of North and South Korea. Many Asia experts say that reunification would result in a country that is far more an ally of the United States than of China, and could lead to American troops right on the Chinese border — an outcome that Beijing is loath to see happen. But China also does not want a war, which could destabilize the entire region and do severe damage to China’s own economic growth and aspirations for greater influence in the world. Hence China’s unusually high-profile efforts to defuse the crisis. “I think it is a dramatic change of Chinese policy to address its growing concern,” said Zhu Feng, deputy director of the Center for International and Strategic Studies at Peking University. “This initiative shows that Beijing is more proactive.” Some say that China had no choice because the crisis was complicating its goal of controlling the Yellow Sea, a body of water China wishes to dominate in the way that the United States controls the Gulf of Mexico. Now, because of North Korea’s shelling, a United States aircraft carrier is participating in war games there, upsetting the Chinese. “It’s what they didn’t need,” said Andrew Gilholm, Northeast Asia analyst in Shanghai for the Control Risks Group, a London-based consulting firm. “They’re trying to squeeze out U.S. influence in the region.” Michael J. Green, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said that while China was genuinely worried — both about North Korea’s volatility and the growing United States presence in Asia — the six-party talks were no longer a credible approach. “This is the Chinese default position every time,” he said. “The question is, will the Obama administration fall for it?”

Comments by Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China represented a shift since the sinking of a South Korean warship in March.

SEOUL, South Korea — Prime Minister Wen Jiabao ofChinapromised on Friday that Beijing “will not protect anyone” once it had concluded who was responsible for thesinking of a South Korean warshipin March. Mr. Wen, who came here for three-party talks this weekend withSouth Koreaand Japan, made his remarks in a meeting with the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak. China has faced growing pressure to rein inNorth Korea, its traditional ally, since an international investigative teamplaced blamefor the warship’s sinking, and the death of 46 sailors, on a North Korean torpedo. South Korea is pushing for the United Nations Security Council to censure the North. Mr. Wen told Mr. Lee that China would make an “impartial judgment” on who was responsible for the sinking, said Mr. Lee’s spokesman, Lee Dong-kwan. “Once we have our conclusion, we will not protect anyone,” Mr. Wen was quoted by the spokesman as saying, words that seemed to represent a shift away from China’s former calls for calm on all sides. In its report on the talks in Seoul, China’s official Xinhua news agency made no mention of Mr. Wen’s pledge, but it did quote him as saying that China would assess the matter in an “objective and fair manner.” During the meeting, Mr. Lee made a detailed case as to why China should join international condemnation of North Korea, his aides said. Mr. Wen is trying to balance China’s inclination to shield North Korea from further sanctions against the expectations of South Korea and Japan, its third and fourth largest trading partners, that Beijing will be a force for regional stability. On Friday, Japan said it would limit cash remittances to North Korea from Koreans in Japan. South Korean officials have said they do not expect Beijing to rebuke the North at the Security Council, where South Korea,with American and Japanese support, will seek condemnation of the North next month. South Korea is not seeking the imposition of new sanctions but wants to secure broad agreement, particularly with China, on the “will and intention to continue and deepen the existing sanctions,” a senior government official told foreign correspondents in Seoul on Friday. Young technocrats in Beijing have begun to have “a new thinking” about China’s ties with North Korea, the official said. But “at the top level,” the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity, “I don’t see any serious change.” “There are only a few top-ranking old people who can decide China’s North Korea policy,” he said. “That’s the reality.” Ever since investigators concluded last week that a North Korean submarine torpedoed the 1,200-tonCheonanwarship, international attention has focused on Beijing. Without the support of China, the North’s biggest trading partner and benefactor, any campaign to formally punish the North is likely to fizzle. So far, China has not formally endorsed the investigative report. North Korea has denied responsibility for sinking theCheonanand has warned that any retaliation or punishment could lead to war. On Friday, the National Defense Commission, the North’s highest ruling agency, headed by the country’s leader, Kim Jong-il, issued a rebuttal of the major points on the investigative report, which it called a “fake.” North Korea does not own a 130-ton minisubmarine of the sort the South said was used to attack the warship, Maj. Gen. Pak Rim-su, a commission official, said at a news conference in the North’s capital, Pyongyang, according to the North’s official news agency, K.C.N.A. Nor did the North distribute brochures containing the specifications of its torpedoes to foreign clients, he said. The South Korean Defense Ministry cited such brochures in support of its report. General Pak repeated the North’s warning that the Korean Peninsula was heading to “the brink of war.” Mr. Wen was the first Chinese leader to meet Mr. Lee since South Korea formally accused the North of torpedoing its ship. He will also meet Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama of Japan at the three-nation regional summit meeting on the resort island of Cheju over the weekend. Japan, which already bans trade with the North, said Friday that it would lower the limit on the amount of undeclared cash that could be carried to North Korea to 100,000 yen, or about $1,100, from the current 300,000 yen, or $3,300. The maximum amount that can be sent to North Korea without being reported to the Japanese government was lowered to $33,000 from $110,000.

The standard routine on North Korea continues at the U.N. Security Council:  condemnation, a round of sanctions and then gridlock in enforcing them, due primarily to the competing interests of the major powers. This marks another embarrassment for the international community and, above all, China, which  often fails to assume its share of responsibility.   Beijing must assume a more vocal stance beyond standard platitudes and in full coordination with the other  powers. The more states participate, the more effective  the measures. Chinese reluctance should not prevent  decisive action by others, particularly when it comes to interdicting and  inspecting North Korean ships. Discussions among major powers must also include contingency plans to deal with the worst-case scenarios of a North Korean collapse. In the U.S., pundits lead the charge in the  blame-game.  George W. Bush’s critics regard North Korea as another one of his failures.  President  Obama’s detractors condemn him for failing to use his mystical rhetoric to stop North Korea. The reality is that the country  can only be dealt with collectively.    Failure to wake up to  the alarm bells will result in a horrifically rude awakening. Marco Vicenzino,  Washington One-sided on Russia While your criticism of Russia for vetoing the continued presence of U.N.   monitors in Abkhazia may have some  legitimacy (“Small minds in the Kremlin,” editorial, June 20-21), your conclusions  are woefully one-sided. It is nonsense to argue that  Russian backing for the Abkhazians or support from the latter for Russian forces in Georgia last year makes Abkhazia’s cause less worthy of international support. In fact, without a Russian military presence in Abkhazia today, the region would once again be overrun by Georgia. Russian overlordship, of course, blocks true independence, but for now most Abkhazians appear ready to trust the devil they don’t know  — Russia  —  to the devil they do  — Georgia. Gordon M.

SEOUL, South Korea — Foreign ministers of the United States,North Koreaand four other countries will meet in Singapore next week for discussions on ending North Korea’s nuclear weapons programs, a South Korean government official said on Friday. The meeting, which would bring together Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and North Korean Foreign Minister Pak Ui-chun, is likely to take place on Wednesday on the sidelines of an Asian security forum where all the six nations are members, the official said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because China, the country organizing the talks, had not made a formal announcement. There was no immediate confirmation of the prospective meeting by the United States. The six-nation gathering — which also includes South Korea, Japan, China and Russia — will be “informal” and is not expected to produce an agreement, the official said. Still, the meeting, which follows recent progress in the nuclear disarmament talks, will add weight to the six-nation process. It will be the first time the countries’ most senior diplomats will have met as a group over North Korea since the six nations began negotiations on ending the North’s nuclear weapons programs in 2003. Ms. Rice and the Mr. Pak, the North Korean foreign minister, have never held a bilateral meeting, though their predecessors, Colin Powell and Paik Nam-sun, met. Last month, North Korea delivered a long-delayed but limited declaration of its nuclear assets, and the United States reciprocated by removing the country from its terrorism blacklist. Earlier this month, the six nations also reported progress in establishing a mechanism to verify North Korea’s nuclear declaration. They still face more complex talks on dismantling the North’s nuclear facilities, including its nuclear bombs and fissile material.

SEOUL, South Korea —President Obamadelivered a stern message on Thursday toNorth KoreaandIranthat they risk further sanctions and isolation if they do not rein in their nuclear ambitions. Appearing at a joint press conference with President Lee Myung-bak ofSouth Korea, Mr. Obama singled out Iran, where leaders have apparently rejected an offer from the West to take Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium to another country to turn it into fuel rods, which would buy time for diplomatic negotiations. “We’ve seen indications that for internal political reasons or perhaps because they are stuck in some of their own rhetoric, they are unable to get to ‘yes,’ ” Mr. Obama said. “As a consequence, we have begun discussion with our international partners” on sanctions, he said. He said that over the next few weeks the United States would be developing a package of “potential steps we can take that will indicate our seriousness.” Mr. Obama’s words were his strongest to date and seemed to signal that he was ready to move to sanctions. On the North, Mr. Obama said he was sending his North Korea envoy to Pyongyang next month for talks designed to try to get the nation back to the bargaining table. But he warned that even getting the North back to the table would not be enough. “I want to emphasize that President Lee and I both agree on the need to break the pattern that existed in the past in which North Korea behaves in a provocative fashion, then is willing to return to talks, and then talks for a while, and then leaves the talks and seeks further concessions,” Mr. Obama said. Mr. Obama’s visit to Seoul is the last — and perhaps easiest — leg of an Asia trip in which he was forced to deal with a newly assertive Japan and an increasingly powerful China. South Korea quickly proved true the predictions that it would be more accommodating to Mr. Obama, with whom Mr. Lee has been cooperating closely on key issues, including efforts to eventually haltNorth Korea’s nuclear program. On Thursday morning, the Koreans put on a rousing welcoming ceremony for Mr. Obama. On the terraced lawn in front of the Blue House, the presidential offices in Seoul, a colorful array of ceremonial guardsmen, band members and local children greeted Mr. Obama, playing “The Star-Spangled Banner” and waving American flags. South Korean government officials and diplomatic analysts said that the visit represented a chance for Seoul to raise its profile with the Obama administration by stressing its reliability as a partner in Asia. Mr. Lee is more closely aligned with American policy than were his liberal predecessors, who saw President George W. Bush’s tough stance on North Korea as counterproductive, and he was elected on a platform of getting tough with Pyongyang. But Mr. Lee has been criticized by the left for his decision to send more aid workers and a small military contingent to Afghanistan in support of the American-led effort there. During large antigovernment protests last year over beef imports from the United States — an issue that tapped into an undercurrent of anti-American feelings — Mr. Lee was accused of kowtowing to American leaders. In anticipation of demonstrators this visit, the government says it will deploy about 13,000 police and soldiers. The only potential point of contention on the visit was that Washington still was not moving to ratify a free-trade agreement agreed upon two years ago. Mr. Obama said that he wanted to get it done but acknowledged that “there is obviously a concern in the United States of the incredible trade imbalances that have grown in the past few years.”

American officials say there is disagreement within China about how to respond to North Korea, pitting civilian party leaders against the military.
==::==

==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — When Secretary of StateHillary Rodham Clintonon Wednesday declared America’s solidarity withSouth Koreain its mounting confrontation withNorth Korea, she had more than a domestic audience in mind: she was also speaking to the Chinese. “We believe it’s in everyone’s interest, includingChina, to make a persuasive case for North Korea to change direction,” Mrs. Clinton said after meeting South Korea’s president,Lee Myung-bak. She implored the Chinese to study the 400-page South Korean government report that concluded that the North torpedoed a South Korean warship in March, killing 46 sailors. And she promoted a visit to Seoul on Friday by the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, which American officials hope will open the door for Beijing’s support of a United Nations resolution condemning the attack. The American effort to muster Chinese backing for South Korea is emerging as a test case for how the Obama administration handles China, a nation that is more assertive on the world stage, yet possessed of some of the same insecurities and internal divisions that have long preoccupied its leaders. While China’s decision-making on core foreign policy issues tends to be secretive, American officials said they had picked up hints that there was some disagreement within the leadership about how to respond to North Korea’s behavior, pitting civilian party leaders against the military. The debate surfaced last year after North Korea tested a nuclear device, American officials said, and has accelerated since the attack on the South Korean ship, theCheonan. Chinese civilian leaders have expressed growing puzzlement and anger about the North’s behavior, these officials said, while military officials tend to see the North’s moves as more defensible given the threat North Korea perceives from the United States. China and North Korea, onetime ideological allies, conduct their relations through their ruling parties. But the two militaries, which fought together against the United States and South Korea during the Korean War, have their own close ties. “There is profound frustration with North Korean behavior and with the way in which it complicates China’s own security calculations,” said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. The United States and South Korea, for example, have agreed to conduct joint naval exercises in the waters off the Korean Peninsula. Their troops are working together to increase military preparedness. Japan dropped its resistance to a deal to relocate a Marine Corps air base on the island of Okinawa, driven in part by fears of hostility in its neighborhood. These developments were noticed in Beijing, which views them as an impediment to its own ambitions, officials said. Recognizing the influential role of the Chinese military, the United States is working to restore military-to-military contacts. They were cut off by China this year after Washington sold weapons to Taiwan, and military officials still seem chilly toward the United States. The only discordant note at the American-Chinese meetings, an official said, was a presentation by an officer of the People’s Liberation Army, in which he blamed Washington for everything that had gone wrong between the two countries and credited Beijing for everything that had gone right. American officials complained afterward to their Chinese hosts. To emphasize the importance the United States places on military exchanges, Mrs. Clinton brought along Adm. Robert F. Willard, the commander of the United States Pacific Command, who met with senior military officials and was introduced by Mrs. Clinton to PresidentHu Jintao. Mrs. Clinton also pushed hard to change China’s aloof posture on the Korean standoff. She spent many hours in meetings with Chinese leaders, going over the fine points of the South Korean report and brandishing other evidence of the North’s involvement. She showered public praise on President Lee to remind Beijing of South Korea’s economic heft and strategic importance. And she is trying to corral support from Russia, which has often influenced how China votes in the United Nations Security Council, where both countries hold vetoes. It is a formula that administration officials said they used with some success in overcoming China’s initial opposition to United Nations sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program. But as with Iran, the process is likely to be slow, grinding and prone to setbacks. The Iran resolution has taken months longer than the administration would have liked, and even now, China’s support is not a sure thing. Administration officials suggested Wednesday that it would make sense to wait for the Iran sanctions to be passed before introducing a resolution on North Korea, to avoid overloading the diplomatic circuits at the Security Council. The Chinese have not yet shown any readiness to accept that the North sank the ship. To the extent that they alluded  to the crisis at all, it was to appeal for calm. Given China’s reluctance to single out North Korea, officials said it was unrealistic to expect that Mrs. Clinton could break down their resistance in a couple of days. That is likely to take days or even weeks of talks. Meanwhile, the United States signaled that it stood firmly behind President Lee, a former business executive who has the difficult task of responding to North Korea’s attack without allowing the situation to spiral out of control. Mrs. Clinton described him several times as statesmanlike. “We will stand with you in this difficult hour, and we stand with you always,” Mrs. Clinton said during a four-hour stop in Seoul. Despite all the hurdles, South Korean officials seemed confident that they would be able to win broad international backing. “China and Russia, of course, will take time, I’m sure,” said the foreign minister, Yu Myung-hwan. “But they will not be able to deny the facts.”

Chinese leaders face two unpalatable options: mollify North Korea or join the U.N. Security Council in condemning it.

BEIJING — In the best of times, Chinese foreign affairs scholars here say, Beijing grits its teeth while playing best friend toKim Jong-il,North Korea’s ailing and erratic 68-year-old leader.South Korea’s charge last week that North Koreasank one of its warships, killing 46 crewmen, makes that role exponentially harder. With Secretary of StateHillary Rodham Clintonand about 200 other American officials here for high-level security and economic talks, Chinese leaders face two unpalatable options. One is to mollify North Korea, and risk undermining its efforts to convince the United States, South Korea and Japan thatChinais a stabilizing force in East Asia. The other is to join those nations and theUnited Nations Security Councilin condemning North Korea for the attack, which North Korea denies, and risk a wholly unpredictable response from a volatile neighbor. So far, China has sought to straddle the two, saying only that both Koreas should show restraint in the midst of a brewing crisis. But Mrs. Clinton, who has publicly cited “overwhelming” evidence that North Korea torpedoed the South Korean corvette, theCheonan, is pressing Chinese officials to take an unequivocal stance. South Korea, which China has assiduously courted as a major trading partner and diplomatic friend, is making the same case. The sinking and its aftermath have reignited much the same debate that took place last year, after North Korea test-fired a long-range missile in April and conducted an underground nuclear test less than two months later. After balking at first, China eventually agreed to a unanimous Security Council resolution condemning the nuclear test and tightening existing sanctions. The United States, Japan and South Korea are uniting behind a similarly strong response this time. South Korea is expected to ask the Security Council on Monday to condemn the sinking of the 1,200-ton warship, which it says caused one of the largest losses of military personnel since the end of the Korean War. Mrs. Clinton is pushing Beijing to back the effort. “The North Koreans will be more easily dissuaded from further attacks like this if they don’t get cover from China, “ said Michael J. Green, an Asia specialist with the Center for International Studies in Washington. “So it’s absolutely critical to Korea and the United States that China send that signal.” But in discussions that began Sunday, China was resisting, and it has been skeptical of the claim that the North was responsible for sinking the ship. Scholars say such misgivings are typical when China is asked to side against North Korea. “There’s not much more that can be done to sanction North Korea,” said Shen Jiru, a strategic studies expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing. “China basically feels that sanctions or other tough measures only serve to escalate conflict with North Korea, and others tend to agree.” Still, a small but influential group of Chinese scholars insist that accommodating North Korea has not worked, and China needs to take a new and tougher tack. “The Chinese government so far has done too much to protect North Korea,” said Chu Shulong, a professor of international relations at Tsinghua University in Beijing. “Why should we protect them? Why should we treat them so specially? I think China needs to change its approach.” Wei Zhijiang, a visiting Chinese scholar at the University of Tokyo who specializes in North Korea, said that if China decides not to support a Security Council resolution, it should push for some other punishment. “Certainly North Korea must pay the price somehow,” he said. “Maybe apologize, pay compensation and promise this will not happen again.” China’s reluctance to censure the North is not rooted in affection for its policies. In private discussions, one American analyst said Sunday, Chinese officials express frustration with North Korea’s growing belligerence. But like their Washington counterparts, they say, they have no good option to deal with it. Officials here worry that more pressure on North Korea will prove counterproductive, and some recent history backs them: after China joined other nations last year in protesting the missile launch, Mr. Kim reacted by pulling out of the six-nation talks, chaired by China, aimed at endingNorth Korea’s nuclear weaponsprogram. This time, the North Korean government has threatened “all-out war” if it is punished for the Cheonan sinking. “China remembers this lesson,” said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. “I think this time our leaders are a little bit afraid of Kim Jong-il.” China’s other worry is strategic: if relations with the North sour because its leaders fear China is aligning with the West against it, China could face an unstable and now nuclear-armed adversary on its border. And if international pressure leads to the collapse of the North’s government and eventually a unified, democratic Korea allied with the United States, China’s power in the region would be weakened. A collapse could also unleash a flood of refugees across the Chinese border, a phenomenon China experienced in the mid-1990s when tens of thousands of North Koreans, if not more, fled widespread famine in their homeland. So Beijing has tried to support North Korea while gently edging it toward economic reform and nuclear disarmament. To keep the North’s government afloat, China provides food, fuel and, by some estimates, 90 percent of North Korea’s industrial goods. It also continues to invest there, positioning itself, some analysts say, for a post-Kim Jong-il period. In recent years, China has bought rights to  several North Koreancoaland mineral mines. In February, China and North Korea announced a deal to build a four-lane bridge across the Yalu River that marks the border. North Korea also recently agreed to lease its Rajin Port, giving inland northeast China long-sought access to the Sea of Japan. Yet despite North Korea’s growing dependence on China, officials in Beijing complain that they have very little leverage over Mr. Kim’s behavior. Mr. Wei, the China scholar at Tokyo University, said China considered it a victory when Mr. Kim agreed this month in Beijing to more communication and cooperation with China on regional and international issues. The past few weeks have shown just how awkward it can be for China to walk the line between courting the South and propping up the North. On April 27, as his nation’sforensicinvestigation drew to a close, President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea flew to Shanghai to try to persuade President Hu Jintao of China that North Korea had sunk the Cheonan and should be rebuked. The following week, President Huhosted the reclusive Mr. Kimin Beijing. Some Chinese scholars said the visit, Mr. Kim’s first to China in four years, showed their government’s desire to keep trying to push the North in the right direction. But South Koreans saw it as a slap in the face to their president — who one analyst said had asked President Hu to postpone or cancel the visit — and a reassuring nod to North Korea at precisely the wrong time. This weekend, perhaps as a conciliatory gesture, China announced that Prime Minister Wen Jiabao would travel to Seoul, the South Korean capital, at the end of the month.

China is facing pressure to rein in North Korea, an ally, since an international investigative team blamed North Korea for sinking a South Korean warship.

SEOUL, South Korea — Prime MinisterWen JiabaoofChinaoffered condolences on Saturday toSouth Koreafor the sinking of one of its warships in March, The Associated Press reported. China has faced growing pressure to rein inNorth Korea, its traditional ally, since an international investigative team placed blame for the warship’s sinking, and the death of 46 sailors, on a North Korean torpedo. South Korea is pushing for the United Nations Security Council to censure the North. Mr. Wen has joined the leaders of South Korea and Japan in a three-way summit on the southern Korean island of Jeju. “I hope this summit will conclude with solid results and that we will try together to ensure that it will contribute to world peace,” Mr. Wen said, according to a Korean-language transcript released by the South Korean president’s office and reported by the A.P. On Friday, the Chinese prime minister had promised that Beijing “will not protect anyone” once it had concluded who was responsible for the sinking. Mr. Wen had told the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, that China would make an “impartial judgment” on who was responsible for the sinking, said Mr. Lee’s spokesman, Lee Dong-kwan. “Once we have our conclusion, we will not protect anyone,” Mr. Wen was quoted by the spokesman as saying, words that seemed to represent a shift away from China’s former calls for calm on all sides. In its report on the talks in Seoul, China’s official Xinhua news agency made no mention of Mr. Wen’s pledge, but it did quote him as saying that China would assess the matter in an “objective and fair manner.” During the meeting, Mr. Lee made a detailed case as to why China should join international condemnation of North Korea, his aides said. Mr. Wen is trying to balance China’s inclination to shield North Korea from further sanctions against the expectations of South Korea and Japan, its third and fourth largest trading partners, that Beijing will be a force for regional stability. On Friday, Japan said it would limit cash remittances to North Korea from Koreans in Japan. South Korean officials have said they do not expect Beijing to rebuke the North at the Security Council, where South Korea, with American and Japanese support, will seek condemnation of the North next month. South Korea is not seeking the imposition of new sanctions but wants to secure broad agreement, particularly with China, on the “will and intention to continue and deepen the existing sanctions,” a senior government official told foreign correspondents in Seoul on Friday. Young technocrats in Beijing have begun to have “a new thinking” about China’s ties with North Korea, the official said. But “at the top level,” the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity, “I don’t see any serious change.” “There are only a few top-ranking old people who can decide China’s North Korea policy,” he said. “That’s the reality.” Ever since investigators concluded last week that a North Korean submarine torpedoed the 1,200-tonCheonanwarship, international attention has focused on Beijing. Without the support of China, the North’s biggest trading partner and benefactor, any campaign to formally punish the North is likely to fizzle. So far, China has not formally endorsed the investigative report. North Korea has denied responsibility for sinking the Cheonan and has warned that any retaliation or punishment could lead to war. On Friday, the National Defense Commission, the North’s highest ruling agency, headed by the country’s leader, Kim Jong-il, issued a rebuttal of the major points on the investigative report, which it called a “fake.” North Korea does not own a 130-ton minisubmarine of the sort the South said was used to attack the warship, Maj. Gen. Pak Rim-su, a commission official, said at a news conference in the North’s capital, Pyongyang, according to the North’s official news agency, K.C.N.A. Nor did the North distribute brochures containing the specifications of its torpedoes to foreign clients, he said. The South Korean Defense Ministry cited such brochures in support of its report. General Pak repeated the North’s warning that the Korean Peninsula was heading to “the brink of war.” Mr. Wen was the first Chinese leader to meet Mr. Lee since South Korea formally accused the North of torpedoing its ship. He will also meet Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama of Japan at the three-nation regional summit meeting on the resort island of Cheju over the weekend. Japan, which already bans trade with the North, said Friday that it would lower the limit on the amount of undeclared cash that could be carried to North Korea to 100,000 yen, or about $1,100, from the current 300,000 yen, or $3,300. The maximum amount that can be sent to North Korea without being reported to the Japanese government was lowered to $33,000 from $110,000.

North Korea’s strategic position The article “Why Korea remains a tinderbox” (May 31) raises the familiar argument that China keeps supporting North Korea because an internal collapse of that country would generate “a flood of millions of hungry refugees” moving north rather than south. As China relatively easily could seal the frontier (they have to look no further for ideas than the DMZ minefield and the West Bank and Mexican borders), a look at the map of the region suggests a different explanation. North Korea provides a convenient platform for distracting two important allies of the United States — South Korea and Japan. The platform gives the opportunity to operate China-controlled military bases with direct access to the Sea of Japan and an exit to the North Pacific Ocean. The east coast of Russia, touching North Korea, blocks otherwise that access. This scenario also explains, why the now defunct six-party talks offered so much hope. Jens A. Jorgensen, Brussels The Euro and European unity For the first time in the history of Europe its inhabitants have become one complete unit, with each part affected by the fortunes of the other. And yet attempts to bring about human unity through mechanical means and through political adjustments have proved abortive. It is not by these devices, not at any rate by them alone, that unity can be accomplished. The European spirit cannot find expression in mechanical formulas.

Five crew members of an aircraft carrying weapons from North Korea were denied bail here Monday and ordered held for at least 12 days while police investigate.

BANGKOK — Five crew members of an aircraft carrying weapons fromNorth Koreawere denied bail here on Monday and ordered held for at least 12 days while the police investigate the origin and destination of the mysterious shipment of arms. The crew members, who said they were unaware they were carrying weapons and thought the cargo was oil-drilling equipment, have not told investigators where the cargo was meant to be delivered, according to the police. “They have not confessed,” said Pongsapat Pongcharoen, a spokesman for the police. “They want to give all the information in court.” The five men could each face 10 years in prison on charges of possession of heavy weaponry, which North Korea is banned from exporting under a United Nations resolution passed this year. The plane landed at Bangkok’s military airport on Friday to refuel and was seized after a tip from the American authorities. Its final destination remains unclear. The crew said in an interview on Sunday that they were headed for Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates and then back to Ukraine, where they said their trip originated. But the Ukrainian Transportation Ministry said there was no record of the plane ever having been in Ukraine, and no information about a Ukrainian company having leased it. “There is no information confirming the lease of this aircraft,” said Oleksandr M. Kluban, a ministry spokesman. “There are no documents that show that this was a Ukrainian plane. We have nothing to do with this.” The seized cargo, totaling more than 30 tons, includes rocket-propelled grenades, surface-to-air missile launchers and possibly more sophisticated missiles. The weapons are due to undergo a further inspection beginning Tuesday. Four of the crew members carried passports from Kazakhstan, and the other had one from Belarus. Viktor Abdullayev, one of the pilots, said in an interview Monday that the crew was based in the former Soviet republic of Georgia. “I am from Kazakhstan,” he said, “but I work in Georgia.” The aircraft has changed hands at least twice this year in a tangled web of sales and leasing contacts that will complicate the investigation into who was ultimately responsible for the arms shipment. The crew member certificate of Mr. Abdullayev’s colleague Ilyas Issakov carries the flag of the former Soviet republic of Georgia and the logo of a company called Air West. Mr. Issakov is described as “captain” on the certificate Air West is an air freight company based in the Black Sea port city of Batumi, Georgia. Nodar Kakabadze, the head of the company, said in an interview that it had leased the plane a month ago to the Ukrainian affiliate of aThailand-based shipping company called SP Trading. “A month ago we handed over the plane and the crew to carry out some flights,” Mr. Kakabadze said. “They were supposed to carry out several flights from Ukraine, but the routes were not specified.” He said the five-man crew, which his company employed, would have had no idea what cargo they were carrying. “The crew will be released, because they have nothing to do with this,” he said “The crew is responsible for overseeing the plane and for loading and unloading.” Georgian officials said they had seen copies of the agreement, signed Nov. 5, leasing the plane to the Ukrainian affiliate. “There are these Soviet-made planes that Georgia got as a heritage from the Soviet Union,” said Shota Utiashvili, a top official in the Georgian Interior Ministry. “You cannot fly them for the transportation of civilians, so there are many companies who have leased them to foreign firms, which use them as they please.” The Kazakh Transportation Ministry said the plane was registered in Kazakhstan before it was sold to the Georgian company. “We checked through our channels: the plane belongs to Georgia but was earlier registered in Kazakhstan,” Radilbek Adimolda, the chairman of the ministry’s civil aviation committee, said at a press conference on Monday, according to Kazakhstan Today, a news agency. While aircraft tail numbers are codified by country under international agreements, aviation experts said that aircraft, much like seagoing cargo ships do not necessarily operate from their country of registry. Aircraft leasing and brokering arrangements through intermediaries further complicate matters. Flightglobal, an aviation Web site, said Monday that an airline called Air West is linked to Sun Air, a privately owned Sudanese airline with headquarters in the capital, Khartoum. Another Web site, Aviation Herald, also reported last year — in an account of the hijacking of a Sun Air plane to Libya — that Sun Air and Air West were the same airline. Siva Govindasamy, a Flightglobal analyst, said Monday that the weapons might have been bound for Sudan. “It is all still a mystery,” Mr. Govindasamy said, “but the indications certainly point to Sudan as a possible destination.” Under Thai law the police can hold the crew for up to 84 days before they are formally charged. The crew was sent to the same prison in Bangkok where Viktor Bout, a Russian businessman accused of global arms trafficking, is being held. He is awaiting an appeal of an extradition request by the United States.

In a wide-ranging speech on nuclear nonproliferation, the secretary of state hinted at broad changes in Washington’s thinking about its nuclear arsenal.
==::==
2009-10-22T00:00:00Z
==::==
WASHINGTON — Secretary of StateHillary Rodham Clintontook a tough approach on Wednesday on several proliferation issues, saying thatIranandNorth Koreamust take decisive action to curb their nuclear programs, and not just talk about doing so, if they expected to enjoy an easing of global pressures. She also foreshadowed the results of a review being conducted by the Pentagon,  which she said would produce a “transformational document” on the role, size and composition of the United States’ nuclear stockpile. Mrs. Clinton hinted at broad changes in thinking since the last review in 2001. “Now is the time for fresh views on the role of the U.S.nuclear weaponsarsenal,” she said. “We can’t afford to continue relying on recycled cold-war thinking.” Her comments seemed calculated to shield President Obama from criticism by some in Congress who contend that his call  for deep reductions in nuclear stockpiles could jeopardize the country’s defenses. “We must do more than reduce the numbers of our nuclear weapons,” she said. “We must also reduce the role they play in our security.” In her  speech on the administration’s nonproliferation efforts, an address the State Department had billed as particularly important, Mrs. Clinton sought to impart a sense of urgency. “Unless we act decisively and act now, the situation may deteriorate catastrophically and irreversibly,” she said in the speech,  delivered tothe United States Institute of Peace, a government-financed research center, on the occasion of its 25th anniversary. Her remarks on Iran were particularly timely. Earlier in the day, during  talks in Vienna,Tehran tentatively agreedto ship much of its stockpile of enriched uranium to Russia. She welcomed the offer as “a constructive beginning” but cautioned that the United States would not put up with any Iranian tactics  that seemed  intended to buy time. Similarly, while welcoming North Korea’s return to six-nation talks about dismantling the country’s nuclear program, Mrs. Clinton said that any improvement of relations would depend on credible actions by the North Koreans. No normalization of ties was possible with a nuclear North Korea, she said.

North Korea and Iran are about to become two radically different experiments in how American “engagement” works or fails to work.
==::==
2009-06-17T00:00:00Z
==::==
Ever since they settled into the Situation Room and began to plot strategies for their first encounters withNorth KoreaandIran,President Obama’s aides have described the two countries as polar opposites, unified only by a common desire fornuclear weapons. Now the two countries are about to become two radically different experiments in how “engagement” works or fails to work, as the new president takes a dramatically more confrontational approach with Pyongyang on the high seas, and tries to navigate the tricky politics of exploiting the anger on the streets of Tehran. President Bush famously lumped North Korea and Iran together as two-thirds of the Axis of Evil, a post-9/11 sound bite that obfuscated, in the minds of many, the very different challenges they pose. After examining what went wrong in the Bush years, when North Korea harvested most of the plutonium for its small arsenal, and Iran sped ahead to build the capability to make its own nuclear fuel, Mr. Obama and his aides are now designing different strategies for the two countries that are based on radically different assessments of their motivations. In the Obama analysis, the North is receding into what the president’s top strategists have repeatedly called a “defensive crouch,” trying to stave off the world with a barrage of missile and nuclear tests while the country’s leadership tries to sort out a survival strategy. Constantly on the brink of starvation, its military so broke that it cannot train its pilots, it has no illusions about becoming a great power in Asia. Its main goal is survival  —  and exploiting the money-making opportunities that come from arms exports. In contrast, Iran looked to the Obama team as a far more dynamic, open society eager to restore its traditional role as one of the great powers  —  if not the greatest  —  in the Middle East. To the country’s leadership, and to many of the reformers as well, the nuclear program is all about bolstering its chances at restoration. Unlike North Korea, Iran may not need a fully tested nuclear weapon. It just needs to create the perception that, with a few twists of the screwdriver, it is capable of turning a peaceful nuclear infrastructure into a weapons program, in a matter of months. The perception may be as powerful as the bomb. “Nuclear weapons capability would surely add to Iran’s ability to twist arms in the region,” Dennis Ross, the administration’s chief Iran strategist, wrote with David Makovsky in their new book about the Middle East, “Myths, Illusions, and Peace,”  published just as Iranians went to the polls last week in the now-disputed election. The book, completed before Mr. Ross was hired by the administration, is causing considerable heartburn in the White House, because it lays out a step-by-step recipe for what the authors call the “hybrid option” — combining diplomatic initiatives with excruciating economic pressure on the most vulnerable elements of Iran’s oil sector, whose output is declining. But re-analyzing the problem is easier than designing workable strategies to reverse what may now be irreversible. American presidents have been certain they could contain North Korea, or perhaps speed its collapse, since the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953. That was the same year that the C.I.A. organized a coup that deposed Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq and installed the Shah  —  a cold war operation for which Mr. Obama just publicly apologized during his speech at Cairo University last month. Very little has broken Washington’s way in either country in the ensuing 56 years. So is there any reason to believe that Mr. Obama’s new approaches will change the dynamic with either country? Maybe, but there are huge risks ahead. The decision to confront North Korea with overwhelming pressure  —  designed to bring its shipping and financial transactions to a virtual standstill  —  is based on the conclusion that re-entering negotiations to buy the dismantlement of the country’s main nuclear facility at Yongbyon is a futile strategy. It has already failed twice, once for President Clinton, once for President Bush. When Robert M. Gates, the defense secretary, said “I’m tired of buying the same horse twice,” he was signaling that the administration would not offer fuel, food or security guarantees in return for incremental steps to take apart the reactors and plutonium reprocessing facilities inside the high walls at Yongbyon. It may not be a problem; North Korea says it is never coming back to the talks. Maybe it will, maybe it won’t. But until then, Mr. Obama’s “engagement” strategy is more about overwhelming pressure than diplomacy. By hailing and seeking to inspect suspect North Korean ships in the Sea of Japan, and then pressing nations around the world to pick apart the ship’s cargo once they pull into ports for refueling, Mr. Obama is seeking to bring to a grinding halt the last revenue-producing element of the North Korean economy. The risk is that, however carefully designed to avoid open confrontation, the North Koreans will lash out  — perhaps opening fire on American, Japanese or South Korean ships, creating an incident that could quickly escalate. “Right now, our biggest worry is the North Korean captain who does something very, very stupid,” a senior military officer in the Pacific Command said Monday. “And when you intercept ships and tell them to stop, the risk is that someone can’t control their adrenaline. Then we can find ourselves back in the old days.” In Iran, in contrast, the administration’s approach is likely to be far more about diplomacy in the next few months than about pressure. Mr. Obama’s aides are clearly seeking to stand back and watch while protestors take to the streets shouting slogans against the country’s ruling elite. The White House fears that if the president speaks too supportively of the protestors, it will give PresidentMahmoud Ahmadinejadthe chance he is looking for to portray the angry crowds as American stooges. After all, in Iran it does not take much to stoke memories of the Mossadeq fiasco. It is too early to know whether these protests, which no one predicted, will gain steam or, like the uprising 20 years ago this month in Tiananmen Square, simply burn out. Mr. Obama’s conundrum is that he does not have the luxury of time. International nuclear inspectors describe a nuclear program that is speeding up  — moving the country very close to the nuclear capability that the United States, Israel and Iran’s Arab neighbors say they cannot abide. Yet if the new administration moves too quickly in executing the strategy of “engagement with pressure”  — what Mr. Ross and Mr. Makovsky describe in their book as showing the mullahs that “Iran’s economic lifeline is going to be cut and the oil revenues are going to dry up”  — it could quickly turn those young Iranians in the streets against Washington. And as one of Mr. Obama’s strategists put it the other day, hearing those protestors shout down the clerics “sounds a lot better to my ears than ‘Death to America!’ ”

How the United States can counter the threat of ballistic missile attacks from Iran without offending Russia.
==::==
2009-03-12T00:00:00Z
==::==
Cambridge, Mass. IN his recent letter to President Dmitri Medvedev of Russia, President Obama offered to modify the previous administration’s plans for a missile defense system in Europe. He was right to do so. A continued impasse with Russia might have prevented future arms reductions, created divisions with our European allies, done irreparable harm at the 2010 review of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and impaired efforts to deal with Iran’s growing potential to become a nuclear weapons state. President Obama has correctly shown skepticism about  the  missile defense system promoted by the Bush administration: its performance is  unproven, it requires unending additional resources and it faces problems that cannot be solved with existing science. Russia, for its part, has long perceived missile defense as a threat to its security — a concern the administration chose to ignore, worsening  tensions with Moscow. Fortunately, there is a “designer” missile defense that would answer President Obama’s hesitations and allay Russia’s fears. And unlike the Bush missile defense, it would actually be able to deal with the threat of ballistic missile attacks from North Korea and Iran if such a threat ever emerged. This is a proposal I’ve developed and analyzed with a variety of American and Russian experts and the idea itself is simple. The defense system would shoot down Iranian or North Korean long-range missiles as they slowly accelerate from their launching sites. It would take advantage of the fact that long-range missiles built by Iran or North Korea would be large and cumbersome, have long powered flight times and could take off only from well-known launching sites. The defense would have fast-accelerating interceptors that could home in on and destroy the large, slow and fragile ICBMs. The interceptors would weigh about a ton and could achieve a top speed of five kilometers per second in tens of seconds. They would be carried by stealthy unmanned airborne vehicles that look like B-2 bombers, but are smaller and carry much smaller, though still substantial, payloads. Such vehicles already exist. Only two of these armed drones, controlled by remote teams of operators, would be needed to patrol within several hundred kilometers of a launching site. At these ranges, it would be possible to shoot down an ICBM, with its nuclear warhead, so that the debris falls on the territory of the country that launched it. Only five drones would be needed to maintain a continuous patrol for extended periods. But the system would have to operate only when satellites and reconnaissance aircraft indicate that an ICBM is being prepared at the launching site. Unlike the provocative, unworkable defense planned by the Bush administration — with its two radars of insufficient range in the Czech Republic and Southern Europe and its 10  interceptors in Poland — this alternative defense would be technologically feasible, and could be developed, built and deployed near the areas of concern in a relatively short time. And it would be effective almost immediately on deployment. This system would provide an extremely intimidating and highly effective defense against Iran and North Korea, but would pose no threat to Russia or China. Their missiles are far too numerous and dispersed over such large areas that the defense would have little or no chance to engage them. In addition, pieces of it could even be  developed and operated in tandem with Russia. A specialized and focused missile defense of this type could also be forged into an international tool  to rid the world of nuclear weapons. It could, for instance, be used by the United Nations Security Council to extend the internationally accepted concept of “no flight zones” to include launching areas for long-range ballistic missiles. The Obama administration should study and consider this concept as a serious alternative to the dangerous and senseless path we have been on.

Washington rethinks how Pakistan and North Korea might lose control of nukes.
==::==
2008-09-14T00:00:00Z
==::==
WASHINGTON — Last week, when the news filtered out of the black hole of North Korea thatKim Jong-illikely suffered a stroke in August, no one in the Bush administration rushed out to buy a get-well-soon card. This is, after all, a man President Bush has described as a “tyrant,” a dictator who starves his own people, and, according to some Senators, a “pygmy” — the biggest insult for a guy who keeps a lot of elevator shoes in the presidential closet in Pyongyang. But whatever names he is called, there was a  surprising ambivalence in official Washington about the news — more than a whiff of reluctance, in fact, to lose Mr. Kim at the helm just now. This was true especially among intelligence officials,  who wake up every day worried about what happens when states implode, and whether there will be  a free-for-all for their weapons. Such  shudders have not been limited to the Hermit Kingdom this summer. They were also felt about Pakistan even before its president,Pervez Musharraf, resigned in mid-August rather than face impeachment. Knowing Mr. Musharraf was on thin ice, the United States government had already run “tabletop exercises” in which a Pakistani descent into chaos would leave everyone wondering who was in control of that country’s  nuclear arsenal. Would it be the new elected prime minister, whom the military deeply distrusts? The army? The small clique of trusted Musharraf aides who built the country’s nuclear security system, but no longer have a patron? In fact, the worries about these two unsteady nuclear powers have  begun to change thinking among officials in Washington  who used to focus principally on the awful scenario that a nuclear weapon might pass straight from a government to a terrorist group. Now, seven years after the post-9/11 panic, when a C.I.A. agent known as  Dragonfire erroneously reported that Al Qaeda had hidden a nuclear weapon in New York, the worry is being broadened  — to a new focus on whose hands control the nukeswithina government, especially at a time of great confusion. It is not that anyone is more sanguine about the possibility of a terror group acquiring  enough nuclear material to set off an atomic bomb in an American city. That is still the No. 1 worry.  But the way the problem is analyzed is  beginning to shift. “You know,” one senior intelligence official who would not speak on the record because he monitors the Pakistani arsenal said, “we used to have this great distinction between ‘states with nukes’ that we could deter the old-fashioned way, and ‘groups with nukes’ that we couldn’t deter.” But today, he said, “our biggest problem may be groups within states” that  could  take advantage of political chaos to seize what they need, either to sell it or to win a struggle for  leadership of the country. Oh, for the simple days of President Bush’s formulation of “with us or against us.” Before he came up with alternative rationales for the Iraq war, President Bush often said that the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks  had changed his view of tolerable risk, and he insisted that the possibility, no matter how slim, that Saddam Hussein would obtain or sell a weapon was unacceptable. Yet to experts in his own administration, what’s happening today in countries like North Korea and Pakistan poses a far higher statistical risk of letting loose nukes out the door than  Iraq ever did. (For one thing, there is no question that they have the nuclear material.) The president himself has been silent about this problem, but his spokesmen and the Pentagon’s have a stock answer to questions about it. It boils down to this: There is little reason to worry as long as the military remains in charge. Their reason: While North Korea and Pakistan have little else in common, they  both have strong militaries with a well-honed sensibility about survival. “It is very difficult for me to imagine someone arriving at a North Korean facility with guns blazing and emerging with a nuclear weapon,” said Matthew Bunn, who teaches at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government and is the author of an annual survey titled “Securing the Bomb.” “And the military understands that there is a big chance of retaliation if they ever sold anything to a terrorist  — retaliation that would remove them and everyone they ever met from power.” That is why the American bomb-watching community has a grudging fondness for Mr. Kim, the “pygmy dictator.” The Americans’ biggest fear about North Korea is a collapse of the state, in which a starving, broke nation simply implodes. That could send everyone on a mad scramble for the country’s arsenal  — the Chinese, the South Koreans, the Russians, the Americans. “The bad news about North Korea,” said Jonathan Pollack, a North Korea expert at  the Naval War College, “is that we don’t know much about their nuclear control system. Or even if they have much of one.” The good news is that the arsenal is small. In recent negotiations with the United States, before Mr. Kim fell ill, the country said it possessed  about 82 pounds of bomb-grade plutonium. If they are not lying (a significant “if’”)  that’s about enough to make six weapons. Some in the C.I.A. think the North Koreans  could have 12 or more weapons. It’s nothing to sneeze at, but compared to Pakistan’s arsenal, it’s a manageable number. Pakistan  has a sophisticated Nuclear Command Authority, with layers upon layers of protections, some of them installed with the help of a covert American program that has already spent more than  $100 million. Its leaders are  acolytes of Mr. Musharraf, but they are thought to be military professionals first, and therefore responsible. But unified leadership at the top still counts. The problem is that Pakistan has a great deal of  nuclear material, and  is making more at a  quick pace. Its facilities are spread out, so that India could not easily attack them all. The  intelligence service, the I.S.I., has deeply divided sympathies, with many supporting the Taliban and extremist causes. And the bulk of the military isn’t much better. “So when a Pakistani facility gets attacked,” asks Mr. Bunn, “what do the guards do? Do they fight? Do they help? Do they run away?” Recent history is not especially reassuring about either Pakistan or North Korea, considering how much technology has already leaked from them to other states.   Pakistan’s  laboratories were where Abdul Qadeer Khan started his nuclear proliferation ring and flourished during political upheaval in the 1990s.  Dr. Khan has been under  house arrest, but in recent months he  has been allowed to move around much more freely. And when the Israelis bombed a nuclear reactor in Syria a year ago, it soon came out that they had a lot of design and building help  — from the North Koreans. That was when Mr. Kim had his full faculties.  The nightmare is how much worse the leakage could get if it is unclear who is in charge.

Banking authorities in the United States and Macao began transferring millions of dollars to North Korea to end a dispute that has stalled an agreement to dismantle the North’s nuclear programs, Macao government officials said. The money was transferred from Banco Delta Asia, a small family-owned bank in Macao, in the first step to return the money to the original account holders, the officials said. Under pressure from the United States, the Macao government in September 2005 ordered that about $25 million belonging to either North Korean state agencies or businesses with links to North Korea be frozen in the Macao bank. Diplomats working on putting into effect the agreement reached in February among North Korea, the United States, China, Japan, Russia and South Korea hope the transfer will at last revive stalled attempts to get the North to shut its nuclear facilities.

To the Editor: Re “With Korea as Model, Bush Team Ponders Long Support Role in Iraq” (news analysis, front page, June 3): The strategic mission of the Korean occupation was to draw a line at the 38th parallel and prevent a North Korean attack on the South. In Iraq, the “38th parallel” is everywhere and nowhere; our troops will continue to be fruitlessly enmeshed in tribal and sectarian violence. For all of its problems, the United States military presence in Northeast Asia was a stabilizing force. The American occupation of Iraq, in contrast, has further destabilized the Middle East. It has created an enormous refugee crisis, enhanced Iranian regional power and encouraged Islamic radicalism. Finally, the Bush administration’s determination to build permanent military installations throughout Iraq in spite of the opposition of a majority of Iraqis to such a plan underlines the absurdity of the claim that we invaded Iraq to establish democracy there. Melissa MacauleyEvanston, Ill., June 3, 2007The writer is an associate professor of history and Asian and Middle Eastern studies at Northwestern University. • To the Editor: Since no two wars are alike, trolling through history for an Iraq disengagement model is fruitless. In Korea, a joint United States-United Nations force repulsed a Communist incursion and left behind a mutually agreed token force as guarantee. In Iraq, the people are on record as wanting the United States to leave, even if not just yet. A long-term United States force presence in the Middle East would be continuously destabilizing and present a continuing target for jihadists. History surely warns us about maintaining foreign garrisons in alien lands. Norman GetsingerFlint Hill, Va., June 3, 2007 • To the Editor: Let me get this straight. First, the United States incurs the ire of Osama bin Laden and other Islamic jihadists through its military actions in the Persian Gulf and by stationing forces in Saudi Arabia and other Muslim countries. Then, after being attacked by Al Qaeda, the United States invades and occupies a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, turning it into a haven for insurgents and terrorists. And now, the Bush administration wants to establish a long-term military presence in Iraq to make sure that Al Qaeda and other jihadist groups do not turn it into a base like Afghanistan? John S. DuffieldDecatur, Ga., June 3, 2007 • To the Editor: Re “Iraq’s Curse: A Thirst for Final, Crushing Victory” (Week in Review, June 3): You write, “Shiites intend to dominate the country entirely, taking what they believe was stripped from them when their revered leader Hussein was murdered in the desert of seventh-century Mesopotamia.” People who can carry a grudge for 14 centuries are not likely to forget all about it in a few months at the request of an invading army. Whenever the United States leaves Iraq, whether in 2008, 2012 or in 14 centuries, Iraqi blood will flow in rivers until a new incarnation of Saddam Hussein emerges to rule with an iron hand. For all the blood, treasure and heartache, we will have accomplished absolutely nothing. Ralph AverillNew Preston, Conn., June 4, 2007 • To the Editor: How long after the fight shifts from Iraq do you think it will take to start in this country on our own soil? Any weakening or surrender of will in Iraq will mean certain attacks in the United States, which is already at risk — note the J.F.K. airport plot and others that have been recently uncovered. We are in a war for our survival against Islamic extremism. There are multiple fronts. Iraq is one of these fronts. May we all keep this in mind! Bob JackNorth Las Vegas, Nev., June 3, 2007

WASHINGTON, April 14 — The Ethiopian government has denied that it violated United Nations sanctions by carrying out a secret purchase earlier this year of military equipment fromNorth Korea. The Central Intelligence Agency reported in late January that an Ethiopian-flagged ship had left a North Korean port and that its cargo probably included tank parts and other military cargo, according to American officials. The purchase of tank parts would violate restrictions on dealings with North Korea imposed by theUnited Nations Security Councilin a resolution adopted in October. The Security Council acted less than a week after North Korea tested a nuclear device. The Bush administration decided not to pressEthiopiato reject the shipment, and the vessel was not inspected after it took  its cargo to a port in Djibouti for overland transport to Ethiopia. Some American officials said the shipment was most likely a Security Council violation. In a statement issued Friday, the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry acknowledged that it had received a cargo shipment from North Korea on Jan. 22, but asserted that it did not include prohibited items like tank parts. “This shipment contained spare parts for machinery and engineering equipment and raw material for the making of assorted ammunition for small arms,” the Ethiopian statement read. “The United States Embassy in Addis Ababa might have been aware of Ethiopia’s importation of the said cargo from North Korea. “However, the fact is that Ethiopia did not purchase arms or any other item covered by Resolution 1718 under the contractual agreements,” the statement read, referring to the Security Council measure. Ethiopia said the shipment was carried out under the terms of several contracts that were signed with North Korea in June and was paid for in advance. The State Department has declined to comment on the details of this episode. Ethiopia purchased $20 million worth of arms from North Korea in 2001, according to American estimates, and American officials say this pattern has continued. Ethiopia has an arsenal of Soviet T-55 tanks and other Soviet-style equipment. The United States has sought to persuade Ethiopia to wean itself from its longstanding reliance on North Korea for inexpensive Soviet-era military equipment. The United States has had close ties with Ethiopia. American officials say that Ethiopia was provided with American intelligence about the location of Islamist forces before its recent offensive in neighboring Somalia. On Jan. 7, American AC-130 gunships launched two strikes on terrorist targets from an airstrip inside Ethiopia, according to American officials. Ethiopia has said such reports are a fabrication.

WASHINGTON, April 7 — Three months after the United States successfully pressed theUnited Nationsto impose strict sanctions onNorth Koreabecause of the country’s nuclear test, Bush administration officials allowedEthiopiato complete a secret arms purchase from the North, in what appears to be a violation of the restrictions, according to senior American officials. The United States allowed the arms delivery to go through in January in part because Ethiopia was in the midst of a military offensive against Islamic militias inside Somalia, a campaign that aided the American policy of combating religious extremists in the Horn of Africa. American officials said that they were still encouraging Ethiopia to wean itself from its longstanding reliance on North Korea for cheap Soviet-era military equipment to supply its armed forces and that Ethiopian officials appeared receptive. But the arms deal is an example of the compromises that result from the clash of two foreign policy absolutes: the Bush administration’s commitment to fighting Islamic radicalism and its effort to starve the North Korean government of money it could use to build up its nuclear weapons program. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, as the administration has made counterterrorism its top foreign policy concern, the White House has sometimes shown a willingness to tolerate misconduct by allies that it might otherwise criticize, like human rights violations in Central Asia and antidemocratic crackdowns in a number of Arab nations. It is also not the first time that the Bush administration has made an exception for allies in their dealings with North Korea. In 2002,  Spain intercepted a ship carrying Scud missiles from North Korea to Yemen. At the time, Yemen was working with the United States to hunt members of Al Qaeda operating within its borders, and after its government protested, the United States asked that the freighter be released. Yemen said at the time that it was the last shipment from an earlier missile purchase and would not be repeated. American officials from a number of agencies described details of the Ethiopian episode on the condition of anonymity because they were discussing internal Bush administration deliberations. Several officials said they first learned that Ethiopia planned to receive a delivery of military cargo from North Korea when the country’s government alerted the American Embassy in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital, after the adoption on Oct. 14 of the United Nations Security Council measure imposing sanctions. “The Ethiopians came back to us and said, ‘Look, we know we need to transition to different customers, but we just can’t do that overnight,’ ” said one American official, who added that the issue had been handled properly. “They pledged to work with us at the most senior levels.” American intelligence agencies reported in late January  that an Ethiopian cargo ship that was probably carrying tank parts and other military equipment had left a North Korean port. The  value of the shipment is unclear, but Ethiopia purchased $20 million  worth of arms from North Korea in 2001, according to American estimates, a  pattern that officials said had continued. The United States gives Ethiopia millions of dollars of foreign aid and some nonlethal military equipment. After a brief debate in Washington, the decision was made not to block the arms deal and to press Ethiopia not to make future purchases. John R. Bolton, who helped to push the resolution imposing sanctions on North Korea through the Security Council in October, before stepping down as United Nations ambassador, said that the Ethiopians had long known that Washington was concerned about their arms purchases from North Korea and that the Bush administration should not have tolerated the January shipment. “To make it clear to everyone how strongly we feel on this issue we should have gone to the Ethiopians and said they should send it back,” said Mr. Bolton, who added  that he had been  unaware of the deal before being contacted for this article. “I know they have been helpful in Somalia, but there is a nuclear weapons program in North Korea that is unhelpful for everybody worldwide. “Never underestimate the strength of ‘clientitis’ at the State Department,” said Mr. Bolton, using Washington jargon for a situation in which State Department officials are deemed to be overly sympathetic to the countries they conduct diplomacy with. Sean McCormack, the State Department spokesman, declined to comment on the specifics of the arms shipment but said the United States was “deeply committed to upholding and enforcing U.N. Security Council resolutions.” Repeated efforts to contact the Ethiopian Embassy were unsuccessful. In other cases, the United States has been strict in enforcing the Security Council resolution. For instance, late last year, American intelligence agencies tracked a North Korean freighter suspected of carrying illicit weapons and pressed several nations to refuse to allow the ship to dock. Myanmar, formerly Burma,  allowed it to anchor and insisted that there was  no violation. North Korea conducted its first nuclear test on Oct. 9, and the Security Council resolution, adopted less than a week later, was hailed by President Bush as “swift and tough,” and a “clear message to the leader of North Korea regarding his weapons programs.” Among the biggest sticking points during the negotiations over the resolution were Chinese and Russian objections to language requiring inspections of ships leaving North Korea. The United States repeatedly pressed China and Russia to agree to the inspections, saying they were essential to enforcing the resolution’s embargo on North Korea’s  sale of dangerous weapons, like ballistic missiles. In addition to the ban on the purchase of weapons from North Korea, the resolution also called for a ban on the sale of luxury goods to it and the freezing of its financial assets in banks worldwide. The measure had special relevance for several African states that have long purchased low-cost military equipment from North Korea. Ethiopia  has an arsenal of T-55 tanks that it acquired years ago from the Soviet Union and Eastern European nations. For years, it has turned to North Korea for tank parts and other equipment to keep its military running. The Ethiopians bought the equipment at a bargain price; the North Koreans received some badly needed cash. In 2005, the Bush administration told Ethiopia and other African nations that it wanted them to phase out their purchases from North Korea. But the Security Council resolution put an international imprimatur on the earlier American request, and the administration sought to reinforce the message. “They really are one of the larger conventional arms purchasers from North Korea, and we’re pressing them hard and saying, ‘Let’s get you out of that business,’ ” said the American official. Another American official, who is involved in Africa policy, said: “These are cash on the barrel transactions. The Ethiopians know that they can get the best deal in Pyongyang,” a reference to North Korea’s capital. In late January, the Central Intelligence Agency reported that  an Ethiopian-flagged vessel  had left a North Korean port and that its cargo probably included “tank parts,” among other military equipment. American officials said that the ship, the Tekeze, a modern vessel bought from a company in Montenegro and named after an Ethiopian river, unloaded its cargo in Djibouti, a former French colony where the United States has based Special Operations troops and other military forces. From there, the cargo was transported overland to Ethiopia. The Security Council resolution’s list of prohibited items included spare parts. Because the cargo was never inspected, some administration officials say the United States cannot say for certain that the shipment violated the resolution. It is not clear if the United States ever reported the arms shipment to the Security Council. But because the intelligence reports indicated that the cargo was likely to have included tank parts, some Pentagon officials described the shipment as an unambiguous Security Council violation. American officials said  the Ethiopians acknowledged that the ship was en route and said that they needed the  equipment to sustain their Soviet-era military. Ethiopia has a longstanding border dispute with Eritrea, but of more concern to Washington, Ethiopia was also focused on neighboring Somalia, where Islamic forces that had taken over Mogadishu, Somalia’s capital, six months earlier and were attacking Baidoa, the seat of a relatively powerless transitional government that was formed with the support of the United Nations. The timing of the shipment was extremely awkward, as the Ethiopian military was preoccupied with Somalia and also quietly cooperating with the United States. Ethiopia began an offensive in Somalia to drive back the Islamic forces and install the transitional government in Mogadishu late last year.  The United States was providing it with detailed intelligence about the locations  of the Islamic forces and  was positioning Navy ships off Somalia’s coast to capture fighters trying to escape the battlefield by sea. On Jan. 7, American AC-130 gunships launched two strikes on  terrorist targets from an airstrip inside Ethiopia, though it did not appear that the casualties included any of the few top  operatives of Al Qaeda  American officials  suspected were hiding in Somalia. After some internal debate, the Bush administration decided not to make an issue of the cargo ship. American officials insist that they are keeping up the pressure on Ethiopia. While Ethiopia has not provided an ironclad assurance that it will accept no more arms shipments from North Korea, it has told the United States that it will look for other weapons suppliers. “There was a lot going on at that particular moment in time,” said the senior American official. “They seem to have the readiness to do the right thing.”
