A memoir by a Korean-American author about teaching English to adolescent boys at a private university in Pyongyang was certain to anger the North Korean government. But the author,Suki Kim, may have provoked even more anger among the university’s Christian educators. They have denounced Ms. Kim for breaking a promise not to write anything about her experiences and said her memoir contains inaccuracies, notably her portrayal of them as missionaries, which could cause them trouble with the North Korean authorities. The private university, thePyongyang University of Science and Technology, was approved in 2001 by the North Korean authorities, despite their distrust of outsiders. Fenced and heavily guarded, the university opened eight years later. It was there that Ms. Kim secretly took notes as she taught English in 2011 to 50 teenage boys and young men drawn fromNorth Korea’s most privileged families. It is unclear whether the school will suffer any repercussions because of the book, “Without You, There Is No Us” (Crown Publishers), named for a lyric in an ode to the ruling Kim family, often sung by the students in their regimented routines. But the school’s president and founder, James Chin-Kyung Kim, said that because of the book, he had been sharply questioned by the North Korean authorities about Ms. Kim. The book, which has been acclaimed by some Western experts on North Korea, has added another irritant to the troubled relations between North Korea and the United States. A Korean-language version is planned for this spring. Ms. Kim, who is not a practicing Christian, conceded in an interview that she had been deceptive in applying for a teaching position at the school and clandestinely taking notes for the purpose of a book. Ms. Kim said she would furtively scribble memorable quotes and anecdotes, destroy any paper notes after transcribing them secretly onto her laptop, then copy the transcriptions to thumb drives and erase them from the laptop. She wore the thumb drives around her neck like pieces of jewelry, she said, or stashed them in the garbage can in her residence on campus. All faculty members, she said, were constantly monitored and North Korean officials subjected their belongings to occasional unannounced searches. She hid her intentions not only from colleagues but also from Dr. Kim, a Korean-American entrepreneur who also founded a similar school in northeast China. “I do feel really bad for hurting them,” she said. “Some of them were really nice, good, hardworking people.” However, Ms. Kim argued, her fellow teachers had another motive. “As much as they say they wanted to educate North Korean kids for no reason, and poured money — life’s savings — into this school, really the larger goal was to convert them, one day, if North Korea were to open up,” she said. “It’s a long-term project of turning them to Jesus, that’s really their larger goal.” Dr. Kim denied her allegations, saying that the school is committed to education, not proselytizing. Publication of the book has come as both proselytizing and human rights in North Korea are in the news. Two of the three Americans who were incarcerated in North Korea, and only recently released, had been accused of hostile acts by seeking to spread the Christian faith. And the North’s state media has reacted with outrage over the past few weeks to an American-backed resolution at the United Nations urging that North Korean leaders faceprosecution at the International Criminal Courtfor crimes against humanity. Ms. Kim, 44, immigrated to the United States with her family from South Korea when she was a child. A recipient of Fulbright and Guggenheim fellowships, she had her first book, “The Interpreter,” a novel about a Korean-American court interpreter in New York, published in 2003. She has been traveling to North Korea as a journalist since 2002. She said she had been drawn to teaching at the Pyongyang school partly because it offered an opportunity to get beyond what she called the superficial reporting that often comes out of North Korea. “I realized this was the only chance that I have of actually telling a longer story,” she said. Her most worrisome inner conflict, she said, was in causing inadvertent danger to her students, with whom she had established trusting relationships. She gave them pseudonyms and muddled their identities in the book, she said, so the North Korean authorities would not seek retribution by punishing them. Dr. Kim sent her what she described as a series of angry and distressed emails when he found out about her plans to publish the book. At least two of her former fellow teachers also wrote, imploring her to scrap the idea. In a telephone interview from China, Dr. Kim sought to rebut the entire book. “I am really upset about the attitude, her writings, her telling lies, her cheating us,” he said. He was especially critical of what he called the erroneous assertion that the other teachers were missionaries. “We are educators,” he said. If the North Korean authorities thought that the school was seeking to convert the students to Christianity, Dr. Kim said, “we would have trouble.” “They know we are Christian, we do not hide that,” he said. “But we are not missionaries. Christians and missionaries are different.” Ms. Kim acknowledged that the university’s Christians did not want to be called missionaries or proselytizers. “It’s far more subtle than that,” she said. “It’s why they call themselves educators. It’s another code word for what they’re doing.”

North Korea said its leader had ordered the release of Jeffrey E. Fowle, one of three Americans recently detained there, after requests from President Obama.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreasaid Wednesday that its leader,Kim Jong-un, had personally ordered the release of Jeffrey E. Fowle, an American, after considering requests from President Obama. Mr. Fowle, an Ohio municipal worker and one of three Americans detained inNorth Korea, had been held for nearly six months before a United States military plane picked him up Tuesday. He arrived Wednesday in Ohio, where he was reunited with his wife and three children, who rushed to greet his plane when he arrived at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton. Mr. Kim recently reappeared in state-run news media after a six-week absence, ending widespread speculation about his health and his grip on power. With the statement on Wednesday, North Korea appeared to be burnishing Mr. Kim’s image at home as a leader capable of doing a favor for the American president. Analysts also said the sudden release of Mr. Fowle might have been a conciliatory gesture from Mr. Kim to bolster his government’s efforts to engage Washington in a dialogue. The report was the North’s first public comment on the circumstances surrounding Mr. Fowle’s release. Washington has not offered an explanation, except for thanking the Swedish government, which maintains an embassy in Pyongyang and has represented the interests of Americans held in the North. The United States and North Korea remain technically at war after the Korean War was halted in 1953 in a truce. Mr. Fowle, 56, of Miamisburg, Ohio, was released while he was awaiting trial on charges of committing an antistate crime. He entered North Korea in late April on a tourist visa and was arrested in May after leaving a Bible behind. North Korea considers any attempt by an outsider to disseminate Christian messages a crime aimed at undermining its political system. The statement released by the family gave thanks to God “for his hand of protection over Jeff these past six months” and said that Mr. Fowle wanted people to know that the North Korean government had treated him well. The statement also said that although the family was “overjoyed” by his return, they were mindful that two other Americans, Kenneth Bae and Matthew Todd Miller, were still being held and understood “the disappointment their families are experiencing today that their loved ones did not return home with Jeff.” Mr. Fowle was present when a lawyer and family friend read the statement in front of his home, but he made no comment, only smiling when reporters asked how he was feeling. Few had anticipated his release. In early September, the North Korean government arranged American news media interviews with Mr. Fowle and the two other detained Americans in which they beseeched Washington to send a high-profile envoy to negotiate their freedom. But United States officials said Pyongyang had repeatedly rejected their offer to send a high-level representative. One of the Americans still in detention, Mr. Bae, was arrested in late 2012 and later sentenced to 15 years of hard labor on charges of trying to build an underground proselytizing network in a plot to overthrow the government. Last month, the North’s Supreme Court convicted the other American, Mr. Miller, on spying charges and sentenced him to six years of hard labor. North Korea later said that Mr. Miller, 25, of Bakersfield, Calif., had entered the country hoping to be arrested and become an eyewitness to prison life there. It said that Mr. Miller had torn up his tourist visa upon arriving in Pyongyang in April so that his unruly behavior could land him in a prison camp, where he hoped to collect evidence of human rights violations. The detention of the three Americans strained North Korea’s already rocky relations with the United States, which has been trying to isolate the country with the help of United Nations sanctions imposed for the North’s development and testing of nuclear weapons. Washington had accused Pyongyang of holding the Americans as “pawns” — human bargaining chips who could force the United States to make concessions, such as taking part in bilateral talks that the North has long sought. After Mr. Fowle’s release, the United States urged North Korea to free the remaining two Americans. Mr. Fowle’s release comes at a time when North Korea appears to be seeking a thaw in its relations with its neighbors after years of escalating tensions, marked by the nuclear and missile tests. A high-ranking delegation from the North made a surprise visit to South Korea this month and agreed to resume high-level inter-Korean dialogue, although the two Koreas later exchanged fire across their land and sea borders. North Korea has also agreed to investigate the fates of Japanese citizens allegedly kidnapped by its agents decades ago.

Matthew Todd Miller is accused of shredding his tourist visa and demanding asylum, which the North says is a &#8220;hostile act&#8221; against the country.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreasaid Sunday that it would put Matthew Todd Miller, one of the three Americans known to be held in the country, on trial in a week. Mr. Miller will be tried at the North’s Supreme Court next Sunday, the country’s state-run Korean Central News Agency said, indicating that his trial will be a one-day event with no appeals allowed. North Korea had earlier said Mr. Miller shredded his tourist visa and demanded asylum upon arriving in the country in April. Accusing him of unruly behavior, the North had said it would indict him on charges of committing a “hostile act” against the country. Another American, Jeffrey Edward Fowle, also faces trial for a “hostile act.” Last year, an American missionary, Kenneth Bae, was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor on charges of hatching a plot to overthrow the government through proselytizing. In separate interviews last Mondaywith CNNandThe Associated Press, the three Americans admitted to being guilty and beseeched the United States government to send a high-level envoy to negotiate their freedom. The United States has repeatedly offered to send its envoy for North Korean human rights issues, Robert R. King, to the North to appeal for the release of the Americans, but without acceptance. It has no diplomatic relations with North Korea, and relies on the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang, the North’s capital, to represent the interests of its citizens held there. North Korea previously used charges of “hostile acts” to sentence Americans to long prison terms as a means of securing visits from high-profile Americans, like former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter. Analysts said the North wanted to extract similar visits to undermine Washington’s effort to increasingly isolate the country because of its nuclear and ballistic missile activities. Washington has advised Americans against traveling to North Korea.

A scorching attack on Edward J. Snowden also cites unnamed accomplices in the disclosure of intelligence secrets.
==::==
2014-01-30T00:00:00Z
==::==
WASHINGTON —  The nation’s top intelligence official on Wednesday delivered a scorching attack on Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, and called on him and his “accomplices” to return the trove of classified documents he took from the N.S.A. James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, told lawmakers that Mr. Snowden’s disclosures had done grave damage to the country’s security and had led terrorist groups to change their behavior to elude American surveillance. Mr. Clapper did not give specific examples to bolster his assessment about the damage Mr. Snowden had done. He also did not say whom he believed Mr. Snowden’s accomplices to be. In his annual testimony to Congress about the threats facing the United States, Mr. Clapper, who in the past has said he resented having to testify in public about classified issues, ticked off a daunting list: cyberattacks from China, Iran, North Korea and Russia; the spread of affiliates of Al Qaeda; and an array of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons technologies. But in part because he and his colleagues are so wary of discussing classified issues in public, the hearing became as much a moment for speechmaking as for substance. Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who has been outspoken in his critique of the growth ofthe N.S.A.’s surveillance activities, said that the dealings between spy agencies and their congressional overseers were crippled by a “culture of misinformation.” Mr. Wyden has had a particularly contentious relationship with Mr. Clapper. During a hearing last year, he questioned Mr. Clapper aboutwhether intelligence agencies were collecting any bulk information about Americans. Mr. Clapper said they were not, but months later he had to apologize for that answer after Mr. Snowden revealed an N.S.A. program to collect and store domestic phone records. On Wednesday, Mr. Clapper — who appeared at the hearing with the heads of several intelligence agencies — railed against the flood of reports in the news media based on Mr. Snowden’s documents. He also accused Mr. Snowden of hypocrisy for choosing to live in Russia while making public pronouncements about “what an Orwellian state he thinks this country is.” In his written statement, Mr. Clapper listed threats from “trusted insiders” like Mr. Snowden, in addition to “threats posed by foreign intelligence entities,” as a greater concern even than international terrorism. A spokesman for Mr. Clapper, asked about the reference to Mr. Snowden’s accomplices, said, “Director Clapper was referring to anyone who is assisting Edward Snowden to further threaten our national security through the unauthorized disclosure of stolen documents related to lawful foreign intelligence collection programs.” Other lawmakers engaged in testy exchanges with John O. Brennan, the C.I.A. director, over avoluminous committee reportabout the agency’s detention and interrogation program, which is now defunct. The report was completed over a year ago but has yet to be declassified. On two occasions, Democratic senators tried to press Mr. Brennan for details about an internal C.I.A. review that they said contradicted the agency’s official response to the Intelligence Committee’s report. Both times, Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who leads the committee, cut off the questioning and said the matter would be discussed behind closed doors. Mr. Clapper ticked off a list of global focal points during his opening statement, saying that in his years as an intelligence official he had “not experienced a time when we have been more beset by crises around the globe.” He said that the turmoil across the Middle East in the aftermath of the collapse of authoritarian governments had created an opportunity for various franchises of Al Qaeda to flourish. He described Syria as the most powerful magnet for foreign fighters hoping to wage jihad, with about 7,000 foreigners having traveled to Syria from about 50 countries. For the second year in a row, Mr. Clapper listed cyberattacks as the most significant threat facing the United States. He said financial institutions, defense contractors and, potentially, electric grids, water utilities and even medical devices are under threat from cyberattackers. Mr. Clapper’s written testimony cited the threats from China, Iran, North Korea and Russia as the most pernicious. It also raised the alarm that they are copying the steps the United States took several years ago when it unified under one command the civilian task of code breaking and surveillance with military cyberoffensive operations. While the report noted a major attack on South Korea last year that destroyed data at a bank and media organizations, it stopped short of blaming North Korea for the attack. But Mr. Clapper was more specific about another aspect of North Korea’s abilities. In his written testimony, he said that the country had made good on threats to enlarge its supply of fuel for nuclear weapons, expanding the size of a uranium enrichment operation at its Yongbyon nuclear facility and restarting a mothballed reactor that can produce plutonium. South Korean officials and nonproliferation groups using satellite technology had reported these developments, but Mr. Clapper’s testimony represented further corroboration by American intelligence agencies.

How Dennis Rodman and Paddy Power came to know each other is connected to the online betting company’s acceptance of wagers on almost anything.
==::==
2013-12-20T00:00:00Z
==::==
The growing basketball collaboration between Dennis Rodman and Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, can be traced back to an Irish online betting company and the pope. Mr. Rodman, the former N.B.A. starwho arrived in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, on Thursdayto tutor North Korea’s best basketball players at Mr. Kim’s behest, is doing so under the sponsorship of Paddy Power, Europe’s leading Internet gambling business. The four-day trip comes aftera deadly purgeby Mr. Kim that has raised worries of a dangerous power struggle in the nuclear-armed and often unpredictable country. How Mr. Rodman and Paddy Power came to know each other is rooted in what gambling industry experts call the company’s culture of shrewd stunt marketing, offensive ads and the acceptance of wagers on almost anything, like the content of the final episode of “The Simpsons” or a president’s longevity in office. The relationship began in February, when Paddy Power took note of Mr. Rodman’s highly publicizedfirst visit to North Koreaand his declaration of friendship with Mr. Kim — just as company officials were strategizing to maximize betting profits on the successor to Pope Benedict XVI. They recruited Mr. Rodman to encourage betting on a black pope, riding him around Rome in an ersatz popemobile, as speculation intensified that the cardinals closeted in the Sistine Chapel might pick Peter Turkson of Ghana to be the Roman Catholic Church’s first African pope in modern times. “We had a money-back special. Your money back if the pope’s black,” Rory Scott, a Paddy Power spokesman, said in a telephone interview. So when Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina, a white cardinal now known as Francis, was chosen, Mr. Scott said jokingly, “Our prayers were answered.” During their pope collaboration, Mr. Scott said, Mr. Rodman and Paddy Power executives devised the idea of setting up an international basketball tournament involving North Korea’s national team. Months later, whenMr. Rodman visited Mr. Kim a second time, the North Korean leader, an avowed basketball enthusiast, embraced the idea. He said they should hold the tournament in Pyongyang on his 31st birthday, Jan. 8. “So it all started when the pope resigned,” Mr. Scott said, speaking from Beijing as he was preparing to accompany Mr. Rodman to Pyongyang. “That had everything to do with it.” Mr. Rodman’s publicist, Darren Prince of Prince Marketing Group of Los Angeles, did not return telephone calls or emails seeking comment about the trip, which comes as Mr. Kim, who leads one of the world’s most isolated and repressive governments, appears to be engaged in crushing political challenges to his supremacy. Mr. Kim’s uncle and onetime mentor, Jang Song-thaek, wasexecuted last weekafter an abruptly announced trial and conviction for sedition. In an interviewon Thursday in Pyongyang with The Associated Press, the only American news agency with a bureau there, Mr. Rodman reiterated that his plans had not changed and that the trip could ease the longstanding estrangement between the United States and North Korea, which never declared a formal end to the Korean War six decades ago. He said the trip was an opportunity for others to see “that this country is actually not as bad as people project it to be in the media.” Mr. Rodman has said previously that after he conducts the training, he will return in January with an unspecified number of former N.B.A. players for Mr. Kim’s birthday tournament, which Paddy Power officials are calling “the Big Bang in Pyongyang.” During Mr. Rodman’s first trip to North Korea, photos that quickly spread on the Internet showed him and Mr. Kim laughing together as they took in a basketball game. Mr. Rodman has proclaimed Mr. Kim “a friend for life” and “a very good guy.” Mr. Scott said Paddy Power was not taking wagers on the tournament, though he declined to discuss the commercial or financial aspects of the event. “We view this as a unique opportunity to put on a quite incredible historic event,” he said. “We view sport as a universal language.” State Department officials have repeatedly said Mr. Rodman does not represent the United States government and is carrying no messages on its behalf. But privately, diplomats and North Korea specialists say, there is considerable interest in Washington about Mr. Rodman’s trip, partly because so little is known about Mr. Kim, the grandson of Kim Il-sung, North Korea’s revolutionary founder. The trip and the Jan. 8 tournament also appear to have increased tourist interest in North Korea. Koryo Tours of Beijing, which specializes in trips to North Korea, even offered adeal on its websitefor a four-day excursion that included tickets to the tournament. “There will never be another trip quite like this one,” the offer states. “Anyone coming along with us will have a story to tell forever more.” Despite the price of almost $8,900, quadruple the cost of a regular tour of that duration the package sold out within days, said Hannah Barraclough, a Koryo tourism manager. Ms. Barraclough said Americans had not been dissuaded by their government’s warnings that citizens should avoid travel to North Korea because they could be subject to arbitrary arrest. Kenneth Bae, a 44-year-old American,has been incarcerated for more than a yearon charges of hostile acts because of his Christian missionary work. Merrill E. Newman, an 85-year-old Korean War veteran from California who was seized on Oct. 26 while on an official tour, was notreleased for a month. Mr. Newman’s wartime role included advising anti-Communist guerrillas, a group particularly reviled in the North. “It was awful what happened to him,” Ms. Barraclough said, referring to Mr. Newman, “but he went in not understanding that the Korean War was still going on. People were quite aware that it was an exceptional case.” The publicity over Mr. Rodman’s visit could give Paddy Power some name-brand recognition as it isseeking to expand into the United States, where Internet gambling, considered a $33 billion market worldwide, is illegal in most states. The company has applied for licenses in Nevada and New Jersey, which along with Delawarebegan allowing Internet gamblingthis year. The company is famous for offensive advertising and wagers on delicate political issues, some with racial overtones. In 2008 it was widely criticized for offering a bet that President Obama would not finish his first term, which critics said was an invitation for an assassination attempt — an accusation the company denied. It has been repeatedly criticized in Britain over television advertisements deemed inappropriate. Last year, London’s Daily Telegraphlisted Paddy Power’s most controversial ads, which include betting on the survival of two old women shown crossing a busy street, titled “Let’s make things more interesting,” and one showing Jesus and the apostles playing poker at the Last Supper. Jocelyn Wood, a reporter and editor forPokerfuse, a website about online poker news, said he would not be surprised if Paddy Power carried out “some form of ridiculous stunt” despite North Korea’s reputation for strictness. “They may sign a nonaggression pact with Kim, or stage a leprechaun fight with the North Korean mascot, or something similar,” he said in an email. “Think like Borat — they’ll be doing something along those lines.”

Kim Jong-un engineered recent reshuffles to retire or sideline old generals and promote a new set of aides more loyal to him.
==::==

==::==
SEOUL, South Korea —  State news media on Thursday confirmed the removal of a hard-line general as North Korea’s military chief, the latest sign of an overhaul by the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, who South Korean officials say has replaced nearly half of his top officials in the past two years. The firing of Gen. Kim Kyok-sik and the rise of Gen. Ri Yong-gil to replace him as head of the general staff of the North’s Korean People’s Army were the latest in a series of high-profile reshuffles that Mr. Kim has engineered in what is widely believed to be a bid to consolidate his grip on the North’s elites. Since taking power after the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, in 2011, the younger Mr. Kim has replaced 44 percent of North Korea’s 218 top military, party and government officials, the South’s Ministry of Unification said in a report. Analysts say he engineered this and other reshuffles to retire or sideline the generals who served his father and to promote a new set of aides who will owe their loyalty directly to him. Little is known about General Ri. He gained the attention of outside analysts when North Korean news media reported that he was one of the generals who advised Mr. Kim this spring during a time of high tension on the divided Korean Peninsula when the North threatened the United States and South Korea with nuclear strikes. Mr. Kim’s father and grandfather also made a practice of promoting, demoting and firing generals as a way of taming the country’s powerful military. South Korean analysts say they believe that Mr. Kim, while intent on expanding the country’s nuclear and missile abilities, wanted to dilute the military elite’s political and economic power, possibly as part of his stated push to revive the moribund economy. The military has long had strong control of many industries in the nation, but analysts say Mr. Kim appears to be giving the party and cabinet bigger roles in trying to resuscitate the economy. Early in his rule, he was reported to have stripped the military of its lucrative export rights for some minerals. As always, part of the analysts’ work is informed guesswork, since the North maintains rigid control of the information that flows in and out of the country. The reordering of top jobs has accelerated since July of last year, when Vice Marshal Ri Yong-ho, one of the most powerful men under Mr. Kim’s father, was suddenly fired as military chief. He was replaced by Vice Marshal Hyon Yong-chol. Mr. Hyon did not last long either; he was demoted and replaced by General Kim in May. General Kim, 74, had been one of the oldest aides of Kim Jong-il still holding a top job even after Kim Jong-un promoted younger generals. South Korean officials believed General Kim commanded units responsible for sinking one of South Korea’s warships and for shelling a South Korean border island in 2010. The two attacks killed 50 South Koreans. The general’s name disappeared from the North’s state news media after the Central Military Commission of the ruling Workers’ Party met in August to discuss personnel matters. South Korean officials concluded that General Ri was appointed military chief during the meeting. North Korean news media did not mention his new title until Thursday. General Ri joins Gen. Jang Jong-nam, who became minister of the armed forces in May, and Vice Marshal Choe Ryong-hae, the military’s top political officer, as Mr. Kim’s top military aides. Among the three, Vice Marshal Choe, director of the General Political Department of the North Korean People’s Army, was considered the most powerful. He has appeared with Mr. Kim in North Korean news media more often than any other member of the elite. A former party secretary, he had never served in the army, and South Korean analysts see his sudden rise in the military ranks under Mr. Kim as a sign that the North Korean leader is letting the party reassert its influence over the military as he vowed to channel more national resources into the rebuilding of the economy. Meanwhile, North Korean news media late Wednesday showed Mr. Kim inspecting a housing project together with his wife, Ri Sol-ju, who has been a focus of lurid gossip in the region in recent weeks. In August, the conservative daily Chosun Ilbo in South Korea reported that Mr. Kim had ordered the executions of a dozen North Korean performers, including the singer Hyon Song-wol — who the paper said was Mr. Kim’s former girlfriend — for making videos of themselves performing sex acts and then selling the recordings. Then, last month, the Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun reported claims that Mr. Kim had ordered the executions to prevent the spreading of rumors that his wife had engaged in similar acts when she was a singer. North Korea called the reports “an unpardonable hideous provocation hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership” and promised a “stern punishment.” Nam Jae-joon, director of South Korea’s National Intelligence Service, told lawmakers in Seoul that his agency was aware of the executions but that it could not confirm reports of Ms. Ri’s involvement.

Harsh weather in North Korea prevented a Navy pilot from retrieving the remains of a fellow airman killed 63 years ago in one of the fiercest battles of the Korean War.
==::==

==::==
BEIJING — As more than 100,000 Chinese soldiers swarmed over far fewer American Marines and soldiers in subzero temperatures on treacherous terrain in one of the fiercest battles of the Korean War, two United States Navy pilots took off from an aircraft carrier to provide cover for their comrades on the ground. One of the airmen, Ensign Jesse L. Brown, was the son of an African-American sharecropper from Mississippi. The other, Lt. Thomas J. Hudner Jr., was the son of a white patrician merchant family from Massachusetts. An hour into the flight, Ensign Brown’s plane was hit by enemy fire, forcing him to crash land on the side of a mountain at Chosin, north of Pyongyang. Lieutenant Hudner brought his plane down nearby and found Ensign Brown, but could not rescue him. On Monday, nearly 63 years after the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, Mr. Hudner, 88, arrived in Beijing after a 10-day visit to North Korea aimed at finding his friend’s remains. The trip to North Korea coincided with the 60th anniversary of the end of the Korean War, a milestone that the North Korean government has tried to use for propaganda purposes. Mr. Hudner’s trip was arranged by Chayon Kim, a Korean-American who organized the visit in February of Dennis Rodman, the former N.B.A. star who became the first American to meet with the North’s young leader, Kim Jong-un, since he took over from his father in 2011. The timing of Mr. Hudner’s visit coincided with a massive military parade on Saturday. Not wanting to be a North Korean prop and citing his frail legs, Mr. Hudner said he avoided the parade and stayed away from the opening of a military museum featuring the U.S.S. Pueblo, an American Navy ship captured by North Korea in 1968. Nonetheless, he said he made the trip to help bring closure not only to himself but to Mr. Brown’s widow, Daisy Brown Thorne, 88. In the end, though, his mission failed. It is the rainy season in the North, and the North Koreans told him that almost daily downpours had washed away roads and bridges and made access to the crash site, a five-hour drive from Pyongyang, impossible. “It was sort of a jolt to see how they were claiming this was a victory,” Mr. Hudner said, as he and his traveling companion, Dick Bonelli, 82, a Marine veteran from the battle of Chosin, relaxed at a hotel here before returning to the United States on Tuesday. “We decided not to go to the parade and to skip the museum and the U.S.S. Pueblo. It still belongs to the United States.” Mr. Hudner’s attempt to save Mr. Brown has resonated through American military annals not only for its daring, but because of what it said about race relations in the newly desegregated military. The two men met nearly two years after the official desegregation order. “Shortly after I joined the squadron, I was changing into flight gear and he came in and nodded ‘Hello,’ ” Mr. Hudner said of meeting Ensign Brown in December 1949. “I introduced myself, but he made no gesture to shake hands. I think he did not want to embarrass me and have me not shake his hand. I think I forced my hand into his.” Mr. Brown, the United States Navy’s first black aviator, had endured scorn and prejudice during training from 1947 to 1948, said Adam Makos, who is writing a book on the wartime friendship between the two pilots, and who also visited Pyongyang with Mr. Hudner. On the day of the fateful flight, Mr. Hudner said he took off with Mr. Brown on his wing on Dec. 4, 1950. They were in a formation of six Corsairs, single-propeller planes from World War II that are big enough only for a pilot and are mounted with .50-caliber machine guns. The pilots had been flying almost daily sorties, giving protection to American soldiers engaged in hand-to-hand combat with Chinese soldiers sent by Mao Zedong to fortify the weak North Korean Army. The Americans, surprised by the wave upon wave of Chinese soldiers, and hindered by machine guns that did not work in the freezing weather, had been ordered to withdraw. They were within days of completing that operation when Mr. Hudner and Mr. Brown flew with instructions to patrol roads for enemy troops. About an hour after takeoff, Mr. Hudner saw white vapor from Mr. Brown’s plane. “I pointed to a clearing on the mountain where Jesse could land,” Mr. Hudner said. “He landed with such force, we were convinced he perished. But we saw that Jesse opened the canopy of the cockpit, and we knew he was alive.” Mr. Hudner managed to land about 100 yards from Mr. Brown. Two feet of snow covered the ground, the temperature was around zero, and they were behind enemy lines. “Jesse saw me coming and said in a calm voice: ‘Tom, we’ve got to figure a way of getting out of here.” The downed pilot had taken off his gloves, apparently to unbuckle his harness, but his hands were frozen stiff and he could not lever himself out of the cockpit, Mr. Hudner said. Mr. Hudner clambered onto the wing of Mr. Brown’s plane, but his boots, slick with ice and snow, slid and he could not grab his friend. Mr. Hudner went back to his plane and called for a rescue helicopter to come with an ax and a fire extinguisher. “I was trying to console him and assuring him help was on the way.” By the time an American helicopter arrived Mr. Brown had grown weak. “He told me, ‘If anything happens to me, tell my wife, Daisy, I love her.’ ” The helicopter pilot told Mr. Hudner that darkness was coming, and they had to leave. “I told Jesse we couldn’t get him out without more equipment, and we were going to get more. He didn’t respond. I think he died while we were talking to him.” During his visit to Pyongyang, Mr. Hudner met twice with three North Korean army officers to discuss the return of Mr. Brown’s remains from the crash site. In the end, he was told that he should return in September when the weather was more predictable. The North Koreans wanted a representative of the United States Joint P.O.W./M.I.A. Accounting Command, the arm of the military that sends recovery teams to old battlefields to retrieve the remains of American soldiers, to come on the return trip, Mr. Hudner said. The command ceased working with North Korea in 2005, in protest of the North’s disputed nuclear program. Mr. Hudner, who received a Medal of Honor for his actions, said it was disappointing not to go to the crash site. “But we were gratified by the encouragement” of the North Koreans to return, he said. “From what we’ve seen, something positive will come out of getting the remains.”

Officials searched the personal e-mails and tried to track the movements of a Fox News correspondent, James Rosen, in investigating a leak.

The White House on Monday defendedPresident Obama’s support for aggressive investigations into national security leaks despite new disclosures about a 2009 case in which the Justice Department searched a reporter’s personal e-mails and attempted to track his movements. Details of the government’s investigation of the reporter,James Rosen, the chief Washington correspondent for Fox News, emerged in acourt affidavit obtained by The Washington Post. Without naming Mr. Rosen, the document describes the reporter as “at the very least, either as an aider, abettor and/or co-conspirator.” The case involved a2009 article by Mr. Rosen about North Koreathat was published onFoxNews.com. Mr. Rosen reported that intelligence officials expected North Korea to respond to the passage of a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning its nuclear and ballistic missile tests by launching another missile. He quoted a source who described missile activity in North Korea, but Mr. Rosen said he was withholding some details “to avoid compromising sensitive overseas operations.” The Justice Department subsequently investigated the leak andindicted a government adviser, Stephen Jin-Woo Kim.He has pleaded not guilty. The government used records tracking Mr. Rosen’s use of his security badge at the State Department, apparently trying to establish his connection to Mr. Kim. Mr. Rosen was not charged with any crime. But the suggestion that he was a “co-conspirator” appalled many of his colleagues, some of whom rallied to his defense on Monday. Michael Clemente, the executive vice president of news at Fox News, said network officials were outraged to learn that Mr. Rosen “was named a criminal co-conspirator for simply doing his job as a reporter.” Mr. Clemente called it “downright chilling” and added, “We will unequivocally defend his right to operate as a member of what up until now has always been a free press.” The revelations may complicate what has been a contentious relationship between the Obama administration and Fox News, whose conservative talk show hosts are among Mr. Obama’s most vocal critics. Mr. Rosen works on the news side of Fox, not the opinion side; he did not comment publicly on the affidavit’s contents. The details about Mr. Rosen’s case came just daysafter The Associated Press revealedthat the government had seized two months of telephone records for some of its reporters in a similar leak investigation. Under intense questioning from reporters on Monday, Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, declined to comment on Mr. Rosen’s case, but emphasized Mr. Obama’s desire to investigate serious leaks of government information. “The president believes, I think, as all of his predecessors believed, that it is imperative that leaks that can jeopardize the lives of American men and women serving overseas should not be tolerated,” Mr. Carney said. He added that the president seeks balance when it comes to security and the right of reporters to pursue stories without fear of investigation.

The move by North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, might be an attempt to rejuvenate the country’s staggering economy and to curtail top generals’ influence.
==::==

==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — The North Korean leaderKim Jong-unhas begun stripping his country’s powerful military of its lucrative export rights in a bold attempt intended to both rejuvenate its staggering economy and curtail top generals’ influence, according to a Seoul-based Web site run by defectors fromNorth Korea. Although it is impossible to confirm most information about isolated North Korea, there have been hints that Mr. Kim might be unhappy with the stewardship of parts of the economy. In a speech distributed by the state news media in April, he said he intended to keep a tighter control on minerals exports, some of which analysts believe are controlled by the military. “Some people are now attempting to recklessly exploit the country’s valuable underground resources on the excuse of earning foreign currency by exporting them,” he said, without mentioning who the culprits were. In addition, South Korean news media this week quoted unidentified government sources who said an apparent fight over the military’s hold on important exports might have been behind this week’s dismissal of a top army official, Ri Yong-ho. South Korean officials and analysts said it was too early to tell whether Mr. Kim’s reported plan to deprive the military of its ability to earn foreign currency, even if true, was a precursor for wider-ranging changes to North Korea’s ailing economy or just a means of taming the military. The country’s previous attempts to experiment with economic reforms have mostly floundered in the face of the government’s fear about opening up to the world. There is also no clear indication that Mr. Kim is backtracking from his vow, made in an April speech, to honor his father’s “military first” policy, which dedicated resources to building the country’s military might, including its nuclear program. The Web site that covered the reported change in export policy, theNorth Korea Strategic Information Service Center, is one of a group of Internet sites that rely on defectors and their sources within North Korea. The sites have a mixed record, producing scoops but also contradictory reports that are not confirmed. According to the center, which cited unnamed sources in the North, the Workers’ Party in mid-June began transferring all the military’s foreign currency-earning operations to the cabinet or an independent committee. The report also quoted a policy statement that it says its sources read, but that was never published by North Korean state news media. “The military has developed a taste for money,” the Web site quoted Mr. Kim as saying. “From now on, the party and the state will provide bullets and guns for the military, and the military should just focus on how best it can fight.” That policy, if confirmed and enforced, would represent a significant shift in the role and status of the 1.1 million-man North Korean military, whose influence expanded vastly under Mr. Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, who died in December. When North Korea faced a debilitating famine in the 1990s, Kim Jong-il counted on the loyalty of the People’s Army as the best protection for retaining his grip on power. He depended on the military to police the population. Although the military already had a source of income, running its own factories and farms, it gained more lucrative privileges under Mr. Kim, like the right to export not only weapons but minerals, mushrooms and seafood. For years, defectors have reported that the change has fueled corruption among senior military officers and that their families have engaged in lucrative trade deals. Many analysts in South Korea have suggested there is a continuing power struggle between the People’s Army and Kim Jong-un’s uncle, Jang Song-thaek, who is believed to have joined forces with allies in the Workers’ Party to undercut the military’s influence. Mr. Jang, a longtime party insider, is widely seen as having been designated by Mr. Kim to help revive the economy. Last year, he led the North Korean delegation to the groundbreaking ceremony for an industrial complex the country is building in the northwest with China. Analysts see generals like Mr. Ri, who enjoyed the perks provided under Kim Jong-il, as the biggest potential stumbling block for attempts by Mr. Jang and party technocrats to experiment with economic reforms and openness. “Ri Yong-ho’s fall may not be the end, but just the beginning, of the power struggle,” Cho Han-bum, a North Korea specialist, said in an analysis published this week on the Web site of the South Korean government-runKorea Institute for National Unification. “The question is whether the old forces, centered around the military, will revolt.”

The appearance of costumed versions of Tigger, Minnie Mouse and other characters from the United States, North Korea’s enemy, was remarkable fare on tightly controlled North Korean television.

TOKYO — After a failed missile launching, aborted diplomacy with Washington, and continuing international pressure over the country’s nuclear program,North Korea’s untested young leader has tried once again to take a dramatic step with his isolated, impoverished nation, this time with a bit of unapproved help from Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh. North Korean state-run television on Monday showed footage of costumed versions of Tigger, Minnie Mouse and other Disney characters prancing in front of the leader,Kim Jong-un, and an entourage of clapping generals. The footage also showed Mr. Kim in a black Mao suit watching as Mickey Mouse conducted a group of young women playing violins in skimpy black dresses. At times, scenes from the animated Disney movies “Dumbo” and “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” were projected on a multipanel screen behind the entertainers; an article in the state-run press said unnamed foreign songs were on the bill. The appearance of the characters from the United States, North Korea’s mortal enemy, was remarkable fare on tightly controlled North Korean television, which usually shows more somber and overtly political programs. A Disney spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha, had no comment Monday beyond a statement: “This was not licensed or authorized by the Walt Disney Company.” As with many things in the North’s bellicose and reclusive Stalinist government, Mr. Kim’s rationale was a mystery, but there was a hint that the performance might be significant. An article about the performance by North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said that Mr. Kim, who took over after the death in December of his father, Kim Jong-il, had a “grandiose plan to bring a dramatic turn in the field of literature and arts this year.” The footage included a segment with a broadly smiling Mr. Kim — with his marked resemblance to his revered grandfather, Kim Il-sung, the nation’s founder — gesturing like a symphony conductor as he gave guidance on music and art to what appeared to be a half-dozen North Korean reporters busily scribbling in notebooks, one of them in a military uniform. The article on the performance said it featured a band organized by Mr. Kim himself. Adding to the enigma offered, an unnamed young woman was seated next to Mr. Kim. Speculation about her identity ranged from sister to love interest. There have been expectations that Mr. Kim, who is believed to be in his late 20s and to have been educated in Switzerland, might try to take his nation in a new direction with some sort of opening to the West. However, he has also at times shown the same rigid defiance as his father. This mix of opening and confrontation was apparent in April, when Mr. Kim’s government ignored international condemnation to launch a multistage rocket it said carried a satellite. The United States said it was a ballistic missile test. The launching, which was uncharacteristically opened to select overseas media organizations, proved a humiliating setback when the vehicle exploded minutes after liftoff. It prompted the Obama administration to scuttle a month-old deal that had briefly raised hopes of reducing tensions by allowing inspections of the North Koreannuclear weaponsprogram to be resumed. The performance was not the first time the Kim dynasty’s fate had been entwined with Disney. In 2001, the current leader’s older brother, Kim Jong-nam, was apparently banished from the line of succession after being detained by the Japanese authorities while trying to enter Japan on a Dominican Republic passport to visit Tokyo Disneyland.

Kim Jong-un’s first public speech came two days after a North Korean rocket carrying a satellite disintegrated in midair.

2012-04-16T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — In his first speech in public since assuming the leadership ofNorth Korea,Kim Jong-unsaid Sunday that his “first, second and third” priorities were to strengthen the military, and he declared that superiority in military technology was “no longer monopolized by imperialists.” Mr. Kim’s speech was followed by what South Korean officials said was the North’s biggest display of weapons in a military parade, including a missile the North appeared to be presenting for the first time. While it is not clear whether it was a new long-range missile or a mock-up, its display demonstrates the importance that the North Korean government places on weapons development despite an embarrassing failure of a rocket it launched last week. South Korean officials would not comment on the North Korean missile, pending further examination. Mr. Kim’s claim to superior military technology could sound poignant, coming two days after the North Korean rocket carrying a satellite disintegrated in midair. The failure of the rocket indicated that North Korea might still have a long way to go before mastering the technology to deliver warheads atop an intercontinental ballistic missile. Mr. Kim’s speech on the 100th birthday of Kim Il-sung, his grandfather and the North’s founding president, was his public political debut. In an unexpected 20-minute speech, broadcast live inside North Korea, Mr. Kim demonstrated a new leadership style but reaffirmed his adherence to the “military first” policy of his father, Kim Jong-il, which has left North Korea locked in a prolonged confrontation with the United States and its allies. His speech was a major departure from the practices of his reclusive father, who cloaked his brutal rule in mystery and who never gave a speech to the general public before his death in December. North Koreans did not even hear Kim Jong-il’s voice until a broadcast in 1992, when he shouted one sentence into the microphone while inspecting a military parade: “Glory to the heroic soldiers of the People’s Army.” On Sunday, facing tens of thousands gathered in a plaza in the capital, Pyongyang, Mr. Kim did not mention the rocket failure. Instead, he exhorted his people to appreciate the achievements of his father and grandfather, crediting them with developingnuclear weaponsas a deterrent against American invasion. “The days are gone forever when our enemies could blackmail us with nuclear bombs,” he said. Mr. Kim has been seen but not heard by the public since taking over after his father’s death. A thunderous cheer erupted when he appeared on the podium, waving a hand at the crowd gathered beneath in neat rows for the meticulously choreographed festivities. Thousands of balloons were released. An emotional North Korean television broadcaster marveled at how the young leader had “the look and voice” of his charismatic grandfather, who is much revered in the North. Reading a prepared text, Mr. Kim spoke in a calm, measured and somewhat husky voice, occasionally looking up from the text to squint at the crowd under the sun. The only gesture he made was when he raised a finger to emphasize the last sentence of his speech: “Let’s go on for our final victory.” Analysts said that Mr. Kim’s physical resemblance to his grandfather, his gregariousness in the public eye — easily mixing with soldiers, workers and aging generals — and even his willingness to address the nation on state television were carefully cultivated assets for a leader in his late 20s hoping to give his government a more youthful appeal. (The portraits of Marx and Lenin that once adorned prominent buildings in Pyongyang were taken down ahead of the Sunday celebrations, The Associated Press reported from the North Korean capital.) Cheong Seong-chang of the Sejong Institute, a private research institute in South Korea, said Mr. Kim’s performance reminded North Koreans of Kim Il-sung, who as a young leader used to meet citizens and give public speeches. “Kim Jong-il inspired awe and dread among his people and was never a leader friendly with the public,” Mr. Cheong said. “Like his grandfather, however, Kim Jong-un has so far tried to look more willing to communicate with his people. We may see him speak in public more often.” Sunday’s speech and parade were the culmination of weeks of festivities intended to infuse the North Koreans with pride that their country, as its propagandists put it, has become a military power despite decades of economic hardship. “Yesterday, we were a weak and small country trampled upon by big powers,” Mr. Kim said. “Today, our geopolitical location remains the same, but we are transformed into a proud political and military power and an independent people that no one can dare provoke.” He said he was determined to make sure that his people “will never have to tighten their belt again.” Yet he did not offer concrete economic programs, other than a vague reference to the need for an “industrial revolution.” Neither did he mention that his rocket launching had led to the cancellation of badly needed Americanfood aid. The United States and its allies have called for censuring North Korea at the United Nations Security Council. But China appealed for all sides to “remain calm and exercise restraint” on Sunday after its foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, talked with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and the South Korean foreign minister, Kim Sung-hwan, in separate telephone conversations. Some analysts say that the insecurity created by the rocket failure may push Kim Jong-un to rely more heavily on the military and attempt an even more provocative nuclear test in an effort to be taken seriously. The Korean People’s Army, with about 1.1 million troops, has become the backbone of political power under Kim Jong-il’s “military first” policy. Kim Jong-un “is not secure enough” to endorse a possible demand from moderates in his government for policy shifts after the rocket debacle, said Chang Yong-seok, a senior researcher at Seoul National University’s Institute for Peace and Unification Studies. “He still relies on his dead father’s authority to justify his rule.” Hours after the failure of the rocket marred his ascension to North Korea’s highest posts, Mr. Kim promoted 70 officers to the rank of general, the North’s main ruling party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, reported Saturday. Mr. Kim ordered the promotions as one of his first actions after becoming chairman of the National Defense Commission. The post was the last of the top military, party and state titles he has inherited from his father.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Korea’s state-run television called its young, untested leader,Kim Jong-un, a “military genius” on Sunday and showed him driving a tank, sitting in the cockpit of a warplane and interacting with soldiers in a youthful display of camaraderie that was unlike the style of his late father. The broadcast, a documentary on North Korea’s Central TV, also claimed that Mr. Kim, believed to be in his late 20s, oversaw the April 2009 test launch of the country’s long-range rocket. “I had determined to enter a war if the enemies dared to intercept” the rocket, he was quoted as saying in the program, which showed him and his father visiting the control center during the test. The program appeared to be part of North Korea’s frenzied campaign to burnish Mr. Kim’s credentials as a leader who can command its army of 1.2 million soldiers, which is one of the world’s largest armed forces and is crucial to his consolidation of power. Mr. Kim took over after his father, the longtime dictator Kim Jong-il, died on Dec. 17. Late last month, he became supreme commander of the military, officially taking on the first of his father’s  several top military and party posts. North Korea’s propaganda campaign has since billed him as the “great successor” of his father’s “songun,” or “military first,” policy, which emphasizes military might. But the North’s development of nuclear weapons and tests of long-range missiles have brought economic sanctions that have deepened the country’s isolation and poverty. Sunday’s documentary began with Mr. Kim riding a white horse, as his father often did in propaganda murals in North Korea. It was unclear when and where much of the video had been shot. Mr. Kim was said to have been groomed as successor at least from 2008, when his father had a stroke. He was officially unveiled as heir in 2010, when he was made a four-star general and vice chairman of the Workers’ Party’s Central Military Commission. Although he is said to have graduated from the top military academy in Pyongyang, there is no indication that he served in the army. The North Korean media have been busy filling in the gaps in his military résumé, claiming that he wrote his first thesis on military strategy when he was 16. During his New Year’s Day inspection of a tank division, he participated in a firing exercise, “making the New Year’s first sound of gunfire,” the documentary said. Unlike his father, who usually stood solemnly during such inspections and was kept at a reverential distance from soldiers unless he took group pictures, Mr. Kim was seen laughing and clutching the hands of officers and soldiers. His father rarely made public appearances for three years after his own father, North Korea’s founding president, Kim Il-sung, died in 1994, and even when he did, he always wore a grim expression. He was said to be in mourning during this time. But Kim Jong-un has lost no time establishing public credentials as a leader. The documentary was broadcast on what is believed to be his birthday. He is believed to have turned 28, 29 or 30. North Korea has not announced his birth date, and the day’s official news reports did not mention the birthday.

What the West gets wrong about North Korean ideology.
==::==
2012-01-08T00:00:00Z
==::==
Pusan, South Korea KIM JONG-UNcan count himself lucky that his first birthday in power falls today, on a Sunday, obviating the need for a new national holiday to be created at an awkward time. But the ease with which the new “supreme leader” has taken overNorth Koreahas little to do with luck. For one thing, the propaganda apparatus did its job well. We now know why Kim Jong-un was such a peripheral figure on the evening news until his father’s death: so that North Koreans’ first long look at the pampered young man would be at the rarest of times — a time when he was suffering more than anyone. More important, though, is the fact that his succession makes perfect sense in North Korea’s ethno-nationalist personality cult. People who value racial purity always consider some bloodlines purer than others, and in “the Kim Il-sung race,” as North Koreans call themselves, no bloodline is purer than the eternal president’s. Kim Jong-un’s increasingly obvious efforts to copy his revered grandfather’s appearance and mannerisms (right down to hissignature) are naturally meant to show that — as a Korean saying goes — blood doesn’t lie. Membership in the great family is also thought to provide greater access to the elders’ wisdom. This makes the time Kim Jong-un spent away in a Swiss school especially problematic, but the propaganda apparatus may be planning to ignore that part of his life altogether. (The latest reports suggest that he is now being credited with having written, at the age of 16, a treatise on his grandfather’s thought, presumably while in Pyongyang, the capital.) In any case, the notion that army generals or any other important faction would object to Kim Jong-un’s takeover was an improbable one to begin with; no North Korean could oppose the hereditary succession without being opposed to the state itself. Such an attitude is unlikely to be held by anyone in the ruling elite. Unfortunately, the West seems determined to continue paying as little attention to North Korean ideology as possible. In the past few weeks the country’s propaganda has been quoted more for comic relief than anything else. (A few over-literal readings of its flowery imagery have made it seem even more bizarre than it is.) Meanwhile the race-thinking pervading the official rhetoric has been ignored, as has the imperial-Japanese provenance of so much of it, like the talk in recent weeks of defending Kim Jong-un with “human bombs” if necessary. Most of the news media around the world continue viewing North Korea as it does not view itself, namely as a Communist state. The result has been a lot of old-school Kremlinological fuss about the power hierarchy. Several reporters have asked for my opinion on whether Kim Jong-un’s main string-puller will be his uncle, Jang Song-taek, or Vice Marshal Ri Yong-ho, though no one has yet been able to explain to me why the question matters. After all, there is no evidence of significant disagreement inside the ruling elite in regard to any issue. By Communist standards, the North Korean masses would have to judge both the government’s economic performance and the succession in the harshest possible terms. It is because they judge them by very different standards that Kim Jong-un was able to take over so effortlessly while promising to budge “not an inch” from his father’s line. We should therefore not make too much of the fraudulence of all that on-screen wailing. Just because North Korean TV never films anything before rehearsing all spontaneity out of it does not mean the average citizen was unmoved. By ultra-nationalist, militarist criteria, which have more to do with North Koreans’ perception of where the country stands in the world than material living conditions, the Dear Leader did a very good job indeed: the Korean Central News Agency may well be correct in saying he made the country virtually impregnable. That very boast, however, makes things harder forKim Jong-il’s successor. Though he appears secure inside the elite, the state as a whole must continue showing the masses that it is worthy of its beloved founder. If nuclear armament is to be seen as a closed victorious chapter, the new leader must approach the final tasks in his grandfather’s to-do list, as impossible as they may seem from an outsider’s perspective: drastic economic growth and national reunification. Perhaps we can discount the rumor — reported in 2010 — that internal Workers’ Party memorandums have described unification as a requisite for prosperity, because in the latest official New Year’s editorial, at least, reunification is thought possible in the near future only if the enemy “dares to infringe upon our dignity and sovereignty.” Even so, there is no reason to assume that the government’s interest in economic matters will reduce tension on the peninsula. Judging from the stale voluntarism espoused in North Korea this month — the same old calls to emulate this or that heroic factory, to make better use of available resources and so on — Kim Jong-un will not be advocating any significant reforms. Whether North Korea continues muddling along on Chinese life support, or grows fast enough to start resembling South Korea circa 1980, the military-first government must still justify its separate existence alongside the rival state. How can it do this, except through more displays of military strength and superiority? When the new leadership vaunts its adherence to the old leadership’s policies, it is merely trying to make a virtue out of necessity.

Responding to the growing threat of a humanitarian crisis, the European Union said it would provide about $14.5 million in emergency aid.
==::==

BRUSSELS — Responding to the growing threat of a humanitarian crisis inNorth Korea, theEuropean Unionannounced on Monday that it will provide about $14.5 million in emergency aid to feed more than some 650,000 North Koreans. The bloc’s executive body, the European Commission, said that after its experts witnessed evidence of a developing crisis last month during a mission toNorth Korea, it negotiated an agreement with the North Koreans about how to monitor the delivery of assistance. “Increasingly desperate and extreme measures are being taken by the hard-hit North Koreans, including the widespread consumption of grass,” the European Commission said in a statement. The severity of the situation prompted a switch of tactics by the commission. In 2008, it stopped sending humanitarian aid to North Korea in favor of offering financing for longer-term development projects. “The purpose of this aid package is to save the lives of at least 650,000 people who could otherwise die from lack of food,” Kristalina Georgieva, a European commissioner, said in the statement. “Our experts saw severely malnourished children in hospitals and nurseries where no treatment was available. “North Korea’s chronicnutritionproblem is turning into an acute crisis in some parts of the country.” Former PresidentJimmy Carterand two other former presidents,Mary Robinsonof Ireland andMartti Ahtisaariof Finland, and former Prime MinisterGro Harlem Brundtlandof Norway traveled to North Korea in April and issued grave warnings about the food situation there. (All four are members of theElders, an independent group of world leaders established byNelson Mandela.) Mr. Carter was particularly concerned about the refusal of the United States and South Korea to send humanitarian assistance to the North, saying their deliberate withholding offood aidamounted to “a human rights violation.” Mr. Carter, 86, who was not traveling as an official American envoy, had been invited to North Korea for meetings with senior political and military officials. Mrs. Robinson echoed Mr. Carter’s concerns about what she called the “very serious crisis” over food supplies in North Korea because of a harsh winter, severe flooding and an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. She said the withdrawal of American and South Korean food shipments had aggravated a dire situation, which had become, she said, “a matter of life-and-death urgency.” The United States recently sent a team of experts to evaluate food and hunger conditions in North Korea. But the Obama administration has not yet decided about a resumption of food shipments. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said recently that “North Korea must address our serious concerns about monitoring.” Integral to any agreement to restart American aid deliveries, she said, would be “our ability to ensure and monitor that whateverfood aidis provided actually reaches the people who are in need.” After his trip in April, Mr. Carter said North Korean officials had guaranteed to make changes to the aid-distribution system so that Western governments and donors could track their deliveries and be certain that their aid was not being diverted to the military or the ruling elite. The European aid will be distributed through theWorld Food Program, which has been used by the United States and other countries and donors. Ms. Georgieva said it would be strictly monitored, from the point of delivery at ports to when it reached recipients. “If at any stage we discover that the aid is being diverted from its intended recipients, then the commission will not hesitate to end its humanitarian intervention,” she said. According to the European Commission, its experts found that in North Korea the state-distributed food rations had been more than halved in recent months. Two-thirds of the population depends on the rations, it said. The per-person ration, which had been 400 grams of cereals per day, about 14 ounces, was reduced to 150 grams, about 5.3 ounces, in June. That is a fifth of the daily average nutritional requirement, according to European experts. Most of the rations consist of corn. “Food assistance will reach children under 5 who have already been hospitalized with severe acutemalnutrition,” the commission said in the statement. “Children in residential care will also be fed, as well as pregnant andbreast-feedingwomen, hospital patients and the elderly.” The food shortages have been caused by years of economic mismanagement and underinvestment, and have been made worse by poor weather and a reduction of food imports from China and South Korea. The next main grain harvest is in October. Initially, the North Koreans had planned to import 353,000 tons of grains, but that target was reduced to 220,000 tons, of which about half has been secured so far, European experts said. The North Korean government has promised unrestricted access for random checks related to the aid, the commission said. While distributing the European aid, the World Food Program will pay 400 visits per month to warehouses, institutions caring for children, hospitals and distribution sites.

Tens of thousands of people rallied in Pyongyang one day after the funeral of Kim Jong-il to swear their allegiance to his son, Kim Jong-un, in a dynastic transfer of power.

SEOUL, South Korea — The declaration on Thursday thatKim Jong-unis now the “supreme leader” ofNorth Koreawas an emotional turning point for the hermetic country — reaffirming support for the young heir after nearly two weeks of national mourning for his father,Kim Jong-il. The naming of Mr. Kim as supreme leader was partly a formality — all signals have pointed to his taking over both the military and the powerful Workers’ Party — but it was also an important step in the push to strengthen his position in any power struggles that might follow. Mr. Kim is young — believed to be in his 20s — and untested, making him more vulnerable to challenges. The announcement on Thursday of Mr. Kim’s elevation was made by Kim Yong-nam, the president of the North Korean Parliament, who is considered the ceremonial head of state. It was followed by similar speeches by top party and military officials. “Respected Comrade Kim Jong-un is now supreme leader of our party, military and people,” Kim Yong-nam said, adding that Kim Jong-un “inherits the ideology, leadership, courage and audacity of Comrade Kim Jong-il.” The announcement was made before a crowd of tens of thousands that gathered in a central square in Pyongyang, the North’s capital, for the last official day of mourning for Kim Jong-il. In the past few days, North Korea has showered Kim Jong-un with the honorific titles reserved, until now, for his father: “great leader,” “dear leader,” “peerless leader,” and “the sun of the 21st century.” He was even referred to as the nation’s parent, a designation that North Korea had used for Kim Jong-il and his father, Kim Il-sung. The ceremony on Thursday was particularly symbolic of Kim Jong-un’s rise to the top leadership post: for the first time since his father’s death, he was facing a huge crowd of North Koreans alone — without his father standing by him. Though North Korea declared Kim Jong-un its top leader throughout the carefully choreographed ceremony, and in the relentless pronouncements of the past week, he has yet to take any official titles, like supreme commander of the 1.2 million-strong Korean People’s Army and general secretary of the Workers’ Party. Those are bestowed at meetings of top party and government officials, most likely in the coming months, that in the past have been mere formalities. At noon on Thursday, the country observed three minutes of silence nationwide in memory of Kim Jong-il. Trains and ships sounded their horns, state news media reported. Similar but smaller ceremonies were held in cities across North Korea, the country’s official Korean Central News Agency reported.

SEOUL, South Korea — Officials from the United States andNorth Koreamet in Beijing on Thursday to discuss the possible terms of resuming humanitarian aid shipments to the impoverished North. The meeting followed a series of appeals from United Nations and private American relief agencies for urgent aid for the most vulnerable of North Korea’s population, especially its children and pregnant mothers, who they said suffered from life-threatening malnutrition. But Washington remains concerned that the Pyongyang regime might divert foreign aid to its military. Critics of North Korea also have argued that Washington must focus its relief resources on fighting a more severe food crisis in Africa, rather than helping North Korea, where the regime was accused of spending its resources in importing luxury goods for party elites and financing itsnuclear weaponsprogram. Glyn T. Davies, the American special representative on North Korea policy, told reporters in Beijing on Thursday that the talks were under way. Robert King, Washington’s special envoy for North Korean human rights issues and senior American aid official Jon Brause were meeting with Ri Gun, a senior North Korean Foreign Ministry official. The talks were expected to focus on strict monitoring mechanisms. Victoria Nuland, a State Department spokeswoman in Washington, said that should the United States provide aid, the shipments would include vitamin supplements and high-protein biscuits for malnourished children to prevent the material from ending up “on some leader’s banquet table.” She stressed that no quick decision was expected. “We have said all along not only that we need to continue to assess need, but that were we to decide to go forward with this, we would need to have much more strict and clear monitoring systems in place,” she said. The last American food handouts ended in March 2009, amid rising tensions between Washington and Pyongyang over the North’s nuclear weapons and long-range missile programs. After American aid groups were expelled, North Korea test-launched a long-range rocket and conducted its second nuclear test. The United States rallied more international sanctions against the North. Washington is now exploring ways of drawing North Korea back to six-nation talks aimed at ending its nuclear weapons program, hoping that engaging Pyongyang in dialogue will help ease tensions on the divided Korean Peninsula. It wants North Korea to suspend its nuclear activities so the talks can begin, but the North has demanded that the talks must resume without conditions. American officials insisted there was no link between the food talks and the nuclear impasse. In recent weeks, however, Mercy Corps and four other American relief organizations operating in North Korea have charged that by delaying a decision on aid, Washington was playing politics with humanitarian help for children. Meanwhile, critics offood aidfor the North made the same accusation, saying that Washington must have the courage to say no to the North Korean regime. After a trip to North Korea in October, Valerie Amos, the United Nations’ top relief coordinator, called for urgent relief for children. After anassessment trip to the North last month, the World Food Program and the Food and Agriculture Organization said that North Korea’s harvests this autumn were expected to increase by 8.5 percent compared with a year ago, but that it still needed urgent aid. Foe years, North Korea has suffered chronic food shortages. The problem has been compounded by North Korea’s continued nuclear weapons program and its military provocations against South Korea, which have helped curtail donor contributions. Rising globalfood pricesalso contributed to the problem.

The North Korean soccer team blames musk deer gland extract used to treat players struck by lightning during training for the failed doping tests.
==::==
2011-07-17T00:00:00Z
==::==
FRANKFURT (AP) — Five players for North Korea have tested positive for steroids at the Women’s World Cup in soccer’s biggest doping case at a major tournament in 17 years. The president of FIFA, the sport’s world governing body, said Saturday that after two players were caught during the tournament this month, FIFA tested the rest of the North Korean squad and found three more positive results. “This is a shock,” Sepp Blatter, the FIFA president, said at a news conference. “We are confronted with a very, very bad case of doping, and it hurts.” The last doping case at a major event came at the men’s World Cup in the United States in 1994, whenDiego Maradona, the Argentine star, was ousted after testing positive for the banned stimulant ephedrine. FIFA has met with a North Korean delegation and heard arguments that the steroids were accidentally taken with traditional Chinese medicines based on musk deer glands to treat players who had been struck by lightning June 8 during a training camp. The case will be taken up by FIFA’s disciplinary committee. Two defenders, Song Jong Sun and Jong Pok Sim, tested positive for steroids after North Korea’s first two group games and were suspended for the last match. The team was eliminated in the first round after losses to the United States and Sweden and a draw with Colombia. Blatter said the North Korean federation “wrote to us and they presented their excuses.” He added, “They said that a lightning strike was responsible for this.” The names of the three other players will be made public later, FIFA said. The glands in question come from musk deer living in a swath of Asia from Siberia to North Korea. The hairy, four-centimeter glands can be cut open to extract a liquid that is used for medical purposes. Doping officials have been concerned about such naturally occurring substances in recent years. During the run-up to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, FIFA’s concerns focused on African plants that could give players an unfair advantage by providing energy surges or helping to heal muscle injuries. FIFA investigators who discovered evidence of doping in the North Korean samples were in uncharted territory as such steroids had not previously been encountered. Experts from the World Anti-Doping Agency were called in to confirm the breach of doping rules. “It was very complex,” FIFA’s chief medical officer, Jiri Dvorak, said. He added that the medical officer of the North Korea team provided a sample of the medicine to help the analysis. The musk gland extract “it is not part of the world of doping,” Dvorak said, adding, “It is really the first case in which this has been discovered.” The North Koreans first mentioned the lightning incident after losing their opening match to the United States. When North Korean officials were asked later, they refused to elaborate on the circumstances. Dvorak said the information was still sketchy. “We saw some pictures with ambulances and saw that some players were taken from the pitch, but that is all we have,” he said. North Korea had also gave given information about the treatment of the players, but Dvorak said, “this very first report did not include the traditional Chinese medicine.”

North Korea’s federation appealed the ban on its team because one member, Hong Su Jong, falsified her age. The team and Hong were barred for 30 days last week because she entered the world championships, which begin Saturday in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, using the third birth date of her career. Hong listed her birth year as 1989, although International Gymnastics Federation documents show that she competed at the 2004 Athens Olympics and the 2006 world championships using a birth year of 1985. She won the silver medal on vault at the 2007 worlds listing 1986 as her birth year. If Hong was born in 1989, she would have been ineligible to compete in Athens. Gymnasts must turn at least 16 in the calendar year of an Olympics to be eligible.

Who knew “Mad Men” had hit Pyongyang? North Korea makes an attempt to create brand awareness.

WASHINGTON WHO knew “Mad Men” had hit Pyongyang? Or so it seemed last week, when the North Korean governmentreleased photographs of a rare meeting of the Korean Workers’ Party, and delegates were seen walking purposefully through Pyongyang Station on their way to formally designate the next ruler of the Kim dynasty. That would beKim Jong-un, son of the ailing Dear Leader,Kim Jong-il, and grandson of the Great Leader, Kim Il-sung. The delegates wore suits of nearly identical, somewhat boxy cut, and carried 1960s-style briefcases that the admen of the AMC television series might have swung on Madison Avenue. It was a flashback for anyone lucky enough to have ever strolled the empty streets of Pyongyang, a capital in a time machine, with its Stalin-era ceremonial buildings and limousines that could have fit the Kennedy era. Like the Mad Men, the attendees at the Korean Workers’ Party session were trying to create brand awareness — and they don’t have much time to do so. Pyongyang had decades to build up mythologies about how Grandpa Kim singlehandedly ousted the Japanese, and how Papa Kim offered benevolent “guidance” in building each factory. But the last transition unfolded over 20 years. With Kim Jong-il clearly sick, this transition has to be fast, which is why Kim Jong-un went from civilian to four-star general in an announcement on the state radio. It is also why the photographs last week were read so carefully here in Washington. There were hints of whatNorth Korea’s leaders wish the world to see, and what they hope nobody will notice. “These are pictures about one united party, one enduring bloodline,” said Nicholas Eberstadt of theAmerican Enterprise Institute, “and an obstinate refusal to change direction.”

The sanctions, announced by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, aim to cut off sources of hard currency. 
==::==
2010-07-22T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — The Obama administration announced Wednesday that it would impose further economic sanctions againstNorth Korea, throwing legal weight behind a choreographed show of pressure on the North that included an unusual joint visit to the demilitarized zone by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates. The measures, announced here by Mrs. Clinton after talks with South Korean officials, focus on counterfeiting, money laundering and other dealings that she said the North Korean government used to generate hard currency to pay off cronies and cling to power. While the United States already places heavy sanctions on North Korea, American officials insisted that the new measures would further tighten the financial vise around the secretive and isolated North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, who, according to regional intelligence,is in declining health. The unilateral American action came two months after a South Korean-led investigationfound North Korea responsiblefor the March sinking of theCheonan, a South Korean warship, which killed 46 sailors. The North’s bellicose behavior, analysts say, reflects a deepening power struggle inside the country. But the United States has struggled to build consensus about how harshly to confront the Kim government. While the United Nations Security Council voted tocondemn the sinking of the warship, it did not name North Korea as the culprit because of resistance from China, the North’s neighbor and most important ally. Mrs. Clinton demanded that the North take responsibility for the attack, saying it would continue to be a pariah until it did so. She ruled out any negotiations with the North Korean government until it agreed to relinquish itsnuclear weapons. And she said that the United States would expand and stiffen its sanctions to “target their leadership, target their assets.” “These measures are not directed at the people of North Korea, who have suffered for too long due to the misguided and maligned priorities of their government,” Mrs. Clinton said at a news conference, flanked by Mr. Gates and South Korea’s defense and foreign ministers. “They are directed at the destabilizing, illicit and provocative policies pursued by that government.” Her announcement punctuated a visit rich in symbols of American diplomacy and military might, organized to mark the 60th anniversary of the start of the Korean War. On Tuesday, the United States and South Korea confirmed that they would stagelarge-scale military exercisesin the seas off Japan and the Korean Peninsula, as a show of deterrence against the North. Then, on Wednesday, Mr. Gates and Mrs. Clinton traveled to Panmunjom, in the demilitarized zone, where they clambered up an observation post in a gloomy drizzle to peer into the North. Later, as the pair toured a small building that straddles the military demarcation line between North and South, a North Korean soldier stared at them through a window. Neither acknowledged the soldier. Afterward, the two stood before a phalanx of cameras, under the gaze of guards from the North Korean side, to proclaim solidarity with South Korea. “It is stunning how little has changed up there and yet how much South Korea continues to grow and prosper,” Mr. Gates said, noting that this was his third visit to the demilitarized zone — the first being in the early 1990s when he was director of central intelligence. It was Mrs. Clinton’s first visit. “Although it may be a thin line,”she said, referring to the narrow strip of land separating the two sides, “these two places are worlds apart.” Mrs. Clinton is heading to a regional security meeting in Vietnam on Thursday, where she is likely to face more reluctance to point fingers at North Korea over the Cheonan. On Tuesday, the meeting’s sponsor, theAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations, issued an opening statement that said it “deplored” the sinking but did not name the aggressor. The administration’s show of solidarity with South Korea has complicated ties with China. In addition to its balkiness at the United Nations,Beijing has objected to the joint naval exercises, which have frayed an already tense relationship between the militaries of China and the United States and also prompted a rebuke from North Korea on Thursday. Earlier this year, Beijing brusquelycanceled a planned visitby Mr. Gates. “I remain open to rebuilding and strengthening military-to-military dialogue between the United States and China,” Mr. Gates said. But he added, “We are obviously concerned by some of the things China has said, some of the things China is doing in the military arena; they are worrying.” Administration officials would not give specifics on the planned North Korean sanctions, but said they would mainly build on those already put in place by the Treasury Department or enshrined in the latest Security Council resolution against North Korea. Mrs. Clinton said the United States would designate North Korean companies and individuals involved in weapons proliferation and other illicit activity. As an example, American officials cited trade in counterfeit cigarettes. The sanctions would also focus on liquor, exotic foods and other luxury goods, which the government in Pyongyang uses in a vast system of patronage. And they will take aim at North Korean officials who use diplomatic privilege to cloak their dealings. Mrs. Clinton said she would send her adviser on nonproliferation and arms control, Robert J. Einhorn, in coming days to discuss the sanctions with countries in Asia. Because no legitimate American banks do business with the North, the effectiveness of the measures will depend heavily on persuading banks in other countries to shun North Korea. Given the North’s profound isolation, some analysts question how much more damage sanctions can do. The strategy of aiming sanctions at the country’s elite is similar to the latest United Nations sanctions against Iran. A previous effort to punish politically connected North Koreans, by freezing assets in a Macao-based bank, Banco Delta Asia, where many of them had accounts, was quite successful, analysts said. But the Bush administration later agreed to have the Macao governmentunblock those accountsin an effort to lure North Korea back to negotiations over its nuclear program — a quid pro quo that ultimately led nowhere. The Obama administration insists that it will not cut such deals with the North to restart talks. “They made commitments over the last years to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, which they have reneged on,” Mrs. Clinton said. “They just refuse to actually do it.”

A September meeting of North Korea&#8217;s ruling party is expected to help a son of the ailing North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, consolidate his power as heir.
==::==

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreasaid Saturday that its ruling Workers’ Party would hold a rare meeting of delegates in September to elect a new party leadership, a move analysts in Seoul said was intended to help a son of the ailing North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, consolidate his power as heir. The gathering will be the most important meeting of the party since it held a convention in 1980 to elect Mr. Kim to its Politburo, an event that signaled his rise to power under his father, Kim Il-sung. Saturday’s announcement, carried by the North’s state-run Korean Central News Agency, said only that the party was convening its representatives “in early September to elect its highest leading body.” South Korean intelligence authorities say they have noticed an increased effort by Mr. Kim, who reportedly suffered a stroke in 2008, to hand over power toKim Jong-un, the youngest of his three known sons. North Korea has been publicizing songs and poems implicitly praising the son, South Korea’s spy chief, Won Sei-hoon, told lawmakers on Thursday. The younger Mr. Kim is also accompanying his father on his “on-site guidance” tours of factories and military units, the South Korean news media quoted Mr. Won as telling the lawmakers in the briefing. North Korea’s economic hardships are deepening, as are its conflicts with the outside world. The North’s propaganda artists have produced 10 million copies of the younger Mr. Kim’s portrait and are waiting for an order to distribute them, said Open Radio for North Korea, a Seoul-based Web site that gathers news from sources inside the North. Every household in North Korea keeps portraits of Mr. Kim and his father, who died in 1994, hanging side by side on a wall. Although South Korean officials have identified Kim Jong-un as the likely successor since last year, most North Koreans and people outside the country know little about him. Only a few photographs that are thought to be of him are available outside North Korea, all reportedly taken when he was a teenager. He is now believed to be either 27 or 28. The impending shuffle in the party leadership follows personnel changes in the military and the powerful National Defense Commission in the past year. The North’s rubber-stamp Parliament met this month to replace several cabinet members and appointed Mr. Kim’s brother-in-law, Jang Song-taek, to the No. 2 post at the defense commission. Mr. Jang is seen as a potential caretaker for Mr. Kim’s son. The officials at the September meeting are likely to bestow key party titles on the son or install people loyal to him in important jobs to help him control the party from behind the scenes, analysts said. “We can expect a big shift” in North Korea, “with Kim Jong-un’s influence gradually eclipsing that of his father among the power elite,” said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior analyst at the Sejong Institute, a South Korean research organization.

All the Democratic Party’s reigning families were brought together around the drama of the North Korea trip.
==::==

WASHINGTON — It was a gripping moment:Bill Clinton, the former president, andAl Gore, his vice president, sharing a lengthy embrace as Mr. Clinton delivered two journalists who worked for Mr. Gore back to American soil from captivity in North Korea. Thetableau at the airportin Burbank, Calif., on Wednesday morning was a visible reminder of how circumstances had conspired over the past few days to bring the reigning — and sometimes warring — names of the Democratic Party together around the drama of Mr. Clinton’s trip to North Korea. There on the tarmac were the two dominant Democrats of the 1990s, Mr. Gore and Mr. Clinton, who had played a critical role negotiating the end of an international crisis on behalf of President Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton, the secretary of state and Mr. Obama’s rival for the nomination in 2008. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore did not linger together in public on Wednesday. They have had relatively little contact after their unhappy parting nearly nine years ago, according to associates of the two men. Still, over eight years, they have both built post-White House identities and reputations that seem to have left them at peace with their shared pasts and, it would seem, with each other. “A special thanks to President Clinton,” Mr. Gore said, as Mr. Clinton gazed at him, his head nodding. “My partner and friend. So grateful.” Mike Feldman, a Democratic consultant who has worked for both men, said: “Look, they’ve both gone off and done different things. But when you work side by side as they did, that’s a pretty strong bond and that doesn’t go away. People say they don’t spend a lot of time together — well, they live in different cities.” For just a moment — even with  extra heft and grayer hair — it was easy to recall the happier and era-defining time when Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore captured the attention of the nation,campaigning in a bus caravanin 1992 as the Democratic candidates for president and vice president. On the campaign trail, and later in the White House, the two men and their spouses presented themselves as friends: Sharing a bus and jokes and warm embraces, Mr. Gore introducing Mr. Clinton at every stop on the way, feeding off each other’s riffs and energies. Still, associates of both men said, that relationship was always more pragmatic than personal, a recognition by two very ambitious men, whose similar backgrounds almost ensured a rivalry, that they had stumbled across a chemistry that could deliver them the White House. The tensions that seem to invariably sour relationships between presidents and vice presidents by the end emerged in the Clinton White House, building to the moment when Mr. Gore made clear to associates his revulsion after learning that Mr. Clinton had had an affair with an intern. Mr. Gore confronted Mr. Clinton in the Oval Office after Mr. Gore ran for president in 2000 and lost the electoral vote to George W. Bush ona ruling by the Supreme Court. In the course of a brutal one-hour exchange, aides to both men said, Mr. Gore blamed Mr. Clinton for his loss — suggesting that he had been dragged down by the burden of Mr. Clinton’s impeachment proceedings — and Mr. Clinton angrily attacked Mr. Gore for distancing himself from Mr. Clinton and his record. Mr. Gore avoided appearing with Mr. Clinton in the first years after his defeat, and was viewed in Clinton circles as implicitly supporting Mr. Obama in his competition last year with Mrs. Clinton — though one associate of Mr. Clinton said the former president was appreciative in the end that Mr. Gore had sat it out. But much of that had passed by the time Mr. Gore called Mr. Clinton 10 days ago and asked for his help. And while they have crossed paths from time to time, there has clearly been nothing like the moment on Wednesday when Mr. Gore — spotting Mr. Clinton at the top of the steps coming off the aircraft — walked forward, clapping his hands loudly, leading the audience in applause. They shook hands first, and than hugged for a full five seconds, Mr. Clinton patting his hand along Mr. Gore’s back, lingering, before Mr. Clinton went on to greet the waiting family members.

Obama needs to recognize that there is no longer any middle way in dealing with Pyongyang&#8217;s nuclear ambitions. The U.S. either has to accept the North as a nuclear power, or get tough.
==::==

The Obama administration has so far dealt publicly with the North Korean challenge in an understated, almost leisurely, manner. Emphasizing continued reliance on multilateral diplomacy, it has invited Pyongyang to return to the conference table, even while North Korea threatens military action and tests nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them  —     in the face of a declaration by all the major world powers that such actions are “unacceptable.” The challenge goes far beyond the regional security issue. For America, it involves relations with an emerging superpower (China); relations with a re-emerging Russia; relations with key U.S. allies (Japan and South Korea); and a major escalation in the threat of proliferation to non-state parties. The resumption of nuclear and missile testing by North Korea represents an abrupt reversal of a negotiating process that has been going, with only brief interruptions, for nearly two decades. Since 2004, six-party talks in Beijing included all the countries (North and South Korea, China, Russia, Japan and the United States) directly threatened by North Korean missiles and nuclear weapons. For a while, it was argued that bilateral negotiations between the United States and North Korea would prove more effective. That debate has become largely academic. Both approaches were pursued; both contributed to the stalemate inherited by the Obama administration. I favored negotiations with Pyongyang and have occasionally participated in Track II dialogue with Korean officials outside formal channels. But with North Korea kicking over all previous agreements repeatedly,  process has overwhelmed substance. The ultimate test of the Korean diplomacy always had to be the elimination of North Korea’s stockpile of fissionable material and nuclear weapons. But those were growing while the negotiations were proceeding at their stately pace. The negotiating process thereby ran the risk of legitimizing North Korea’s nuclear program by enabling Pyongyang to establish a fait accompli by means of diplomacy. That point is fast approaching if it has not already been reached. The incoming Obama administration gave North Korea every opportunity to accelerate the negotiating process. While on a visit to Beijing, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton hinted that she was seriously considering a visit to Pyongyang. Stephen Bosworth, a distinguished scholar and moderate diplomat, was appointed principal negotiator. These overtures were vituperatively rejected. Pyongyang used the change of American administration to signal a major shift in course. Bosworth was rebuffed while on a visit to the region. Refusing to return to the negotiating table, Pyongyang  also revoked all the concessions it had previously made. It has restarted its nuclear reprocessing plant and conducted another nuclear weapons test. Many explanations have been advanced for the brazenness of North Korean tactics, such as a domestic struggle for succession to the clearly ailing “Dear Leader” Kim Jong-il. But the only partially rational explanation is that North Korea’s leaders have recognized that no matter how conciliatory United States diplomacy, it would in the next phase demand the destruction of North Korea’s existing weapons capability. Pyongyang’s leaders have obviously decided to reject this outcome in the most absolute and confrontational manner. They must have concluded that no degree of political recognition could compensate for abandoning the signal (and probably sole) achievement of their rule, for which they have obliged their population to accept a form of oppression and exploitation unprecedented even in this period of totalitarianism.  They may well calculate that weathering a period of protest is their ticket to emerging as a de facto nuclear power. Hence the issue is no longer what forum should be used for negotiations but what their purpose is to be. The minimum precondition for a resumption of either of the existing forums would be that Pyongyang restore the previously implemented agreements that it has recently abrogated  —   especially the mothballing of the plutonium separation plant.  But that is not enough. However the next diplomatic phase is conducted, the United States needs to enter it with the recognition that there is no longer any middle ground between the abandonment of the North Korean program and the status quo. Any policy that does not do away with North Korea’s nuclear military capability, in effect, acquiesces in its continuation. A program of marginal additional sanctions followed by another protracted period of give-and-take would have that practical consequence. The North Korean challenge thus confronts the administration with two basic options: To accept tacitly or openly that the North Korean nuclear program is beyond the point where it can be reversed and to seek to cap it and proscribe any proliferating activities beyond North Korea’s borders; To attempt to end the North Korean nuclear program by a maximum deployment of pressures, which requires the active participation of Korea’s neighbors, especially China. Acceptance of the North Korean nuclear program would fly in the face of American foreign policy since we shepherded the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty through the international community in 1967, as well as of the policy put forward by President Obama only two months ago in a seminal speech in Prague. Acquiescence in a North Korean nuclear program would undermine prospects of the proposed negotiations with Iran. If the North Korean methods practiced during the Korean negotiations become a model for negotiations on Mideast nuclear programs, a chaotic world will beckon. De facto acquiescence in a North Korean nuclear program would require a reconsideration of current U.S. strategic planning. More emphasis would need to be given to missile defense. It would be essential to redesign the American deterrent strategy in a world of multiple nuclear powers  —   a challenge unprecedented in our experience. The enhanced role of non-state actors with respect to terrorism would have to be addressed. A new argument in favor of acquiescence in North Korea’s nuclear program has recently made its appearance. It contends that Pyongyang’s conduct is really a hidden cry for assistance against Chinese domination and thus deserves support rather than opprobrium.  But turning North Korea into a ward of the United States is neither feasible nor acceptable to the countries whose support for a solution of the North Korean nuclear issue is imperative. No long-term solution of the Korean nuclear problem is sustainable without the key players of Northeast Asia, and that means China, South Korea, the United States and Japan, with an important role for Russia as well. A wise diplomacy will move urgently to assemble the incentives and pressures to bring about the elimination of nuclear weapons and stockpiles from North Korea. It is not enough to demand unstated pressures from other affected countries, especially China. A concept for the political evolution of Northeast Asia is urgently needed. Too much of the commentary on the current crisis has concerned the deus ex machina of Chinese pressures on North Korea and complaints that Beijing has not implemented its full arsenal of possibilities. But for China, the issue is not so much a negotiating position as concern about its consequences. If the Pyongyang regime is destabilized, the future of Northeast Asia would then have to be settled by deeply concerned parties amidst a fast-moving crisis. They need to know the American attitude and clarify their own for that contingency. China faces challenges perhaps even more complex than America’s. If present trends continue, and if North Korea manages to maintain its nuclear capability through the inability of the parties to bring matters to a head, the proliferation of nuclear weapons throughout Northeast Asia and the Middle East becomes probable. China will then face the prospect of nuclear weapons in all surrounding Asian states and an unmanageable nuclear-armed regime in Pyongyang. But if China exercises the full panoply of its pressures without an accord with America and an understanding with the other parties, it has reason to fear chaos along its borders at or close to the traditional invasion routes of China. A sensitive, thoughtful dialogue with China, rather than peremptory demands, is essential. The outcome of such a dialogue is difficult to predict, but it cannot be managed unless America clarifies its own purposes to itself. Some public statements imply the U.S. will try to deal with specific North Korean threats rather than eliminate the capability to carry them out. They leave open with what determination Washington will pursue the elimination of the existing stockpile of North Korean nuclear weapons and fissionable materials. It is not possible to undertake both courses simultaneously. The ultimate issue is not regional but concerns the prospects for world order, especially for a Pacific political structure along the lines of that put forward by the thoughtful Australian prime minister, Kevin Rudd. There could scarcely seem to be an issue more suited to cooperation among the Great Powers than non-proliferation, especially with regard to North Korea, a regime run by fanatics, located on the borders of China, Russia and South Korea, and within missile range of Japan. Still, the major countries have been unable to galvanize themselves into action. In this multipolar world, many issues like nuclear proliferation, energy and climate change require a concert approach. The major powers of the 21st century have proved to be heterogeneous and without much experience as part of a concert of powers.  Connecting their purposes, however, needs to be their ultimate task if the world is to avoid the catastrophe of unchecked proliferation.

The U.S. defense secretary raised the idea of a tougher approach toward North Korea in meetings with Asian allies at the annual security conference in Singapore, officials said.

SINGAPORE — Defense SecretaryRobert M. Gatesraised the idea of a tougher approach towardNorth Korea’s recent nuclear test in meetings here with Asian allies on Saturday, including the prospect of building up United States military forces in the region should six-nation diplomatic talks with North Korea fail, American defense officials said. Mr. Gates raised “the notion that we should think about this as we are pursuing the six-party talks,” said a senior defense official who asked for anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue. “We ought to think about what more we need to do should they not prove successful.” But another defense official cautioned that talk of any military buildup was premature and that it was merely a “prudent option” in terms of “what should we be thinking about in the event that we need to start enhancing our posture, our defenses?” On Friday Mr. Gates said that the United States had no plans to reinforce some 28,000 American troops based in South Korea. Mr. Gates, who warned North Korea in a speech here early Saturday that the United States would not tolerate it becoming a nuclear-armed nation, met throughout the day at the conference, called the Shangri-La Dialogue, with defense officials from China, South Korea, Japan and other Asian nations to begin pulling together a consensus on how to proceed. James B. Steinberg, the deputy secretary of State, attended a number of meetings, as did Dennis C. Blair, the director of national intelligence. There was widespread acknowledgement that sanctions against North Korea had to be strengthened because of its nuclear test on Monday and subsequent firings of short-range missiles. There was also general agreement that the long-running six-nation talks aimed at getting North Korea to give up its nuclear program had so far failed. But by Sunday morning, Asian defense officials had not endorsed a specific course of action. “There’s no prescription yet on what to do,” said one of the senior American defense officials. Late in the day on Saturday, Mr. Gates had a meeting focused on North Korea with the defense ministers of South Korea and Japan, a precursor to more detailed discussions to occur next week about North Korea’s nuclear test. Mr. Steinberg is to lead the American team at those meetings; the group will include Stuart Levey, the Treasury under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, an indication that economic measures will be a significant part of the discussions. Mr. Gates met on Saturday with the highest-ranking Chinese official at the conference, Lt. Gen. Ma Xiaotian, the deputy chief of the general staff of the People’s Liberation Army. American defense officials said after the meeting that China, which has been reluctant to take tough action against North Korea, clearly viewed the nuclear test seriously.

PARIS — Across the globe from Washington to Moscow to Beijing,North Korea’s underground nuclear test drew condemnation and criticism on Monday and some governments  threatened  to press for tighter sanctions at the United Nations Security Council. But given the patchy record of sanctions on North Korea, it remained unclear what effect such threats might yield. Prime Minister Taro Aso of Japan said his government would seek a new United Nations resolution to condemn the test. He said an urgent meeting of the Security Council was expected to be held on Monday in New York at Japan’s request. China, whose response was closely watched around the world, said it was “resolutely opposed” to the test, according to a  Foreign Ministry  statement carried by the official Xinhua news agency. China is by far North Korea’s largest trading partner and wields critical diplomatic influence. Russia said the test breached a United Nations Security Council resolution and would “endanger security and stability in the region,” according to the Russian Foreign Ministry in a statement. President Obama was among the first to register protest, saying in a statement that “North Korea is directly and recklessly challenging the international community.” The statement continued: “Such provocations will only serve to deepen North Korea’s isolation. It will not find international acceptance unless it abandons its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.” Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he believed the latest series of tests “just speak to the growing belligerence on the part of North Korea,” The Associated Press reported. Appearing on NBC’s “Today” show on Monday, Admiral Mullen said described North Korea as a country that “continues to destabilize that region and in the long term should they continue to develop anuclear weaponsprogram, poses a grave threat to the United States.” European governments joined the call for Security Council action and said North Korea would not gain international acceptance as long as it followed policies that Prime Minister Gordon Brown ofBritaindescribed as “erroneous, misguided and a danger to the world.” The French Foreign Ministry said in a statement: “France will consult in the coming hours with its partners on the Security Council and in the region on the consequences to draw from this serious act by North Korea, and in particular on strengthening sanctions.” Germany also condemned the test. Several European foreign ministers were heading for a meeting in Hanoi with their Asian counterparts when news of the test broke. Carl Bildt, Sweden’s minister of foreign affairs, called the development “alarming.” Javier Solana, the foreign policy chief of the European Union, said in Brussels that the “irresponsible acts by North Korea warrant a firm response.” After the North’s first nuclear test in October 2006, a United Nations Security Council resolution, drafted by the United States, banned trade with North Korea in materials linked with unconventional weapons, and authorized countries to inspect cargo going into and out of the North. It also sought to outlaw international travel and freeze the overseas assets of people associated with the North’s weapons programs. But doubts about the sanctions arose when South Korea and China indicated that business and economic relations would be largely unaffected. In April 2009, North Korea defied the United States, China and a series of United Nations resolutions by launching a rocket that the country said was designed to propel a satellite into space. Much of the world viewed the test as an effort to prove it is edging toward the capability to shoot a nuclear warhead on a longer-range missile. Following the launch, the Security Council decided unanimously last month to tighten sanctions against North Korea. The White House asked the United Nations sanctions committee to develop a list of North Korean companies to be singled out, focusing on companies involved in missile and nuclear technology. But some analysts said they doubted that these measures would prove effective. They noted that China opposed a stronger United Nations response to the April missile launching. On the Korean peninsula on Monday , news of the test caused an initial drop on South Korean markets, where the benchmark Kospi index plummeted by up to 6.3 per cent before recovering almost all of its losses. The won fell against the dollar but also recovered. The government in Seoul called the North Korean underground test a “direct threat against the peace and stability in the region as well as to the world.” Australia offered “absolute condemnation” and New Zealand expressed worries about the test, as did India. “India is against nuclear proliferation,” India’s Defense Minister A.K. Antony said in New Delhi, The A.P. reported. “It’s a matter of very serious concern not only to India, but to the world.”

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreahas told international aviation and maritime authorities that it will launch a satellite in early April,  the North’s official news agency  and a news agency in  the  South reported  on Thursday. North Korea’s neighbors and Western nations believe the launching is actually cover for testing a long-range missile  capable of reaching the American mainland. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has  said such a  launching would be “very unhelpful.” The North’s state-run Korea Central News Agency said the country notified the international organizations to “ensure the safety of flights and sea vessels.” It did not disclose a date. But  South Korea’s  Yonhap news agency, quoting unidentified  government sources, said the North had told the international organizations that the launching would be between April 4 and 8.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreahas been moving what appear to be components of a long-range missile to a launching site, a South Korean official and news reports said Tuesday, raising fears that it might test-fire a missile. The North Korean move, first reported by the South Korean news agency Yonhap and the Japanese newspaper Sankei Shimbun, came amid concern among political analysts in Seoul, South Korea’s capital, that the North might also try some sort of military provocation to help make its nuclear program a foreign policy priority for the Obama administration. North Korea has launched missiles in the past to win political or economic concessions. In recent weeks, it has said that its military had assumed an “all-out confrontational posture” and that it had scrapped all nonaggression pacts with South Korea. In Washington, a State Department spokesman, Robert A. Wood, said he could not comment on the reports, calling them “an intelligence matter.” But he added: “North Korea’s missile activities and missile programs are of concern to the region. A ballistic missile launch by North Korea would be unhelpful and, frankly, provocative.” Recent spy satellite images showed a train carrying a long, cylindrical object, believed to be a missile, heading to a new launching site on North Korea’s western coast, Yonhap reported, quoting an unidentified government official. But in another dispatch late Tuesday, Yonhap said that intelligence officials were still tracking the train and that there was a possibility that the North would take it to another launching site. A South Korean government official reached Tuesday confirmed the train’s movement, as cited by Yonhap. “We detected such a movement in the last week of January,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue with reporters. The object is believed to be a Taepodong-2 missile, Yonhap said. The missile is designed to fly at least 4,200 miles, far enough to reach North America, and carry a payload of 1,400 to 2,200 pounds, according to the South Korean Defense Ministry. North Korea test-fired the missile in July 2006. But it was considered a failure, with its rocket fizzling out shortly after it blasted off. While not ruling out the possibility of a missile test, analysts and officials in Seoul  said that the North often “puts on a show” at its military facilities to stir up uncertainty among its neighbors.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge has awarded more than $65 million to several men of the Navy spy ship Pueblo, who were captured and tortured byNorth Koreain 1968. The judge, Henry H. Kennedy Jr. of Federal District Court, issued the judgment against North Korea on Tuesday. North Korea did not respond to the lawsuit, which accused it of kidnapping, imprisonment and torture. Four former crewmen of the Pueblo filed the suit in 2006. The Pueblo was seized off North Korea on Jan. 23, 1968, while it was on an intelligence-gathering mission. North Korea says the ship was inside its coastal zone. Navy records say it was in international waters. One crew member was killed in the attack, and 10 were wounded. The crewmen were held captive for 11 months.

North Korea on Sunday welcomed the move and said that it would resume disabling its nuclear weapons facilities.

WASHINGTON — The Bush administration announced Saturday that it had removedNorth Koreafrom a list of state sponsors of terrorism in a bid to salvage a fragile nuclear deal that seemed on the verge of collapse. Sean McCormack, the State Department spokesman, said that the United States made the decision after North Korea agreed to resume disabling a plutonium plant and to allow some inspections to verify that it had halted its nuclear program as promised months earlier. The deal, which the Bush administration had portrayed as a major foreign policy achievement, began slipping away in recent weeks in a dispute over the verification program. Just days ago, North Korea barred international inspectors from the plant. The decision to remove North Korea from the terror list was a dramatic moment for President Bush, who had called the country part of an “axis of evil” and had only reluctantly ordered administration officials to engage in negotiations, saying that the United States had made deals with the nation’s leaders before without winning enough concessions. That calculus changed in 2006, when North Korea exploded a nuclear device. But Mr. Bush is already having trouble selling the new agreement to his own party. Republican lawmakers, including the presidential nominee, Senator John McCain, quickly expressed concern, complaining that North Korea had yet to demonstrate that it was serious about adhering to its commitment to denuclearize. Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee for president, called the deal “a modest step forward” in dismantlingNorth Korea’s nuclear weaponsprogram. Other Democrats said they welcomed the agreement but noted that it did not go much beyond an agreement President Clinton reached with North Korea in 1994, which the Bush administration, including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, criticized as inadequate. Bush administration officials, trying to head off potential criticism that they were simply seeking a foreign policy victory in their last months, said the agreement was the best the United States could get at this time. Ms. Rice “very strongly feels that it is our own responsibility, until Jan. 20, 2009, to act as good stewards of the national interest,” Mr. McCormack said during a news conference. In the most significant part of the accord announced Saturday, North Korea agreed to a verification plan that would allow United States inspectors access to its main declared nuclear compound, at Yongbyon; international inspectors have worked at the site on and off for years. But the deal puts off decisions on the thorniest verification issue: what would happen if international experts suspected the North was hiding other nuclear weapons facilities, particularly those related to uranium enrichment. The United States wanted the North to agree to inspections at sites that raised suspicions, but North Korea balked. The new agreement calls for United States inspectors to be granted access to such sites “based on mutual consent” with North Korea. Experts on North Korea say that the concession by the United States was probably necessary to achieve a deal, but that it no doubt will lead to future fights, since the North’s leaders will not want to give inspectors free rein to travel the country. Patricia A. McNerney, one of the State Department negotiators, acknowledged that issue would probably lead to a hornets’ nest of problems. “Going into verification with North Korea will not be easy, we know that,” she said. “This is the most secret and opaque regime in the world.” North Korea on Sunday welcomed its removal from Washington's terrorism blacklist and said that it would resume disabling its nuclear weapons facilities, allowing American and United Nations monitors back into its main nuclear complex. South Korea and Japan also hailed the agreement on Sunday. But hawkish politicians in Washington's two main Asian allies, as well as relatives of people allegedly kidnapped by the Communist state, accused the United States of giving in to the North's bad behavior. "We are extremely disappointed with the United States, which we had believed would be a pillar of anti-terrorism and human rights," said Choi Sung Yong, 56, head of the Abductees' Family Union, which includes relatives of hundreds of South Koreans, mostly fishermen, allegedly abducted to the North. Relatives of the South Korean and Japanese abductees have counted on Bush to use the terrorism blacklist as leverage to pressure the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, to return their missing family members. North Korea, which has long sought international acceptance, had been pushing hard to get off the terror list. But Mr. McCormack made clear on Saturday that North Korea is still subject to numerous economic sanctions. The agreement follows weeks of intense negotiations and high-stakes brinkmanship, as North Korea, furious that the Bush administration had not removed it from the terrorism list as it agreed last summer, threatened to restart its plutonium-based weapons program and barred international inspectors from the Yongbyon plant. In Washington, State Department proponents of the deal, including Ms. Rice and her top North Korea envoy, Christopher R. Hill, battled critics inside and outside the administration who castigated them for trying to salvage the accord. The administration has been at war with itself over whether to go ahead with the North Korea pact despite objections from critics in the office of Vice President Dick Cheney, and even some members of the State Department’s verification and compliance office. That rift spilled into the open at the news conference on Saturday, when a reporter asked Paula A. DeSutter, the assistant secretary of state for verification, compliance and implementation, how she responded to criticism of the deal from John R. Bolton, her former boss at the State Department. Ms. DeSutter did not defend the accord, saying simply, “John is the epitome of a skeptical policymaker, and that’s appropriate.” Despite the internal fights, Ms. Rice convinced President Bush last week that this was the best the administration could get in its remaining time in office. But as late as Friday, things remained up in the air, said one administration official, who, like several other officials and diplomats interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the issue. Another senior administration official described the internal deliberations as a “close call.” Senator McCain said in a statement that he would not support the deal until he got some questions answered. “I expect the administration to explain exactly how this new verification agreement advances American interests and those of our allies,” he said. He added that he was “concerned that this latest agreement appears to have been reached between Washington and Pyongyang, and only then discussed with our Asian allies in an effort to garner their support.” Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Republican of Florida, issued a statement strongly criticizing the deal. “I am profoundly disappointed,” she said. “By rewarding North Korea before the regime has carried out its commitments, we are encouraging this regime to continue its illicit nuclear program and violate its pledge to no longer provide nuclear assistance to extremist regimes.” Two of the Bush administration’s main criticisms of the 1994 accord were that it did not mandate the removal of nuclear material from North Korea and that international inspectors were limited to  Yongbyon. The 1994 accord collapsed in 2002 after the Bush administration accused North Korea of circumventing the agreement by pursuing a second path to a bomb, based on enriching uranium. The White House said at the time that it would require full verification that any uranium program had been halted, though later the intelligence community expressed some doubts about how far the program had gotten. Although the new agreement leaves open the possibility of future inspections outside Yongbyon, it leaves vague what mechanism would be used to determine the status of a uranium program. The North has agreed in principle to give up its nuclear material and any weapons, but that seems almost certain to be subject to negotiations with the next president. During the Bush administration, North Korea is believed to have produced enough bomb-grade plutonium for six or more nuclear weapons. Bush administration officials have been consulting about the latest deal with its partners in the so-called “six-party” talks, the group including Russia, South Korea and Japan that negotiated the agreement in 2007 for the North to halt its nuclear activities. Diplomats said that Japan had expressed reservations about removing North Korea from the terror list because the North still had not addressed all of their concerns about abductions of Japanese citizens decades ago. After the official announcement on Saturday, Japan’s finance minister, Shoichi Nakagawa, called the American decision “extremely regrettable.” South Korea has been more supportive. “We welcome the agreement because we believe this will help put the six-party negotiations back on track and eventually lead to the dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear programs,” said Kim Sook, South Korea’s main nuclear envoy, during a news conference in Seoul on Sunday. The South Korean foreign minister, Yu Myung-hwan, had stressed Friday that if the six-party negotiations fell apart now, the next administration would have difficulty restarting them. Gary Samore, a nonproliferation expert in the Clinton administration, characterized the deal as probably the best that could be gotten at this time, but warned of stormy times to come. “Every agreement you ever have with the North Koreans always contains certain ambiguities, and that ends up being the basis for which you have the next round of talks,” he said. “It’s always two steps forward and one step back.” For instance, he said, besides the issue of access to suspected nuclear sites, the United States and North Korea appear to have fudged the critical issue of whether American inspectors will be allowed to take all the samples they want out of the country to foreign laboratories for inspection. According to a fact sheet issued by the Bush administration, the two sides agreed “on the use of scientific procedures, including sampling and forensic activities,” although the sheet doesn’t say where those tests would be done. Mr. Bolton, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations under Mr. Bush, said that the Bush administration had “punted” the hardest issue, that of inspections beyond declared nuclear sites. “This means that North Korea has a veto over everything beyond Yongbyon,” he said, “so that’s a clear victory for North Korea.”

The Bush administration is dispatching Christopher Hill to Pyongyang in a last-ditch effort to rescue an accord leading to the country’s nuclear disarmament.

WASHINGTON  — The Bush administration is dispatching its chiefNorth Koreanegotiator, Christopher Hill, to Pyongyang this week in a last-ditch effort to rescue what the White House had hoped would be a singular foreign policy achievement: an accord leading to the country’s nuclear disarmament. The rapid decision to send Mr. Hill to the North Korean capital, days after North Korea broke the seals thatUnited Nationsinspectors placed on its equipment and said it was restarting a facility to manufacture bomb-grade plutonium, seemed to underscore the administration’s desperation to restore an accord that took most of President Bush’s second term to negotiate and implement. Mr. Hill, one administration official said, is “flying blind,” hoping to get a previous agreement back on track. The fact that Mr. Hill is going to Pyongyang at all shows how much has changed in the administration. In his first term. Mr. Bush refused to talk to the country, and American strategy was to hasten North Korea’s economic collapse. But the country refused to buckle, and sped ahead with its nuclear enrichment facility. In more recent years, the administration argued for months about whether to allow Mr. Hill to participate in direct talks with the North Koreans, particularly in Pyongyang. His efforts to go there were repeatedly blocked by hard-liners who argued that to show up in North Korea would be to reward the government there. But if there were any such arguments this time, they appear to have been brief. The United States must decide in the next month or two whether to continue sending oil shipments to North Korea; before it cuts them off, officials say, Mr. Hill wanted to make a direct appeal to the North Korean leadership. But it is not clear who is controlling the country, after reports PresidentKim Jong-ilsuffered a stroke.

The program was vulnerable to manipulation by the North Korean government, the panel said.
==::==
2008-01-25T00:00:00Z
==::==
WASHINGTON — A Senate subcommittee criticized the United Nations Development Program inNorth Koreaon Thursday, accusing it of lax management and poor accountability. But the panel raised serious questions over accusations by the United States Mission to the United Nations that the agency had squandered millions of dollars there. The panel, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, concluded that the program depended excessively on staff members chosen by the North Korean government, that it broke its own rules in using foreign currency rather than local currency, and that it lacked sufficient administrative and fiscal controls and resisted auditing. In a report, the subcommittee cited general “management and operational deficiencies” as leaving the agency “vulnerable to manipulation by the North Korean government.” The program shut its operations in North Korea in March when the country resisted a decision by the development program to stop furnishing payments in hard currency and to stop making local hiring subject to government approval. But much of the hearing on Thursday focused on charges made last year by Mark D. Wallace, an ambassador at the United States mission to the United Nations, in briefings for members of Congress, news outlets, the State Department and nations that finance the development program. Mr. Wallace said then that $2.8 million of program funds had been sent to North Korean missions abroad for the purchase of buildings in Britain, France and Canada; that $2.7 million had been paid to a North Korean financial agent responsible for sales of missiles and arms; and that more than $7 million had been transferred to a North Korean committee it worked with. Mr. Wallace compared the program to the scandal-ridden oil-for-food program in Iraq and suggested that the United Nations money might have ended up financing the North Korean nuclear program. The subcommittee staff report on Thursday said that in fact the $2.8 million sent abroad to buy real estate was actually North Korean, not United Nations, money, and that the amount of money sent to the company suspected of financing arms was $52,000, not $2.7 million. It also accepted the program’s explanation that the link to arms sales of the suspect contact, the Macao-based Zang Lock Trading Company, had not been known at the time. The report said the North Korean representatives had told the committee that their government used a United Nations bank reference as a way of avoiding detection at a time in 2002 when the country had just been labeled by President Bush as a part of the “axis of evil” and feared its power to transfer funds abroad would be restricted. The United Nations had no knowledge of the transaction, the report said. At the hearing the chairman, Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, pressed Mr. Wallace repeatedly to say whether, with what he knew now, he could still make the same charges he had made last year. Mr. Wallace said that he did not know the specific amounts of money involved because of the difficulty of tracking transactions in North Korea, and added that they could be even higher than he had estimated. In an interview outside the hearing room, Mr. Levin expressed frustration at the answer. “I gave him a chance on at least three occasions to acknowledge that some of the points that he made back in May were inaccurate at the time, perhaps based on information that he interpreted, but that nonetheless, he could not make those statements now,” Mr. Levin said. “That doesn’t mean he lied,” Mr. Levin added. “It does mean that he said things at the time that he now knows are not accurate.” In a separate interview, Mr. Wallace said he could not answer the question under oath because he was uncertain about the real figures, and he suggested the committee had been naïve in its conclusions. Disputing the subcommittee’s finding that the $2.8 million sent abroad did not belong to the United Nations Development Program, he said: “The documents say it’s the U.N. imprimatur money. The North Koreans and now the U.N.D.P. say, ‘Well, maybe those documents are not accurate.’ “I didn’t make those documents, the North Koreans did, and they want us to believe it is not U.N. money. If you want to give them the benefit of the doubt, I would submit that I have a bridge for you in Manhattan that I’d sell you for $2.7 million.” The ranking Republican on the committee, Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota, said he thought the United Nations in North Korea had a “keep your wallets open and your mouths shut attitude to the rest of the world.” He said the conduct of the program showed “how rogue regimes try to manipulate the U.N. as much as they can,” adding, “If they were able to use U.N.D.P. as a cover to funnel money, what other rogue nations were able to subvert the system?”

Greg Winter speaks with chief Washington correspondent David Sanger about North Korea, its nuclear weapons program and the international community’s efforts to disband it.

 GREG WINTER. Welcome to the New York Times World View podcast, a weekly conversation with Times foreign correspondents from across the globe. I’m Greg Winter, a foreign editor at The Times. This week, I speak with David Sanger, chief Washington correspondent, about North Korea, its nuclear weapons program and the international community’s efforts to disband it. In the last week, a milestone in those negotiations occurred when North Korea shut down its weapons-making nuclear reactor under the watchful eyes of international inspectors. But in many ways, the wrangling over North Korea’s weapons program has only just begun. Chief Washington correspondent David Sanger has been covering the story and he joins us now from Washington. David, officially, North Korea has shut down its weapons-making facilities but it’s still very much an open question whether North Korea will give up the nuclear weapons it has already produced. What kind of leverage does the international community have on that end of the equation? DAVID SANGER. Well, Greg, we’re about to find out what kind of leverage they have. Remember, this agreement only restores us to the status quo of early 2003, which is when North Korea threw out the international inspectors and took the 8,000 stored fuel rods it had from an old nuclear reactor and turned them into weapons. It’s enough fuel to probably make six, seven, maybe eight weapons, depending on how efficient they are about it. So they went ahead and did that. And now we come along, four years later, having finally gotten them to sign up to an agreement, which they appear to be beginning to implement, and the first step is to close down this reactor so they don’t make that much additional fuel. But there’s nothing in the agreement other than a statement of principle that eventually they will give up all of their weapons. And there are many people who believe that will not happen while this administration is still in office. GREG WINTER. Well, why not? DAVID SANGER. Well, the North Koreans like to get paid for everything they do. And the Bush administration, until it reached this agreement in February, was of the opinion that that was the mistake the Clinton administration made. And they wouldn’t pay them up front to do very much. In the end, they reversed that. And the North Koreans were beginning to get some oil. And as they shut this down and make a declaration about what kind of weapons and other nuclear facilities they have, they’re supposed to get more oil. And that’s supposed to go on through the end of the year and it will probably still, into next year. But they never got to the negotiation about what the price would be for actually giving up the existing nuclear weapons. And as you can imagine, that price is going to be pretty high. GREG WINTER. This past week, North Korea allowed international inspectors into its nuclear sites to verify and monitor the shutdown, but not to determine how many weapons the country has produced. What do we know about the state of North Korea’s nuclear arsenal, if you can even call it that? And what about also the bomb-making material or information it may have gotten from Pakistan? DAVID SANGER. Well, they’re sort of two separate issues. Much of what we know about North Korea’s arsenal is inference. It’s inference from the fact that we had inspectors there and there’s a known quantity of nuclear material they’ve made and you can do the math on the back of an envelope and say this much material can result in that kind of a weapon. But it’s one thing to have the material and another thing to actually engineer the weapon. And when they actually conducted their first nuclear test, which was in October — Oct. 9 of last year — it was sort of a dud. And we don’t even know that it was a full weapon. It may have just been a nuclear device, in other words, something that you couldn’t deliver but that you could set off in a cave. And so we don’t really know the status of their engineering capability. We have a rough idea of how much fuel they have, but that doesn’t necessarily tell you how many of those they’ve made into weapons. And we know how much fuel is sitting in that reactor, so that’s fuel that could be turned into weapons in the future if it’s not brought out of the country. Now, meanwhile, the North Koreans were suspected of starting a second program to get around a nuclear freeze that they had signed with the Clinton administration in 1994. And that is all material, as you suggested, that they bought from Pakistan, specifically from Abdul Qadeer Khan, who was one of the fathers of the North Korean program. And so that material was sold to North Korea, but it’s mostly centrifuges, other equipment. It’s exactly what Iran is using, actually, to try to come up with their nuclear program. But again, we don’t know whether or not the North Koreans actually used it, assembled it, have got any of it producing or whether they stuck it all in a warehouse and said, this is simply too hard. GREG WINTER. When the Bush administration agreed to trade economic incentives for the closure of North Korea’s weapons facilities, it was widely criticized for leaving North Korea’s existing weapons out of the deal. Can you describe the terms of the agreement that still need to be implemented? DAVID SANGER. Well — oh, here’s the rich irony: The reason that they would not strike a deal in the first term was that they said that the Clinton administration made a huge mistake by leaving all the nuclear material in North Korea and then the North Koreans were able to turn that into weapons. So in other words, the deal was too front-loaded; the North Koreans got their reward before they had to turn much over. Well, now you could argue, and some in the Bush administration — some hawks — do, the Bush administration’s gone and done exactly the same thing. And so the issue today is: what additional incentives you’d have to give them in order to get them to turn the stuff over. Right now, the deal for this year and this amount of oil is simply for closing the reactor, closing the related facilities, making a declaration of what nuclear materials they have on hand and then disabling the reactor so that you couldn’t use it to produce more. GREG WINTER. Previous deals with North Korea have quickly fallen apart and international negotiators have admitted that they have a long road ahead of them before seeing this one through. What are the main potential stumbling blocks, as you see it, facing this one? And how do negotiators hope to get around them? DAVID SANGER. Well, the biggest problem is that the North Koreans could simply slow-walk this, Greg. You know, they could simply drag this process out and know that the Bush administration is running out of steam at the end of an administration and that it’s not likely to make a significant nuclear threat to them, or a significant military threat I should say, while we’re tied up in Iraq. So in other words, they might simply take the bet that they can do better with the next president, which may or may not be a good bet. I suspect it probably isn’t. So what can the U.S. do about this? Well, it can try to get the Chinese and the Russians, among others, to go pressure the North Koreans to move faster. But the history of these negotiations over the past few years is that while that is often cited as the administration’s ultimate weapon, it hasn’t worked all that well. GREG WINTER. Finally, what is North Korea’s seeming cooperation with the international community, at least on some issues, mean for Iran? Do analysts expect it to have much of an impact on negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program? DAVID SANGER. Well certainly the Iranians are watching it because they think that anything that the North Koreans get, they can get that and more. But remember there’s a big difference between North Korea and Iran. North Korea is the most isolated country on earth. And it’s starving. It has really very few sources of outside income. Iran has oil. So the Iranians can hold on in a way the North Koreans can’t. Iran is three times the population, a far richer country. That’s going to be a far tougher case. The North Koreans, on the other hand, are much ahead of the Iranians on their nuclear program — the size of it, how far advanced it’s gone, the fact that they already have fuel for weapons and maybe some weapons themselves. So you have to think of the North Koreans here as sort of the poor relation that has wrapped the whole country in sort of barbed wire and threatened that unless we bring them takeout food, they’re going to blow the place up. The Iranians have the money and the power to play a much more subtle game. GREG WINTER. David Sanger, chief Washington correspondent, thanks so much for speaking with us. DAVID SANGER. Thank you, Greg. GREG WINTER. And thanks for listening. I’m Greg Winter of The New York Times. We’ll be back next week with another edition of World View.

North Korea’s decision to shut down its plutonium-producing reactor and admit international inspectors was only the first of several steps it needs to take under the deal it made with the United States and five other countries in February. But that initial progress, confirmed officially yesterday, shows that real nonproliferation diplomacy can produce real results. These two steps are also important in themselves, since they freeze North Korea’s production of the plutonium it could use to build more bombs for itself or help another nation or terrorist group achieve nuclear weapons status. For more than four years, the Bush administration preferred empty, ideological posturing to pragmatic deal-making, with disastrous results. North Korea used the interval to extract enough plutonium to build six nuclear bombs, capped by a nuclear bomb test last October. Such an embarrassing outcome for the hard-line tactics favored by Vice President Dick Cheney created enough of an opening for Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill to negotiate the agreement that led to this weekend’s shutdown. The next steps North Korea needs to take include permanently disabling the plutonium reactor and providing a complete inventory of all its remaining nuclear weapons. The February agreement also commits North Korea to eventually eliminate those nuclear assets, but a timetable for doing that still has not been negotiated. Those commitments go well beyond the requirement of the 1994 deal negotiated by the Clinton administration, inherited by Mr. Bush when he took office. That earlier agreement also froze plutonium production at the reactor and admitted inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the same two steps taken last weekend. But the Bush administration walked away from Mr. Clinton’s deal in 2002, with sensational charges, from which it has since retreated, that North Korea was pursuing a second, secret bomb-making program based on uranium enrichment. The ground lost over the intervening years has now been largely recovered, except, of course for the six bombs’ worth of nuclear fuel Pyongyang produced while Washington strutted and postured.

TOKYO, June 22 — The United States’ chief nuclear negotiator leftNorth Koreatoday after a surprise visit with assurances that Pyongyang would slow down its main nuclear reactor, a move that would fulfill a commitment made in February and help speed six-nation talks aimed at dismantling North Korea’s nuclear program. “I come away from this two-day set of meetings buoyed by a sense that we are going to be able to achieve our full objectives, that is complete denuclearization,” said Assistant Secretary of State Christopher R. Hill, according to The Associated Press. He also warned that “we’re going to have to spend a great deal of time, a great deal of effort, a lot of work in achieving these.” In the first visit to Pyongyang by a senior American official in nearly five years, Mr. Hill met with senior North Korean officials, including his counterpart, Kim Kye-gwan, for one-on-one talks. Mr. Hill spent the night in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, before leaving. Television images showed Mr. Hill being warmly greeted at Pyongyang’s airport by Ri Gun, the North’s deputy nuclear negotiator. “We want to get the six-party process moving,” Mr. Hill said. “We hope that we can make up for some of the time that we lost this spring, and so I’m looking forward to good discussions about that.” Mr. Hill’s trip was organized in such secrecy and so suddenly that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice did not alert regional allies, Japan and South Korea, until just before his departure from Tokyo, where he had been visiting. Mr. Hill flew from Japan to South Korea, and then to Pyongyang aboard a small jet. “We’re all waiting for you,” Mr. Ri told Mr. Hill, as the two could be seen smiling and chatting at the airport. Spent fuel from the main reactor has enabled the country to manufacture plutonium and gain the fuel for eight or more nuclear weapons, according to American intelligence estimates. Next, the North is supposed to provide the United States and the other participants in the six-nation negotiations on the issue — Japan, South Korea, Russia and China — with a detailed list of all of its nuclear programs and facilities. The Bush administration is also considering authorizing Mr. Hill to offer to buy from the North Koreans nuclear equipment that they are believed to have purchased several years ago from Abdul Qadeer Khan, a Pakistani nuclear engineer. That equipment could conceivably give the North a second path to building a bomb by enriching uranium.

In the first visit by a senior U.S. official in nearly five years, America’s chief nuclear negotiator was in Pyongyang today in an effort to speed up nuclear negotiations.

TOKYO, June 21 — The United States’ chief nuclear negotiator began a surprise two-day visit toNorth Koreatoday, saying he wanted to speed up six-nation talks aimed at dismantling North Korea’s nuclear program. In the first visit to Pyongyang by a senior American official in nearly five years, the envoy, Christopher R. Hill, was scheduled to meet senior North Korean officials, including his counterpart, Kim Kye-gwan, for one-on-one talks. Mr. Hill was scheduled to spend the night in the North Korean capital before leaving on Friday. Television footage showed Mr. Hill being greeted at Pyongyang’s airport by Ri Gun, the North’s deputy nuclear negotiator. “We want to get the six-party process moving,” Mr. Hill said. “We hope that we can make up for some of the time that we lost this spring, and so I’m looking forward to good discussions about that.” Mr. Hill’s trip was organized in such secrecy and so suddenly that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice alerted American allies, Japan and South Korea, just prior to his departure from Tokyo, where he had been visiting. Mr. Hill flew from Japan to South Korea, and then to Pyongyang aboard a small jet. “We’re all waiting for you,” Mr. Ri told Mr. Hill, as the two men could be seen smiling and chatting at the airport. Mr. Hill said that he received the invitation on Monday, adding, “We had to work fast to find an airplane.” Mr. Hill’s trip came just hours after the United States found a way to return to the North roughly $25 million in funds that were frozen for several years. The United States had frozen the money, saying it came from counterfeiting and trade in missiles and nuclear equipment. It took months for Washington to clear obstacles preventing the money’s return, a move that hawks in the administration had argued was deeply mistaken. Now Mr. Hill can pursue the next items on his agenda: Persuading North Korea to fulfill a commitment it made in February to slow down its main nuclear reactor, whose spent fuel has enabled the country to manufacture plutonium and gain the fuel for eight or more nuclear weapons, according to public American intelligence estimates. In the next step, the North is supposed to provide the United States and the other participants in the six-party negotiations on the issue — Japan, South Korea, Russia and China — with a detailed list of all of its nuclear programs and facilities. The Bush administration is also considering authorizing Mr. Hill to offer to buy from the North Koreans nuclear equipment that they are believed to have purchased several years ago from Abdul Qadeer Khan, the Pakistani nuclear engineer. That equipment could conceivably give the North a second path to building a bomb, by enriching uranium. But American officials do not know whether the North ever learned the secrets of enrichment, or where enrichment facilities might be. So far, the North has denied that it possesses the equipment. “This is critical to the administration’s plan,” one senior official involved in the North Korea strategy said, “because unless they get their hands on this stuff, there is no way we can argue that we’ve stopped the North from making more nukes.” But it was unclear whether Mr. Hill was prepared to make the offer to the North now, or what form it would take. While Washington or its allies could offer cash for the equipment, they might also promise future deliveries of nuclear fuel to power the civilian nuclear reactors the North insists it needs. Mr. Hill’s trip was organized in such secrecy that he apparently did not convey his plans to top Japanese officials, whom he visited Wednesday in Tokyo. Japan has refused to join the disarmament deal that North Korea signed in February. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said Japan will only consider joining the deal after resolution of the cases of about a dozen Japanese said to have been abducted by North Korea. In confirming reports of Mr. Hill’s trip on Wednesday night — after sidestepping questions during the day to give Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice time to alert the Japanese and other American allies — the State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, cast the trip as “part of the consultations” with all of the countries in the North Korea talks, trying to make it sound routine. But for years the administration has refused to engage one on one with the North Koreans. Ms. Rice had to maneuver around Vice President Dick Cheney, officials said in February, to reach the deal that gives the North hundreds of thousands of tons of fuel oil in return for step-by-step disablement of its facilities. It was exactly the kind of grand bargain the administration had avoided for years, as Mr. Cheney and others argued that the United States should not prolong the life of the North Korean government of Kim Jong-il, but rather seek ways to speed its demise. “Condi knows she needs a big win here,” said a senior administration official who has dealt with her often on North Korea. “They know they are getting nowhere on Iraq, and they probably won’t get far on Iran. She needs to show that she can reduce at least one big threat.” Late last week North Korea invited the return of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, presumably to witness the shutdown of its main nuclear reactor at Yongbyon. Those inspectors were thrown out of the country in late 2002, after American officials confronted the North with evidence that it had sought to cheat on a previous nuclear accord by purchasing from Dr. Khan the centrifuges to enrich uranium. Under the first phase of the accord reached in February, North Korea agreed to shut down the reactor after its frozen funds were returned. In addition, South Korea will deliver 50,000 tons of fuel oil to the energy-starved North after the shutdown is confirmed. Mr. Hill said in Tokyo that the next round of talks should focus on how to carry out the February agreement’s second phase: declaring where the North has hidden decades of secret work, on the way to dismantling it. That is expected to prove even more difficult; several American officials say they did not believe the North would ever give up all of its nuclear program. The last time an American delegation traveled to Pyongyang to negotiate, it ended badly. Mr. Hill’s predecessor, James Kelly, went to Pyongyang in 2002 and opened the talks by telling the North Koreans that the Untied States had evidence they had purchased centrifuges and other equipment, and were breaking a 1994 accord. The Americans said the North first confirmed it had obtained the equipment, then later denied it. That started a confrontation that resulted in a cutoff of American fuel oil supplies to the North. In retaliation, the North ejected the international inspectors and moved its nuclear fuel for what it said was conversion into plutonium. That began a downward spiral of events, culminating in North Korea’s test of a nuclear device last October. Now, some Korea experts say the confrontation was avoidable. But President Bush was focused on Iraq, and his former aides say he was convinced that once Saddam Hussein fell, the North would be intimidated into giving up its weapons.

The North Koreans have a way of making even patient people apoplectic.

It has been more than three weeks since North Korea missed the deadline to shut down its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, but we’ve heard only mild protests from the White House. President Bush, who once declared that he loathed North Korea’s leader,  Kim Jong-il, isn’t eager for another fight these days. Still, the North Koreans have a way of making even patient people apoplectic. In 1994, when Pyongyang first threatened to start churning out plutonium, Brent Scowcroft — the  realpolitik-minded national security adviser for the first President Bush and a vocal opponent of this Iraq war — shocked the foreign policy establishment by calling for a strike on Yongbyon. President Clinton’s advisers also began talking privately about sending in the bombers, and what it would take to evacuate thousands of Americans from Seoul. The issue became moot after former President Jimmy Carter freelanced a compromise that helped freeze all activity at Yongbyon for nearly a decade. That is, until Mr. Bush decided that he could get more from the North Koreans for less. The North Koreans blame the current delay on Washington’s delay in securing the release of their $25 million in frozen bank funds. The Bush administration — which long insisted that the money was ill-gotten gains,  not a bargaining chip — agreed to the unfreezing. But so far international bankers are balking at transferring money that the Treasury Department still says is tainted. That should be a lesson about the perils to come, including more deadlines for Pyongyang to miss and more crisis points for Washington to manage or turn into a showdown. Under the terms of a February deal, the North Koreans had until mid-April to “shut down and seal” Yongbyon’s nuclear facilities. That should take less than a day. Within minutes at the small reactor, technicians can insert control rods that absorb the neutrons from the uranium fuel and stop the chain reaction. The reactor and the nearby reprocessing facility — which chops up spent fuel and chemically separates the plutonium — can then be padlocked. For that, and readmitting international inspectors, Pyongyang has been promised 50,000 tons of fuel oil and improved relations with its neighbors and the United States. Then things quickly get complicated. In the next phase, Pyongyang is supposed to disable “all existing nuclear facilities” with the eventual goals of “abandonment” and “denuclearization.” For that it has been promised 950,000 tons of fuel oil, security guarantees, and a return to international good graces. But the agreement doesn’t say a lot more. Vagueness was apparently the only way to get  North Korea and the White House — who still aren’t sure they want a deal — to sign on. It says nothing about the sequencing of concessions and rewards or what ”disablement’ and “abandonment” and “denuclearization” mean. What makes this especially hard is that nearly all nuclear technology can be diverted to make weapons. That means that there are many North Korean genies, not one, to be wrestled back into the bottle — and a frighteningly large number of ways they can spring back out again. To meet their commitment to disable the Yongbyon reactor, the North Koreans could do something easily reversible like disconnecting cooling pipes, or they could make it a lot harder on themselves by pouring concrete into the tubes that hold the fuel rods in place. The agreement offers no direction. It also doesn’t say what is supposed to happen to the reactor’s 8,000 fuel rods, which contain at least a bomb’s worth of plutonium. The Americans will want them put into stainless steel cans and shipped as quickly as possible out of the country. Nor does it say what should happen to the Koreans’ inventory of separated plutonium or the four to 10 weapons they may have built. Jon Wolfsthal, a former Energy Department aide who spent a month in Yongbyon in the mid-1990s preparing for the canning of fuel rods, says that Washington and its allies are going to have to decide which parts of the program they most want to see gone and what level of irreversibility they will insist on. “The more we ask for, the higher the price the North Koreans will demand,” he said. And then there is the question of whether the North Koreans will come clean about a possible, parallel uranium enrichment program — and how hard Washington will press the issue. The 1994 deal fell apart in 2002 after the Bush administration accused the Koreans of hiding such a program. Since the February agreement, some U.S. officials have suggested that they may have overstated the North’s progress, a suddenly convenient truth for the White House. What there isn’t these days is any serious talk about hitting Yongbyon. That falls off when you are sure an adversary has nuclear weapons. That is why the North Koreans are  likely to keep upping the price for abandoning theirs. And why Mr. Bush and whoever comes after are going to need a lot of international support, a lot of patience, a thick checkbook and a very thick skin.

After accusing North Korea in 2002 of pursuing parallel paths to a nuclear bomb, using plutonium and uranium, U.S. officials are now admitting doubts on the uranium program.
==::==

WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 — Last October, the North Koreans tested their first nuclear device, the fruition of decades of work to make a weapon out of plutonium. For nearly five years, though, the Bush administration, based on intelligence estimates, has accusedNorth Koreaof also pursuing a secret, parallel path to a bomb, using enriched uranium. That accusation, first leveled in the fall of 2002, resulted in the rupture of an already tense relationship: The United States cut off oil supplies, and the North Koreans responded by throwing out international inspectors, building up their plutonium arsenal and, ultimately, producing that first plutonium bomb. But now, American intelligence officials are publicly softening their position, admitting to doubts about how much progress the uranium enrichment program has actually made. The result has been new questions about the Bush administration’s decision to confront North Korea in 2002. “The question now is whether we would be in the position of having to get the North Koreans to give up a sizable arsenal if this had been handled differently,” a senior administration official said this week. The disclosure underscores broader questions about the ability of intelligence agencies to discern the precise status of foreign weapons programs. The original assessment about North Korea came during the same period that the administration was building its case about Iraq’s unconventional weapons programs, which turned out to be based on flawed intelligence. And the new North Korea assessment comes amid debate over intelligence about Iran’s weapons. The public revelation of the intelligence agencies’ doubts, which have been brewing for some time, came almost by happenstance. In a little-noticed exchange on Tuesday at a hearing at the Senate Armed Services Committee, Joseph DeTrani, a longtime intelligence official, told Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island that “we still have confidence that the program is in existence — at the mid-confidence level.” Under the intelligence agencies’ own definitions, that level “means the information is interpreted in various ways, we have alternative views” or it is not fully corroborated. “The administration appears to have made a very costly decision that has resulted in a fourfold increase in the nuclear weapons of North Korea,” Senator Reed said in an interview on Wednesday. “If that was based in part on mixing up North Korea’s ambitions with their accomplishments, it’s important.” Two administration officials, who declined to be identified, suggested that if the administration harbored the same doubts in 2002 that it harbored now, the negotiating strategy for dealing with North Korea might have been different — and the tit-for-tat actions that led to October’s nuclear test could, conceivably, have been avoided. The strongest evidence for the original assessment was Pakistan’s sale to North Korea of upwards of 20 centrifuges, machines that spin fast to convert uranium gas into highly enriched uranium, a main fuel for atom bombs. Officials feared that the North Koreans would use those centrifuges as models to build a vast enrichment complex. But in interviews this week, experts inside and outside the government said that since then, little or no evidence of Korean procurements had emerged to back up those fears. The continuing doubts prompted the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Wednesday to declassify a portion of the most recent, one-page update circulated to top national security officials about the status of North Korea’s uranium program. The assessment, read by two senior intelligence officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity in a joint interview, said the intelligence community still had “high confidence that North Korea has pursued a uranium enrichment capability, which we assess is for a weapon.” It added, they said, that all the government’s intelligence agencies “judge — most with moderate confidence — that this effort continues. The degree of progress towards producing enriched uranium remains unknown, however.” In other words, while the agencies were certain of the initial purchases, confidence in the program’s overall existence appears to have dropped over the years — apparently from high to moderate. It is unclear why the new assessment is being disclosed now. But some officials suggested that  the timing  could be linked to North Korea’s recent agreement to reopen its doors to international arms inspectors. As a result, these officials have said, the intelligence agencies are facing the possibility that their assessments will once again be compared to what is actually found on the ground. “This may be preventative,” one American diplomat said. American intelligence agencies had long known of North Korea’s nuclear program employing plutonium, which can make compact weapons but requires large, easily detected reactors. By contrast, uranium warheads tend to be larger, but the technology for enriching uranium is much smaller and easier to hide. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, declined to discuss the decisions to confront North Korea in 2002 or the quality of the intelligence behind that decision, though both have noted previously that North Korea purchased equipment from Pakistan that could only have been intended for use in producing weapons fuel. One former official said that it was Ms. Rice, in a meeting at theC.I.A.in 2004, who encouraged intelligence officials to soften their assessments of how quickly the North Koreans could produce weapons-usable uranium. “She asked, how did we know about the timing, and they didn’t have answers,” said the former official. “Did they have Russians and Chinese helping them? No one was sure. It was really a guesstimate about timing.” Different players in the 2002 debate have different memories. John R. Bolton, the former American ambassador to the United Nations, who headed the State Department’s proliferation office at the time of the 2002 declaration, said in an interview on Wednesday evening that “there was no dissent at the time, because in the face of the evidence the disputes evaporated.” Mr. Bolton, one of the most hawkish voices in the administration and a vocal critic of its recent deal with North Korea, recalled that even the State Department’s own intelligence arm, which was the most skeptical of the Iraq evidence, “agreed with the consensus opinion.” But David A. Kay, a nuclear expert and former official who in 2003 and 2004 led the American hunt for unconventional arms in Iraq, said he had found the administration’s claims about the North Korean uranium program unpersuasive. “They were driving it way further than the evidence indicated it should go,” he said in an interview. The leap of logic, Dr. Kay added, turned evidence of equipment purchases into “a significant production capability.” But the doubts were on full display on Wednesday, when Christopher R. Hill, the chief American negotiator with North Korea, testified on Capitol Hill. “If we determine that there is a program, it’s got to go,” Mr. Hill said, words that were far more tentative than American policy makers have used about the program in the past. Expressing his resolve to get to the bottom of the mystery, he added: “We cannot have a situation where we — you know, they pretend to disarm and we pretend to believe them. We need to run this into the ground.” He said that while there was no doubt that North Korea had bought centrifuges from Abdul Qadeer Khan, the rogue Pakistani engineer, there was doubt about “how far they’ve gotten.” John E. McLaughlin, a former director of central intelligence and the deputy C.I.A. director in 2002, defended the initial North Korean findings as accurate. “At the time we reported this, we had confidence that they were acquiring materials that could give them the capability to do this down the road,” he said in an interview. But no one, he added, “said they had anything up and running. We also made clear that we did not have a confident understanding of how far along they were.” That confidence has dropped further because inspectors have been banned from North Korea for four years, nearly as long as they were out of Iraq before their readmittance just before the 2003 invasion. In Iraq’s case, intelligence analysts extrapolated from the last information they had to assess what kind of weapons Iraq might be producing. Outside experts, including David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, a private group in Washington that tracks nuclear arms, have suggested in recent days that something similar happened in North Korea’s case. “The evidence doesn’t support the extrapolation” to the judgment that North Korea was making crucial strides in its uranium program, Mr. Albright  said in an interview. “The extrapolation went too far.” He  said administration analysts were right in thinking that Dr. Khan had sold North Korea about 20 centrifuges. Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the Pakistani president, confirmed that in a memoir published last year. But, Mr. Albright said, intelligence agencies overstated whether North Korea had used those few machines as models to construct row upon row of carbon copies. His report zeroed in on thousands of aluminum tubes that the North Koreans bought and tried to buy in the early 2000s. The C.I.A. and the Bush administration, the report said, pointed to these tubes as the “smoking gun” for construction of a large-scale North Korean plant for the enriching of uranium. It was assessments about the purpose of aluminum tubes that were at the center of the flawed Iraq intelligence. In the North Korea case, intelligence analysts saw the tubes as ideal for centrifuges. But Mr. Albright said the relatively weak aluminum tubes were  suitable only for stationary outer casings — not central rotors, which have to be very strong to keep from flying apart while spinning at tremendous speeds. Moreover, he added, the aluminum tubes were “very easy to get and not controlled” by global export authorities because of their potentially harmless nature. So that purchase, by itself, Mr. Albright added, was “not an indicator” of clandestine use for nuclear arms.

The tentative agreement calls for North Korea to start disabling its nuclear facilities and to allow inspectors back in exchange for fuel oil and aid.

==::==
BEIJING, Tuesday, Feb. 13 — The United States and four other nations reached a tentative agreement to provideNorth Koreawith roughly $400 million in fuel oil and aid, in return for the North’s starting to disable its nuclear facilities and allowing nuclear inspectors back into the country, according to American officials who have reviewed the proposed text. While the accord sets a 60-day deadline for North Korea to accomplish those first steps toward disarmament, it leaves until an undefined moment in the future — and to another negotiation — the actual removal of North Korea’s nuclear weapons and the fuel that it has manufactured to produce them. Bush administration officials said they believed that the other nations participating in the talks — China, Japan, South Korea and Russia — would consent to the tentative agreement as soon as Tuesday. The parties still await a final confirmation from the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il. The tentative agreement was forwarded to the respective national capitals Tuesday morning. In essence, if the North agrees to the deal, a country that only four months ago conducted its first nuclear test will have traded away its ability to produce new nuclear fuel in return for immediate energy and other aid. It would still hold on to, for now,  an arsenal that American intelligence officials believe contains more than a half-dozen nuclear weapons or the fuel that is their essential ingredient. The accord also leaves unaddressed the fate of a second and still-unacknowledged nuclear weapons program that the United States accused North Korea of buying from the Pakistani nuclear engineer Abdul Qadeer Khan in the late 1990s, in what appeared to be an effort to circumvent a nuclear freeze the North  negotiated in 1994 with the Clinton administration. Negotiations had appeared near collapse on Sunday over North Korea’s demands for huge shipments of fuel oil and electricity. Under the new tentative agreement, the oil and aid for North Korea would be provided by South Korea, China and the United States — meaning that President Bush would need to win Congressional approval. That proved difficult for the Clinton administration, which constantly fought hawks in Congress over providing fuel oil to the impoverished nation under the earlier accord. Japan has declined to participate in providing oil or aid until it resolves separate issues with North Korea about the abduction of some of its citizens by the North,  American officials said. In Washington on Monday night, administration officials declined to call the first phase of the new agreement a “nuclear freeze.” The term has echoes of the Clinton accord, which Mr. Bush had criticized because it failed to force the North to ship its nuclear fuel out of the country before it received significant aid. The officials insisted that the current agreement was different because the North will not receive light-water nuclear reactors, like the ones it was promised in the 1994 agreement, and because the agreement will also be signed by the North’s immediate neighbors, including China. Beijing was the North’s ally in the Korean War and its protector for decades, but relations have been strained and the Chinese leadership was apparently  pressuring the North to accept the new agreement. “If they renege on this,” said one senior administration official, who would not speak on the record because the deal had not been signed, “they are sticking their fingers into the eyes of the Chinese.” Nonetheless, some administration officials acknowledged that they had concluded that a step-by-step accord was their only choice and that it would be impossible to set a schedule for the North’s disarmament without taking initial steps to build trust. “Everybody had to make some changes to try to narrow the differences,” the chief American negotiator, Christopher R. Hill, told reporters as he returned to his hotel at 2:41 a.m. on Tuesday. Mr. Hill was expected to meet again on Tuesday  in Beijing with envoys from China, South Korea, Japan, Russia and North Korea to learn if each nation has approved the deal. He said he had been in frequent contact with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice during the late-night negotiations and that he believed the Bush administration would support the agreement. “We feel it is an excellent draft,” he said. “I don’t think we are the problem.” If Mr. Hill is correct, it marks a major change of course for an administration that has been beset by six years of virulent internal arguments over whether to negotiate with North Korea or squeeze the government of Mr. Kim until it collapses. Hawks in the administration, including many allies of Vice President Dick Cheney, have opposed any deal that would provide aid to the North before it disgorges its arsenal. Even before the preliminary agreement was signed in Beijing, one of Mr. Cheney’s protégés, John R. Bolton, who left his post as American ambassador to the United Nations just two months ago, denounced the accord. “This is a very bad deal,” he said on CNN, urging President Bush to reject it. He added that “it contradicts fundamental premises of the president’s policy,” and he said that it made the administration “look very weak.” Gary Samore, who was the top nonproliferation official in the Clinton White House and who negotiated with North Korea, commended the Bush administration for negotiating an accord with the North, but said:  “Unfortunately, it is three years, eight bombs and one nuclear test too late. But better late than never.” Under the details of the deal, as described by American and Asian officials, the $400 million in aid  would be disbursed to the North as it meets its initial commitments, probably over the course of a year. The first of those must be completed in the next 60 days, including the “permanent disablement” of the country’s existing nuclear facilities at Yongbyon, its main nuclear complex north of the capital, Pyongyang. The International Atomic Energy Agency, whose inspectors were kicked out of North Korea four years ago, also would need to be invited back in. And the North would have to prepare a “complete declaration” of all its nuclear facilities, turning that over to all of the parties in the talks and the I.A.E.A. That would pave the way for a second phase, in which “working groups” would negotiate the details of disarmament, including turning over weapons and fuel. Other groups would explore normalization of  relations, a peace treaty formally ending the Korean War, and other economic aid in return for disarmament. But the disarmament process promises to be enormously complex, far harder than dismantling Libya’s comparatively small nuclear complex three years ago. Libya never produced nuclear material. North Korea is believed to have made one or two weapons, or the fuel for them, nearly two decades ago, and perhaps a half-dozen or more since 2003. But American officials are uncertain exactly how many weapons the North possesses, and in the second phase of the accord, the North would have to explain what it did with the uranium-enrichment equipment that it is said to have purchased from Dr. Khan. “We don’t know what state that program is in,” one senior official with access to the intelligence information said Monday. “We only know what they appear to have bought,” based in part on Pakistani interrogations of Dr. Khan. United Nations sanctions against North Korea put into place after last year’s nuclear test are expected to remain in effect for the next year, American officials said. Some experts doubt  that the North will ever agree to turn over its weapons, which it considers its main bargaining chip with the West, and Mr. Kim’s only insurance policy against being toppled. “This is a freeze with a promise to negotiate subsequent disarmament,” said Mr. Samore. “And a North Korean promise to negotiate later is pretty worthless.” Mr. Hill acknowledged that he had a lot of negotiating ahead of him. “This is only one phase of denuclearization,” he said. “We’re not done.” If the deal is approved, Mr. Hill added, the new working groups could be quickly established while chief negotiators would likely reconvene in Beijing as soon as next month. He said the tentative agreement would create a succession of deadlines that would need to be met as a precondition of the deal. North Korea had nearly scuttled the negotiations in recent days by insisting on a huge energy aid package. Varying reports in Asia suggested that North Korea had demanded two  million tons of heavy fuel oil and two million kilowatts of electricity in exchange for its approval of any new agreement, far less than it got.

A year after his release, Mr. Newman, who ran afoul of the North Korean authorities on a trip last year, described his detention in a new e-book.

BEIJING — In his 36th-floor hotel room overlooking Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, Merrill Newman developed a routine. He woke at 7:15, ate breakfast at 8 — eggs, toast and two cups of coffee — and then he waited. A nurse and a doctor visited four times a day to take the temperature and blood pressure of the 85-year-old Californian. The interrogator, who sometimes shouted at him, called him a liar and told him to stop acting like a 3-year-old, came less frequently. A year after he was released byNorth Korea, Mr. Newman, a Korean War veteran who ran afoul of the North Korean authorities on a trip there last year, has finally told the story of his detention in an e-book, “The Last P.O.W.” by Mike Chinoy, released this week. A formerUnited States Armyintelligence officer who fought in the Korean War, Mr. Newman was detained by North Korea for more than a month and accused of war crimes. The narrative, based on interviews by Mr. Chinoy, a journalist, portrays the event as the unfortunate result of a collision between a naive 85-year-old and a paranoid state, worried that an elderly, ailing war veteran might be part of some American plot to reignite a 60-year-old conflict. Mr. Newman acknowledges in the book that his war service and his desire to meet relatives of the anti-Communist guerrillas he had helped train were his undoing. Two tour guides who escorted Mr. Newman and an American friend on their sightseeing reported that desire to their superiors, he says in the book. “It was clearly my error to indicate I’d like to make contact with any North Korean survivors” from the war, Mr. Chinoy quotes him saying. The North Koreans detained him at the last moment, escorting him off the plane he had boarded for the flight home. They took him to the Yanggakdo Hotel, a 1,000-room tower on a small island in the center of the capital, where he was held in a guarded suite. The interrogations began the next day, Mr. Chinoy writes. The most explicit piece of evidence against Mr. Newman, in the interrogator’s view, was an e-mail Mr. Newman had sent to some of the veterans of the guerrilla brigade who now live in South Korea. Mr. Newman had asked them if they knew of any colleagues who had stayed behind in North Korea, and whether he could find them. He had shown the email to his two guides. The interrogator, a short, stocky man his 40s, said the email proved Mr. Newman was a spy and accused him of using the tour as a cover, Mr. Chinoy writes. Two weeks after his arrest, he was given a confession to read, a rambling statement with grammatical errors that recounted how he had been involved in killing civilians and destroying “strategic objects.” “You make a confession because you don’t have any choice,” Mr. Newman said in the account. The confession was posted online and a week later Mr. Newman was awakened at 6 a.m. and told to get dressed and prepare for his release. His iPad, cellphone and camera were returned. At the airport, he was given a pair of dark glasses to wear to make him less conspicuous. “People really hate you here,” an interpreter who accompanied him said. “You’d better wear these glasses for the whole trip.” Mr. Newman failed to understand that for the North Koreans the 1950-53 war against the United States had not finished, Mr. Chinoy writes. An armistice remains in place; a formal peace treaty has not been signed. Further, the former intelligence officer was not aware, he says, of the “visceral hatred” the government felt for the Kuwol regiment guerrillas he had helped train and equip, and who are considered as traitors in North Korea. “It seems really stupid now, even having opened that door,” Mr. Newman says in the book. “But at the time it didn’t seem so.” After his release, the North Korean news agency said Mr. Newman had been freed because of his confession, and his “advanced age and health condition.” Soon after he returned, the United States State Department called. North Korea had submitted a bill for $3,241 to the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang for the cost of his hotel room, meals, a $23 phone call to his wife and $3 for a lost plate. Mr. Newman asked if the payment would help free other Americans detained in North Korea. Informed that it would not, Mr. Newman said he declined to pay.

The studio, working with law enforcement agencies, has been exploring whether the hacking was related to one of Sony&#8217;s coming movies, &#8220;The Interview.&#8221;

LOS ANGELES —  Sony Pictures Entertainment and theF.B.I.on Wednesday were seeking more information about an attack that crippled Sony’s computer systems — including whether North Korea, or perhaps a former employee, was responsible. “The investigation continues into this very sophisticated cyberattack,” the studio said in a statement. It added thata news reportby the technology site Re/code, which said that North Korea had been identified as the source of the attack and that the studio planned an imminent announcement, was “not accurate.” Sony was hit by hackers on Nov. 24, resulting in a companywide computer shutdown and the leak of corporate information, including the multimillion-dollar pre-bonus salaries of executives and theSocial Securitynumbers of rank-and-file employees. A group calling itself the Guardians of Peace has taken credit for the attacks. The studio, working with various law enforcement agencies, has been exploring whether the breach was related to one of Sony’s coming movies, “The Interview,” a comedy about two American tabloid TV journalists recruited to assassinate the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. North Korean officials have been sharply critical of the film. On Monday evening, the F.B.I. issued a confidential five-page flash warning to security administrators at American corporations about a recently discovered form of destructive malware. The F.B.I. did not name Sony in the warning, which was obtained by The New York Times, but said that the malware was written in Korean and was “destructive” in nature. It commands a computer to sleep for two hours, after which the computer is shut down, rebooted and directed to start wiping all of its files, the agency said. Meanwhile, a second American company,Deloitte, the consulting and auditing firm, was victimized on Wednesday after the hackers that hit Sony published confidential Deloitte data on Pastebin, an anonymous posting website. The data included salary information for more than 30,000 of its employees. It was not clear whether the data was on Sony’s computer networks because of its work with Deloitte — the entertainment company has hired Deloitte in the past — or whether it was carried over by a former Deloitte employee now working at Sony. The leaked data is likely to raise embarrassing questions about Deloitte’s own insider-threat program. The firm has aggressively marketed its digital threat intelligence services and has been providing advice to corporations about how to protect data from employee leaks. Four months ago, Deloitte sponsored an article in The Wall Street Journal about how companies can more quickly identify employees who take internal data — the very issue it now finds itself addressing. Jonathan Gandal, a Deloitte spokesman, said the company was aware of reports indicating that older Deloitte data may have been taken from a third party, but he said it could not confirm the veracity of the information. Regarding leaked salary information, Mr. Gandal said: “Deloitte has long been recognized as a leader in its commitment to pay equality and all forms of inclusion.” Though most of the speculation about the Sony breach has centered on North Korea, there are other possibilities under investigation, including that the attackwas tied insteadto an employee or former employee. Though online attacks are becoming routine, it is rare for victims to be able to identify their attacker, and even rarer to see a company name them publicly. But the hacking at Sony stands out from the scores of other attacks at American companies in the last year. The attackers did not just steal data, they also defaced Sony’s websites with ominous images of red skeletons and warnings and filled the company’s Twitter feeds with rants. The may have also facilitated the online pirating of five Sony films, including the unreleased “Annie.” Jaime Blasco, a malware researcher at AlienVault, a security company in San Mateo, Calif., said that the attacks were routed through Internet Protocol addresses in Bolivia, Cyprus, Italy, Poland, Thailand and the United States, but that these were most likely hacked systems “that the attackers use to hide their origin.” Mr. Blasco said that the Sony hacker or hackers “clearly had insider information into the company’s system, such as the names of the company’s internal directories and passwords to its internal servers.”

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreasaid on Thursday that the country had no option but to consider another nuclear test after the recent “political provocation” by theUnited Nationsto try to indict the North’s leaders for crimes against humanity. The statement from the North Korean Foreign Ministry came two days after a committee of the United Nations voted on Tuesday toadopt a resolutionthat urged the Security Council to refer the leaders of North Korea to theInternational Criminal Courtfor prosecution for extensive violations of human rights. North Korea has conducted three nuclear tests since 2006,the latest in February last year. Its threat of another test came a day after an American research institute reported that the country might be preparing to reprocess spent nuclear fuel to extract weapons-grade plutonium at its main nuclear complex north of its capital, Pyongyang. The research organization, the Johns Hopkins University’s U.S.-Korea Institute at SAIS, reported on its website38 Northon Wednesday that recent commercial satellite imagery of the North’s Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center showed evidence of a lengthy reactor shutdown. The North last reprocessed spent fuel in 2009, when it undertook a series of moves that raised tensions in the region, including its second nuclear test. China, the North’s main ally, voted against the United Nations resolution and has indicated that it would veto any move at the Security Council to refer the issue to the International Criminal Court. But the mere suggestion that the top North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, could be held accountable in a criminal court has infuriated the North Korean government. On Thursday, it called the resolution a “political provocation,” accusing the United States of hiring “rubber stamps” to pass the document. It said the resolution set a dangerous precedent in “politicizing and internationalizing the issue of human rights” to overthrow an independent country’s government. “The United States’ hostile acts are leaving us no longer able to refrain from conducting a new nuclear test,” said the North Korean statement, which was carried by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency. “Our war deterrent will be strengthened infinitely in the face of the United States’ plot for armed interference and invasion.” In a report on Oct. 3, the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security cited satellite imagery indicating the possible shutdown of a five-megawatt nuclear reactor at Yongbyon for either partial refueling or renovations. Spent fuel from that reactor remains the North’s only known source of plutonium, fuel for its small arsenal of nuclear bombs. In its Wednesday report, the U.S.-Korea Institute cited what it called new evidence, such as steam rising and truck activity, that it said indicated that North Korea was unloading some of the used fuel rods from the reactor and “may be preparing to restart the Radio-chemical Laboratory” at Yongbyon. The laboratory separates weapons-grade plutonium from waste materials from spent nuclear fuel. North Korea restarted the once-mothballed Yongbyon reactor in August last year, after its nuclear disarmament deal with Washington collapsed. Nuclear experts say that after a year of operation, the reactor core could contain up to five kilograms of weapons-grade plutonium, roughly a bomb’s worth of fuel. Historically, North Korea had increased activities at Yongbyon to raise tensions in response to pressure from the United States or the United Nations. In recent months, it has lashed out at efforts at the United Nations to document and condemn what the U.N. called state-sponsored abductions, torture, forced labor, starvation, rape and summary executions in the isolated country that has been ruled by the Kim family for the past seven decades.

I was an English instructor, but what was I really teaching?
==::==
2014-11-02T00:00:00Z
==::==
The student was not interested in small talk. “Have you heard of ‘The Song of General Kim Jong-il’?” he asked. “Yes,” I said cautiously. “What do you think of it?” he asked. I froze. Complete honesty was out of the question. He was a student at Pyongyang University of Science and Technology in North Korea, and I was his teacher. The students and teachers — all evangelicals besides me — were isolated together in a guarded compound, where our classes and movements were watched round the clock. “We Americans have a national anthem,” I replied. “I understand that that particular song is basically your national anthem, and I respect that.” The other two students at the table looked nervous and remained quiet, until one blurted out a question about soccer. But the first student was not deterred. “National assembly — tell me about it.” “Which national assembly?” I said, slightly panicked. “The U.S. Congress? They’re all different.” “Any country, doesn’t matter,” he said. “You are American, so tell me about how it works there.” I took a deep breath and answered in the simplest way I knew. I told him that the United States is made up of 50 states and that the people in those states elect representatives and senators to Congress. We have an elected president too, I said, and the president and Congress have to work with each other to pass laws. So in fact it is the people who make decisions. “But I think the president is the one who should make decisions,” the student fired back. “He has the power, no?” This was the kind of discussion we had been warned against. This student might be trying to trap me, or worse, I might get him in serious trouble. “It’s like this,” I said cautiously. “This entire school is about the students, not its president. It’s the same in our system. Our country is not for the president but the people. The president is just the face, the symbol, but the real power belongs to the people.” What I had just described was, more or less, democracy. I could not read his expression, but he thanked me and excused himself. That evening, I discussed my growing fears about the student’s motives with my teaching assistant. There was nowhere we would not be overheard, so we took a walk around campus, hoping it would look as though we were discussing the day’s lesson, stopping occasionally to take pictures of each other. Maybe, I said, he was on a mission to earn some sort of reward by trading information about us. “But what if that’s not the case?” my assistant asked. “What if he’s genuinely curious?” The second possibility made us both grim. What if we were the instigators of his doubt? What if he was starting to think that everything he had known thus far was a lie? The next day at dinner, a student near my table leaned in and said, “My roommate, the one you talked to yesterday — he’s with you.” “He’s with me?” I asked, haltingly. “Yes, he thinks like you,” he said shyly. That night I lay awake, anxious and scared. The student was thirsty for information, not trapping us to make a report. One vocabulary word I had to teach my class was “fleeting.” I would use the phrase “Youth is fleeting,” repeating it aloud in class. But anytime I imagined the gloom of my students’ futures, I shook it off quickly so that I could be exactly and only what was expected of me, an English teacher in Pyongyang. Now, a few years later, their faces come to me, and a motherly feeling overwhelms me. I taught them how to speak English, these children unaware of the world outside. Yet I hope they have forgotten everything and have simply become soldiers of the regime. I do not want to imagine what might happen if they retained my lessons, remembered me, began questioning. I cannot bear the idea that any of my students — my boys who so eagerly shouted: “Good morning, Professor Kim! How are you?” every time I walked into the classroom — might end up somewhere dark and cold, in one of the gulags. The thought keeps me awake at night still.

Why does a dictator with nukes freak out about a James Franco sendup? Because he’s so into movies. Really.
==::==

LONDON — In mid-June, the trailer for Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg’s comedy “The Interview” hit the Internet. The movie, due in October, stars James Franco and Mr. Rogen as an American talk-show host and his producer, recruited to assassinate the North Korean leader,Kim Jong-un, while in Pyongyang to interview him. The trailer features Mr. Franco and Mr. Rogen riding tanks, the actor Randall Park as Kim Jong-un smoking a missile-size cigar, and a discussion, played for laughs, of reported North Korean propaganda claims that none of the Kim leaders defecate. Within days, the North Korean Foreign Ministry slammed the film as “intolerable,” as well as “the most blatant act of terrorism and an act of war,” and threatened “merciless” retaliation if it was released. The next day the North Korean military launched three short-range ballistic missiles into the sea, as if to hint, “See what I mean?” The lesson: Never underestimate the power of marijuana in Hollywood, and phallic jokes about rockets and cigars. It seems absurd for the leader of a nuclear state to be so incensed over an anarchic comedy by the guys who brought you “This Is the End” and “Pineapple Express.” But movies have held inordinate importance in North Korean politics, beginning even before the country’s founding in 1948. One of the earliest actions by Kim Il-sung, called Great Leader, was to create a Soviet-supported national film studio, where he gave filmmakers and crews preferential food rations and housing. His son,Kim Jong-il, called Dear Leader, was a film buff who owned one of the largest private film collections in the world and whose first position of power was in running the regime’s propaganda apparatus, including its film studios. For over 20 years he micromanaged every new North Korean film production, as writer, producer, executive and critic; to his people, he is still known today first and foremost — thanks to propaganda rather than any real talent or skill — as the greatest creative genius inNorth Korea’s history. The Dear Leader was less quick to take offense than his son Kim Jong-un is today — partly because, at least early on, he preferred threats he could follow up on; in those days, North Korean covert operatives still had the know-how to hijack a plane, bomb a state function, and target a South Korean president. Also, taking offense would have been an obvious case of the pot calling the kettle black. Most of his productions treated foreigners, Americans especially, the way Mr. Rogen, Mr. Franco and Mr. Goldberg treat Kim Jong-un: as cartoonish stock baddies. North Korean films of the 1980s are full of Western villains, usually admirals or colonels, with Dr. Evil bald heads and names like Dr. Kelton or Her Majesty’s officer Louis London. These characters all hatched devious schemes to destroy North Korea and take over the world for the White House. As North Korea had no Western actors to speak of, they were first played by Koreans in heavily caked whiteface makeup. Later on, American defectors and foreign prisoners, diplomats or visiting businessmen were “persuaded” to come into the studio for a day or a week and paste a monocle and fake mustache on for the cameras and dialogue-dubbers. Like Mr. Rogen and Mr. Goldberg’s work, Mr. Kim’s films could be hilarious. But it was always unintentional. North Koreans don’t do comedy. To try and make someone laugh you must be ready for them not to take you seriously, something all three generations of Kim rulers have been unable to do. Where Pyongyang’s propaganda billboards used to threaten war if North Korea was invaded or attacked, now they warn foreigners “not to interfere with our self-respect.” As a character type, Kim Jong-un may be difficult to place: educated in Switzerland, he is a basketball fan and alleged computer nerd; his wife is Pyongyang’s equivalent of Kate Middleton, and there are hopes he may yet open up the Hermit Kingdom — but oops, there he goes again, testing ballistic missiles, executing his own uncle, and letting his press agents call his South Korean counterpart a “filthy comfort woman.” One thing is clear: Mr. Kim deals in perception, not reality. His father and grandfather tried to assert that North Korea was the more legitimate and successful of the two Koreas. That battle was lost a long time ago. Now the grandson and his theater state must act as if his country still has any reason to exist, and so his first job is to sustain that illusion. However, like any person whose keenest concern is not to be laughed at, North Korea has quickly become ridiculous — and, from its position of weakness and impotence, only more prone to take offense. Last year, the North Korean regime issued no threats of war or destruction when the Hollywood action thriller “Olympus Has Fallen” featured North Korean commandos attacking the White House; it had no problem being portrayed as rogue, dangerous or aggressive. But funny — that’s taking it too far. Kim Jong-Il’s movies — and operas, architecture, mosaics, music, news reports, documentaries, stage performances, all of them part of an elaborate propagandistic visual language — built a worldview for his citizens in which North Koreans were both the purest race on earth and the last people bravely resisting Yankee imperialism. The fear, for his son, is that films like “The Interview” are contributing to another narrative: one in which North Korea is laughable and irrelevant. Mr. Rogen and Mr. Franco’s film will not be released in North Korea, but with more and more Chinese bootleg DVDs turning up in rural North Korean markets every day, and with the teenage youth of the North Korean elite spending their holidays in Japan gorging on Western music, cinema and porn, Kim Jong-un and his cronies are surely worried. What will happen to him when the walls separating his people from the rest of the world finally come down, and the North Korean people realize that the Kims were never Great or Dear at all, only an appalling, criminal joke?

Merrill Newman did top-secret work as an Army intelligence officer during the Korean War. On a return visit to the North this fall, he was accused of war crimes and held, then released.
==::==

Merrill Newman, 85, active retiree and intrepid traveler, preferred exotic places to popular ones. He had sailed around the world. He had been to Cuba and the Galápagos Islands. So it was not so odd when he decided that his next journey would be a return to North Korea, where 60 years ago he did top-secret work as a United States Army intelligence officer. The Korean War still echoed within him. In early 1953, he served on the island of Chodo, advising North Korean anti-Communist guerrillas in raids on the mainland. These fighters crossed the Yellow Sea in leaky old junks. They ambushed supply trucks. They stole weapons. They rescued refugees and attacked enemy soldiers and local Communist leaders. Mr. Newman’s wartime years were followed by a successful career, first as a high school teacher and later as an executive for high-tech companies in Silicon Valley. He seems an unlikely person to become a prisoner of war. But on Oct. 26, at the end of a 10-day guided tour, he was pulled from his flight as he was about to leave Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, and accused of war crimes. Last week, North Korea’s state-run news agency released a video of the bespectacled octogenarianreading a stilted “apology”for his “indelible” offenses. Late Friday, that act of contrition appeared to have led to his release and a flight out. He landed in Beijing. “I’m very glad to be on my way home,” Mr. Newman told the Japanese news media at the Beijing airport, Reuters reported. “I feel good, I feel good. I want to go home to see my wife.” The North Korean news agency called the release a humanitarian gesture, saying Mr. Newman had been allowed to leave because of his “sincere repentance” and his “advanced age and health condition.” Just hours earlier, his wife, Lee, had been lamenting his detention in a telephone interview. “This Thanksgiving, Merrill was absent for the first time in 56 years,” she said from the couple’s home in Palo Alto, Calif. Some expressed amazement that Mr. Newman traveled to North Korea. But Mr. Newman’s son, Jeff, who is in the real estate business in Los Angeles, said in a telephone interview that he did not find it curious when his father decided to go with a neighbor from their retirement community. “Why did my dad go to North Korea?” he asked. “It’s just like a lot of Vietnam veterans who have gone back to Vietnam and World War II guys going to Normandy.” He said his father grew up in Colusa, Calif., a small farm town on the Sacramento River. “It was a 3,000-person town, Depression, make-do,” he said. “He became a guy who could fix things, make things. As an example, when he and Mom got married, he built the bed and the drawer set for their house.” Merrill Newman majored in zoology at the University of California, Berkeley. He was drafted into the Army. He attended Stanford on the G.I. Bill. Years later, he got an M.B.A., going to night classes at Santa Clara University for seven years, his son said. He thrived as a financial officer for several companies, earning enough to afford a second home near the beach in Santa Cruz, Calif. The Newmans have spent most of their lives in Palo Alto. He retired from full-time work in 1984, but that hardly slowed him down. He sailed to the South Pacific and sub-Saharan Africa. He is an avid scuba diver. He taught swimming. He was a board member of the local chapter of the Red Cross. He was a trustee at the First Congregational Church. Two years ago, the Newmans moved into an apartment in a 10-story retirement community. But Mr. Newman, like many former servicemen, clung to the past as well. He kept a gold ring given him by the guerrillas, a reminder, he wrote, of “old comrades and their brave deeds.” Many of those men — farmers, students, persecuted Christians — had eventually found their way to the South. He reconnected with some of them late in life and attended reunions of the so-called Mount Kuwol partisans in Seoul in 2003 and 2010. Thousands of Western tourists now visit North Korea every year, and Mr. Newman decided to be among them. A licensed guided tour — even one monitored by government chaperones — might well satisfy much of his curiosity. He might even visit Mount Kuwol, where many of his wartime comrades once operated. He began to study the Korean language. But North Korea, a Stalinist dictatorship, is hardly a place where bygones are bygones. “In America, Korea is called the forgotten war because most people don’t know much about it,” saidBruce Cumings, a historian at the University of Chicago. “But the North Koreans are still fighting the war; there’s just an armistice holding it in place. Mr. Newman played right into their hands.” The syntax of Mr. Newman’s “apology” seems far too clumsy for a man with a master’s degree in education from Stanford. But even if coerced, it may offer clues as to how the North Koreans learned of this elderly tourist’s war record. Mr. Newman’s rambling statement said that he had hoped to visit Mount Kuwol to “pray for the souls” of dead comrades and perhaps find some surviving ones, who had escaped from the North to the South: “So I asked the guide to help me look for their families and relatives living in D.P.R.K., and I gave a document written with their address and email address to the guide in the Yanggakdo Hotel.” D.P.R.K. is the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the country’s official name. The confession was accompanied by an email supposedly sent by Mr. Newman on April 19 to friends in South Korea. “I am attempting to plan a trip to North Korea with a visit to Kuwol Mountain in the next few months,” it reads, asking if there were any messages he might deliver or “anyone special I could see.” If genuine, the email would fit snugly into North Korea’s worldview. The government uses every opportunity to portray itself as besieged. Memories of the war, especially the alleged brutalities of American troops, are repeatedly presented in museum displays, political slogans and official diatribes. Propagandists refer to the partisans as the “running dogs” of “bloodthirsty American masters.” “If he really meant to do what he said he would do in his apology, he was greatly mistaken,” said Park Cheon-pyo, 85, one of the 300 or so surviving Kuwol partisans. “To the North Koreans, we are among the worst enemies.” The aging Kuwol veterans sometimes meet in a ramshackle office in Seoul. Some remember Mr. Newman from his recent visits; only a few recall his months as a military adviser. “We ate separately from him and he had his own sleeping quarters,” said Kim Chang-sun, 81. “He gave instructions on training us through our superiors and used to accompany us in some of our operations when we set off on our boats to land on the North Korean side. He himself didn’t land with us, but he watched us from the boat.” Mr. Newman had planned to visit Seoul after his North Korean excursion, taking a flight via Beijing. Some of the Kuwol veterans went out to greet him at the airport on Oct. 27 and were mystified when he failed to get off the plane. Lim Jong-sung, 80, another of the partisans, said he found it difficult to believe Mr. Newman voluntarily confessed to any role in the war. “Why would he?” he wondered aloud. “I think he was tricked by some kind of North Korean scheme. The North Koreans are very good with tricks.” The North Korean Communists invaded South Korea in 1950. Under American leadership, the United Nations joined the conflict in support of the South and pushed the battle lines northward toward Manchuria. China then entered the war, and United Nations troops retreated from positions they had taken in the North. Many of the North Korean anti-Communists who were left behind then fled into the hills, and that was the origin of the partisans. These guerrillas were most active around Mount Kuwol, though they eventually took refuge on islands off North Korea’s western coast, launching attacks from these scattered redoubts. “The U.S. Eighth Army assumed control of the partisans in early 1951 at a time when the war was still active and fluid,” according to American military documents declassified in 1990. The number of guerrillas reached a peak of nearly 23,000. They were supported by 200 to 300 United States military personnel. Lt. Merrill Newman began advising the partisans on Chodo in January 1953. In the text of his “apology,” the retired soldier provided a sloppily worded litany of misdeeds that involve killing civilians and soldiers and destroying “strategic objects.” The text reads: “I realize that I cannot be forgiven for my offensives but I beg for pardon on my knees by apologizing for my offensives sincerely toward the D.P.R.K. government and the Korean people and I want not punish me.” The mere mention of the Kuwol partisans provokes strong emotions in both Koreas. In the North, the guerrillas are thoroughly reviled. In the South, textbooks have portrayed them as heroes. Their story was made into a popular comic book series in 1971. The United States has no diplomatic relations with North Korea. But Mr. Newman was visited by the Swedish ambassador, who assured the captive’s wife and son that he was healthy and being treated well. Mr. Newman was offered a ride back to the United States on Air Force 2 by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who was in the region. The released prisoner said he would prefer to take a direct flight to San Francisco. “I don’t blame him,” Mr. Biden told reporters. “I’d be on that flight, too.” Mr. Biden pointed out that the North Koreans were still holding Kenneth Bae, an American Christian missionary. He was arrested in November 2012 andsentenced to 15 yearsof hard labor for what the government called the hostile act of proselytizing.

SEOUL, South Korea —  Washington’s special envoy on North Korean human rights issues will visit that country on Friday to try to secure the release of an American imprisoned there on charges of plotting to harm the socialist country through his Christian missionary activities, the State Department said on Tuesday. The envoy, Robert King, will travel at the invitation of the North Korean government, the State Department said in a news release. Although the statement characterized Mr. King’s trip as “a humanitarian mission” focused on helping to free the Korean-American, Kenneth Bae, 45, whose health is reportedly deteriorating, analysts will monitor it closely to see if it can lead to a resumption of official dialogue between the United States and North Korea.In an interview with Chosun Sinbo, a pro-North Korean newspaper in Japan, earlier this month, Mr. Bae appealed to Washington to send a high-ranking official to Pyongyang to “apologize” for his crime and help free him. “Ambassador King will request the D.P.R.K. pardon Mr. Bae and grant him special amnesty on humanitarian grounds so that he can be reunited with his family and seek medical treatment,” the State Department said, using the acronym ofNorth Korea’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Mr. Bae, 45, was leading a group of visitors from China into the special economic zone of Rason in northeastern North Koreawhen he was arrested last November. He was sent to a labor camp in May, shortly after he was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for what the North Korean authorities said were hostile acts against the government. Mr. Bae was recently moved to a hospital in Pyongyang. North Korean officials had accused Mr. Bae, a Christian missionary, of flouting the country’s laws on proselytizing. In the Chosun Sinbo interview, Mr. Bae said he had “violated” North Korean laws. In a videotapedsermonhe gave at a St. Louis church in 2011, Mr. Bae said he was a missionary trying to build a covert proselytizing operation in Rason, using a tour business as a front. “We were like Christ’s soldiers entering the country,” he said of a group of 23 Christians from around the world he took to Rason in August 2011 under a “cultural tour” program he had begun in an agreement with the North Korean authorities. He said he had been taking “several short-term missionary teams into North Korea, hoping that the walls will come crumbing down if many people set foot there, pray and shout.” Mr. Bae said he took them to the North to “praise Jehovah as the greatest God in a land that is filled with idols, denies God and upholds Kim Il-sung as the mightiest.” Mr. Kim was the North’s founding president and is worshiped by North Koreans. In the past, North Korea has detained Americans on criminal charges and used them to gain visits by prominent United States officials seeking their release, including former PresidentsJimmy CarterandBill Clinton— a practice that Washington says it wants to end. The North also uses such visits for internal propaganda aimed at boosting the image of its own top leaders. The United States had insisted that there would be no serious negotiation with the North until its government showed concrete signs of giving up its program ofnuclear weaponsdevelopment so Mr. King’s visit could be seen as a diplomatic victory for the North, which has been seeking dialogue with Washington. But Mr. King had previously played a low-key role in helping start such dialogue. A visit he made to North Korea in May 2011 helped win the release of another Korean-American held there on criminal charges. That trip was followed by a series of talks between the United States and the North that led to what was known was the“leap day” agreementon Feb. 29, 2012, in which Washington promised 240,000 tons offood aidand North Korea agreed to place a moratorium on uranium enrichment and nuclear and missile tests. But the agreement quickly collapsed when North Korea launched a long-range rocket in April 2012 and the United States, seeing the launching as a provocative test of missile technology, scrapped the food aid and led efforts at the United Nations to tighten sanctions. North Korealaunched another rocket last Decemberand conducted itsthird nuclear test in February, leading to more sanctions. Mr. King’s trip comes amid signs of a thaw on the Korean Peninsula, as North and South Korea have recently eased tensions by agreeing to reopen a jointly operated industrial complex and resume reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War. A senior Chinese official was also visiting Pyongyang this week to discuss restarting long-stalled multilateral talks on ending the North’s nuclear weapons program.

SEOUL, South Korea —  An American tour operator imprisoned in North Korea on charges of plotting to harm the socialist country through Christian missionary activities has appealed to Washington to send a high-ranking official to North Korea to help free him, according to a videotaped interview made public on Tuesday. The Choson Sinbo, a pro-North Korean newspaper based in Japan, on Tuesday posted thevideoof the tour operator, Kenneth Bae, a Korean-American from Washington State, sitting in a hospital in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, to which he was moved from a labor camp a week ago as his health deteriorated. Mr. Bae, 45, had been imprisoned at the camp since May, shortly after he was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for what the North Korean authorities said were hostile acts against the government. Mr. Bae was leading a group of visitors from China into the special economic zone of Rason in northeastern North Korea whenhe was arrested in November. North Korean officials accused Mr. Bae of being a Christian missionary who flouted the country’s laws on proselytizing. In his interview with The Choson Sinbo, Mr. Bae said he had “violated” North Korean laws. “As an American citizen, I request the U.S. government to make active efforts so I can be pardoned and return home,” he said in the interview, which The Choson Sinbo said took place on Friday. “I think that a high-ranking U.S. official should come here and bring me home, and that such an official should come here as a representative of the U.S. government and apologize and make a request of an early pardon for my release.” It was unclear whether Mr. Bae was speaking of his own free will. North Korea had previously said that Mr. Bae would not be used as a bargaining chip. But outside analysts said recent news of his deteriorating health and the letters he was allowed to send to his family in recent weeks, along with another videotaped interview shown by The Choson Sinbo and CNN last month, were probably efforts by the North Korean government to force Washington to engage in dialogue. In the past, the North has used Americans held on criminal charges to bring about visits by prominent American figures seeking their release, like former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton — a practice that Washington wants to end. A visit by a high-ranking American government representative would be a diplomatic coup for the North Korean government, which has long wanted an official dialogue with the United States. Washington has insisted that there will be no such engagement until the North has shown concrete signs of giving up its nuclear weapons development. In the video posted Tuesday by The Choson Sinbo and broadcast on CNN, Mr. Bae was also shown being visited by a Swedish diplomat. Washington has no official diplomatic ties with North Korea, and the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang represents American interests in Mr. Bae’s case on Washington’s behalf. Mr. Bae appeared gaunt in the video and said his various ailments, including a backache, had worsened during his time in the labor camp. The State Department has called on the North to grant Mr. Bae amnesty and immediate release.

Kenneth Bae, who ran a tour business out of China and was arrested in November, was convicted of committing hostile acts against the government.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreasaid Thursday that its Supreme Court had sentenced an American citizen to 15 years of hard labor for committing hostile acts against its government. The citizen, Kenneth Bae, 44, a Korean-American from Washington State who ran a tour business out of China, was arrested in the special economic zone of Rason in northeastern North Korea in November after leading a group of businessmen there from Yanji, China. On Saturday, the North saidit was indicting himon charges that he tried to overthrow Pyongyang’s government. On Thursday, the North’s official Korean Central News Agency said the Supreme Court had sentenced Mr. Bae during a hearing Tuesday. The court convicted him of “hostile acts,” a charge less grave than the original charge that prosecutors pressed. The crime of trying to overthrow the government could have resulted in the death penalty. Under North Korean law, Mr. Bae should be transferred to a labor camp within 10 days of the ruling. The ruling came amid high tensions between Pyongyang and Washington and could complicate Washington’s diplomatic balancing act as it tries to hold a tough line with North Korea over its nuclear program. South Korean human rights advocates have said that Mr. Bae not only ran tours to North Korea but also was interested in helping orphans there. They said security officials in the North may have been offended by pictures of orphans that Mr. Bae had taken and stored in his computer. North Korea has often used the plight of detained Americans as a bargaining chip in its dealings with Washington. Some were freed only after former American presidents traveled to the North to seek their release. In 2009, North Korea arrested two American journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, who it said had entered illegally and committed “hostile acts.” They were sentenced to 12 years of hard labor, but were released five months later, after former President Bill Clinton visited Pyongyang, the North’s capital, and met with Kim Jong-il, the leader at the time. The North has been locked in a standoff with the United States and South Korea since detonating a nuclear bomb in February. Some analysts say the nation’s leader,Kim Jong-un, may be chafing at his inability to shift those two countries, which have refused to offer the North aid in order to relieve tensions, from their tough stance. In January, Bill Richardson, a former American ambassador to the United Nations, tried to see Mr. Bae during a private trip to the North, but he said the government had rebuffed him.

North Korea’s Musudan missile threatens the security of America and its allies. President Obama should order a narrow, defensive strike before it’s launched.
==::==
2013-04-13T00:00:00Z
==::==
AUSTIN, Tex. SINCE February, the North Korean government has followed one threatening move with another. The spiral began with an underground nuclear test. Then the North declared the armistice that ended the Korean War invalid. The young dictator Kim Jong-un followed with a flurry of threats to attack civilian targets in South Korea, Japan and the United States. Earlier this week,North Koreaclosed the Kaesong Industrial Complex, the only facility where citizens from North and South Korea work together. And now the North is openly threatening (and visibly preparing) to fire a mobile-launcher-based Musudan missile with a range that could reach many of the places Mr. Kim has menaced in his public statements. American intelligence agencies believe that North Korea is working to prepare even longer-range delivery systems to carry the nuclear warheads already in its arsenal. The Korean crisis has now become a strategic threat to America’s core national interests. The best option is to destroy the North Korean missile on the ground before it is launched. The United States should use a precise airstrike to render the missile and its mobile launcher inoperable. President Obama should state clearly and forthrightly that this is an act of self-defense in response to explicit threats from North Korea and clear evidence of a prepared weapon. He should give the leaders of South Korea, Japan, China and Taiwan advance notice before acting. And he should explain that this is a limited defensive strike on a military target — an operation that poses no threat to civilians — and that America does not intend to bring about regime change. The purpose is to neutralize a clear and present danger. That is all. If North Korea is left to continue its threatening behavior, it will jeopardize the fragile economies of the region and it will encourage South Korea and Japan to develop their ownnuclear weapons— a policy already advocated by hawks in both countries. Most of all, North Korean threats will encourage isolated states across the world to follow suit. The Iranians are certainly watching. If North Korea can use its small nuclear arsenal to blackmail the region with impunity, why shouldn’t the mullahs in Tehran try to do the same? The United States and its allies in East Asia have a legitimate right to self-defense and they have a deep interest in deterring future threats on this scale. Thanks to precise satellite reconnaissance, striking the North Korean missile on the ground would be much easier than after it was launched. Since the United States cannot possibly know the missile’s trajectory before a launch, and Mr. Kim has said he is targeting America and its allies, we have reason to believe that civilians face serious danger. Since a missile on the ground is an obvious and largely undefended target, we can be reasonably sure that a strike would destroy it and preserve regional stability and the safety of our allies. An American pre-emptive strike would also re-establish necessary red lines for North Korea and other countries in similar circumstances. As President Xi Jinping of China stated earlier this month, “No one should be allowed to throw a region and even the whole world into chaos for selfish gains.” By eliminating the most recent North Korean missile threat, the United States will reduce the threat posed by the North’s arsenal. The United States would also reassure everyone in the region, and those watching from other parts of the world, that although it is not seeking regime change, America and its allies will not be blackmailed by threatened missile launches. The North Korean government would certainly view the American strike as a provocation, but it is unlikely that Mr. Kim would retaliate by attacking South Korea, as many fear. First, the Chinese government would do everything it could to prevent such a reaction. Even if they oppose an American strike, China’s leaders understand that a full-scale war would be far worse. Second, Mr. Kim would see in the American strike a renewed commitment to the defense of South Korea. Any attack on Seoul would be an act of suicide for him, and he knows that. A war on the Korean Peninsula is unlikely after an American strike, but it is not inconceivable. The North Koreans might continue to escalate, and Mr. Kim might feel obligated to start a war to save face. Under these unfortunate circumstances, the United States and its allies would still be better off fighting a war with North Korea today, when the conflict could still be confined largely to the Korean Peninsula. As North Korea’s actions over the last two months have shown, Mr. Kim’s government is willing to escalate its threats much more rapidly than his father’s regime did. An unending crisis would merely postpone war to a later date, when the damage caused by North Korea would be even greater. China’s role in a potential war on the Korean Peninsula is hard to predict. Beijing will continue to worry about the United States extending its influence up to the Chinese border. If armed hostilities erupt, President Obama should be prepared for direct and close consultations with Chinese leaders to negotiate a postwar settlement, in a larger multinational framework, that respects Beijing’s legitimate security interests in North Korea. The United States has no interest in occupying North Korea. The Chinese are unlikely to pursue an occupation of their own. Destroying the North Korean missile before it is launched is the best of bad options on the Korean Peninsula. A prolonged crisis would undermine regional security and global efforts to stop nuclear proliferation. And a future war would be much worse. The most prudent move is to eliminate the most imminent military threat in self-defense, establish clear and reasonable limits on future belligerence, and maintain allied unity for stability — not forced regime change — in the region. This is the kind of pre-emptive action that would save lives and maybe even preserve the uneasy peace on the Korean Peninsula.

South Korean analysts said a meeting of North Korea’s Parliament later this month may officially introduce Kim Jong-un’s program to revitalize his country’s moribund economy.

==::==
SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreasaid Wednesday that it would convene its Parliament this month, an unusual session that South Korean analysts said might officially introduce a program by the country’s leader,Kim Jong-un, to revitalize the nation’s moribund economy. Since taking over the leadership after the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, in December, the younger Mr. Kim has repeatedly emphasized the need to improve the living standards of his impoverished people. He said in April, duringhis first speech, that he would ensure that North Koreans would “never have to tighten their belts again.” Since July, various news reports in South Korea have quoted anonymous sources in the North as saying that Mr. Kim planned to give factories and collective farms incentives aimed at increasing productivity. The state would let farmers keep 30 percent of their yield, the reports said; until now, it is believed that they could sell only a surplus beyond a government-set quota, which was rarely met. Factories would choose what to produce and how to market their wares, splitting any profits with the state and paying their own workers. The changes, tested as pilot projects in selected farms and factories, will eventually be extended to the rest of North Korea and replace the country’s dysfunctional state ration system, these reports said. Such changes, if confirmed, would be the North’s latest — and perhaps boldest — effort to overhaul its economy. A similar effort failed a decade ago. “The coming parliamentary session will be a bellwether on where Kim Jong-un is taking his country’s economy,” said Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea specialist at Dongguk University in Seoul. The announcement by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency that the Supreme People’s Assembly would meet Sept. 25 gave no details as to its agenda. It is rare for the rubber-stamp Parliament to meet more than once a year. It last assembled in April, when legislatorselectedMr. Kim to succeed his father as chairman of the National Defense Commission, the North’s top state agency, the last of the top military, party and state titles he inherited. Besides passing legislation and appointing top government officials, the North Korean legislature also announces important domestic and foreign policies. In 2003, it declared that the country would expand itsnuclear weaponsprogram. On Friday, the North Korean Foreign Ministry vowed to expand the country’s nuclear arsenal “beyond imagination.” The threat came as the International Atomic Energy Agency warned that North Korea was making significant progress in building a new nuclear reactor widely seen as a means to enrich uranium and make weapons-grade plutonium. On Wednesday, the Foreign Ministry said its nuclear program was no longer for “peaceful purposes only” and the country acquired nuclear weapons to cope with the “persistent hostile policy” of the United States. North Korea watchers in the South said that Mr. Kim, who South Korean officials believe to be 28, may retire some of the North’s aging leaders, like Prime Minister Choe Yong-rim and Kim Yong-nam, the president of Parliament, both in their 80s, to put his own stamp on the leadership hierarchy and promote younger technocrats to drive his economic revitalization efforts. The South Korean news reports on Mr. Kim’s economic changes cited North Korean party officials who attended briefings on Mr. Kim’s economic program. They varied in details while agreeing on a rough outline. “The gist is to expand incentives for factories, individuals and collective farms to boost productivity,” said Yoo Ho-yeol, a North Korea specialist at Korea University in Seoul. Within collective farms, groups of four to six workers will be allowed to work as units to encourage competition, according to the Seoul bureau of Radio Free Asia, based in Washington, as well as Web sites in Seoul, which use sources in the North to collect news. Meanwhile, Jang Song-thaek, Mr. Kim’s uncle and key policy adviser, visited China last month and won Beijing’s commitment to help North Korea build two free economic zones on its border. On Tuesday, a senior government official in Seoul, speaking on the condition of anonymity to a group of reporters, confirmed one element of the reported plans. He said the North was taking the lucrative trading rights from its powerful military and returning them to the cabinet. In April, Mr. Kim vowed to make the cabinet “the economic command.” Analysts say that the North’s former army chief, Vice Marshal Ri Yong-ho, wholost all his jobsin July, was fired for resisting an effort by Mr. Kim and Mr. Jang to curtail the military’s economic rights. Analysts in South Korea remained divided over whether Mr. Kim was trying to achieve genuine economic change, of the kind his country’s main ally, China, has pursued, or seeking more productivity only to make up for his dwindling state coffers. The government has found it increasingly hard to earn hard currency in recent years as United Nations sanctions tightened and outside aid dwindled. In a commentary published on the Web site of Sejong Institute of South Korea, Oh Gyeong-seop, an analyst, credited Mr. Kim with “reform within the system,” rather than a shift toward a market economy. His program, as reported so far, “still adheres to the state ownership of properties and bans individuals from establishing their own business enterprises,” he said. Mr. Kim said in April that North Korea should stick to “socialist economic principles” while bolstering production. In July, his government even scoffed at reports of economic changes in North Korea, calling them a “hallucination,” like “expecting the sun to rise from the west.” In August, its main party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, said North Korea might change “tactics” but would never abandon its “strategy” of building a “powerful socialist country.” In 2002, North Korea experimented with similar incentives, but it quickly backtracked when the markets and trading activities boomed and the government saw them as a threat to its near-totalitarian control on the population. In 2009, North Korea again cracked down on markets. Such interference set off runaway inflation and occasional outbursts of protest. Pak Pong-ju, the former North Korean prime minister who was banished for pushing changes too far in 2002, returned to the center of economic policy in 2010. He is supported by Mr. Kim’s aunt and Mr. Jang’s wife, Kim Kyong-hee, whose influence has increased under the young Mr. Kim, according to analysts and officials here. Meanwhile, word of a new round of economic change has created uncertainty among North Koreans, already fueling inflation. The price of rice has doubled since early June, Daily NK reported last week. “Here people think that economic measures mean rising prices,” it quoted a North Korean as saying.

Blaine Harden tells the story of Shin Dong-hyuk, who fled a North Korean forced-labor camp but not before turning in his mother and brother for executions.
==::==
2012-04-12T00:00:00Z
==::==
When Blaine Harden wrote his shocking 2008 profile of Shin Dong-hyuk for The Washington Post, Mr. Shin was living in Seoul, South Korea, and already a published author. He had written “Escape to the Outside World,” a 2007 Korean-language account of his horrific upbringing. Mr. Shin was born in a North Korean forced-labor camp and then found his way to freedom. There were some problems with playing back this account verbatim. So Mr. Harden’s dramatic front-page article,“North Korean Prison Camp Escapee Tells of Horrors, Worries About Those Left Behind,”took care to include a disclaimer: “Shin’s story could not be independently verified, but it has been vetted and vouched for by leading human-rights activists and members of defector organizations in Seoul,” The Post article said. Unfortunately, the disclaimer turned out to be necessary. As Mr. Harden now acknowledges in “Escape From Camp 14,” his blunt, best-selling book about Mr. Shin’s life, Mr. Shin had built his own memoir upon a gigantic lie. In his account Mr. Shin claimed to have been a helpless innocent witness to the execution of his mother and brother when Mr. Shin was only 14. He had indeed been helpless, and he had the torture marks to prove it. But, as Mr. Harden discovered about a year into the interviewing process for this book, Mr. Shin’s original account omitted a crucial detail: He was responsible for the executions. He had snitched to a prison guard about an escape his mother and brother were planning, knowing full well that escape plans were punishable by death. Mr. Shin admitted to Mr. Harden that he had made this trade-off to get more food and an easier job at school. And he said he had done it without regrets. He thought that his mother and brother deserved to die. “In writing this book, I have sometimes struggled to trust him,” Mr. Harden writes understandably in “Escape From Camp 14.” Mr. Harden tries to fathom a cryptic, troubled and not entirely sympathetic young man whose circumstances lend themselves to exaggeration. What’s more, the new book uses dialogue borrowed from Mr. Shin’s disingenuous 2007 version. “Escape From Camp 14” also includes simple line drawings (as Mr. Shin’s book had) that give the most traumatic parts of his story — torture, imprisonment, maiming, executions — the look of action comics. The most benign of these pictures carries this caption: “Children in the camps scavenged constantly for food, eating rats, insects and undigested kernels of corn they found in cow dung.” Readers may well be won over by the sharp, declarative, young-adult style of Mr. Harden’s adventure writing. They will respond to urgent concern about conditions in North Korean prison camps, which are now visible via satellite photographs. And most misgivings about “Escape From Camp 14” will be outweighed by the power of a fast, brutal read. This is not a familiar prison camp story; as Mr. Harden points out, Shin Dong-hyuk is not Elie Wiesel. “God did not disappear or die,” Mr. Harden writes. “Shin had never heard of him.” Mr. Shin did not spend his imprisonment missing love, joy, civilization or comfort, because he had never experienced such things. As the spawn of a “reward marriage” — considered “the ultimate bonus for hard work and reliable snitching” — he had no real family ties. The book says that he regarded his mother as a rival for food and was right to do so; she once beat him with a hoe for eating her lunch. As a young child, he saw schoolmates maimed or even killed for minor transgressions and he learned to obey the camp’s totalitarian rules. Much of this book’s impact comes from its nonstop parade of ghastly details. Mr. Harden writes of how prisoners harvested frozen human excrement — chipped from toilets — to make up for North Korea’s shortage of other fertilizer; how eating rats could help stave off pellagra; how a former North Korean Army officer in another camp, despairing, jumped down a coal mine shaft, hoping to die. But “Shin’s misery never skidded into complete hopelessness,” Mr. Harden writes in typically plain, forthright style. “He had no hope to lose, no past to mourn, no pride to defend. He did not find it degrading to lick soup off the floor. He was not ashamed to beg a guard for forgiveness. It didn’t trouble his conscience to betray a friend for food. These were merely survival skills, not motives for suicide.” Not even the peremptory chopping off of part of Mr. Shin’s middle finger — an event that warrants only two paragraphs in Mr. Harden’s parade of horrors — was enough to set Mr. Shin’s escape plans in motion. What did it was the arrival of a worldly prisoner who made him realize what he was missing. “He explained that the world was round,” the book says of Park Yong Chul, the first person to tell Mr. Shin about a North Korean city called Pyongyang and about what it was like to eat grilled meat. “He fantasized about escaping with Park because he wanted to eat like Park.” The escape provides one of the book’s grisliest stories, which is saying a lot. (Hint: “The human body is unpredictable when it comes to conducting electricity.”) And Mr. Shin finds himself outside the camp, alone. “Escape from Camp 14” follows his steps to China, then Seoul, then California and Seattle and on again (he now lives in Seoul and Washington), but it becomes less certain with each step forward. Just as Mr. Shin, “a scrawny, incurious and for the most part friendless child whose one source of certainty was the guards’ lectures about redemption through snitching,” is not a model prisoner, his is not a model redemption. The book ends on an uncertain note, with Mr. Shin’s delivering a slick, carefully prepared speech about his own ordeal and the urgent need to liberate other North Korean prisoners. “In that speech, if not yet in his life, Shin had seized control of his past,” Mr. Harden writes cautiously. But “Escape From Camp 14” offers no easy answers about how Mr. Shin can deal with a newly guilty conscience, a lack of introspection, a checkered work history and the difficult adjustment to post-traumatic life. He had remarkable powers of endurance against the toughest physical torment. Those powers are being tested still.

The White House is trying to play down the propaganda value for North Korea’s leaders and is readying a response, which could include suspending a food-aid agreement.
==::==

WASHINGTON — WithNorth Koreapoised to launch a long-range missile despite a widespread international protest, the Obama administration is trying to play down the propaganda value for North Korea’s leaders and head off criticism of its abortive diplomatic opening to Pyongyang in late February. The White House is readying a blunt response to a launching by North Korea, which will include, as it has warned, the suspension of afood aidagreement announced just six weeks ago, a senior official said Wednesday. The United States also plans to rally worldwide condemnation of the launching, which Pyongyang insists is intended to put a satellite into orbit, but which Washington says would be a breach of North Korea’s international obligations. Beyond that, however, the administration’s options are limited. The United States will not seek further sanctions in the United Nations Security Council, this official said, because North Korea is already heavily sanctioned and Washington needs to preserve its political capital with China and Russia to win their backing for future measures against Syria and Iran. The more likely scenario at the United Nations is a weaker statement from the Council president. With North Korea telling reporters that it had begun fueling the rocket, the launching appeared imminent, confronting the Obama administration with a new diplomatic crisis after an agreement that American officials had hoped would open a new chapter with a traditionally hostile and unpredictable nation. White House officials moved aggressively to deflect criticism of that deal, which offered North Korea food aid in return for a pledge to suspend work on its uranium enrichment program and to allow  international inspectors into the country. Unlike the administration of President George W. Bush, this official said, the Obama administration did not give the North Koreans anything before they violated the agreement by announcing plans to go ahead with the satellite launching. And, he added, the administration expects the North Koreans to abide by the other terms of the deal if it hopes, as it has said, for a fuller diplomatic dialogue. Still, forPresident Obama, who prided himself on not falling into the trap of previous presidents in dealing with North Korea, the diplomatic dead end has been a frustrating episode: proof that a change in leadership in Pyongyang has done nothing to change its penchant for flouting United Nations resolutions, paying no heed to its biggest patron, China, and reneging on deals with the United States. Moreover, administration officials said they feared that the missile launching could be the first in a series of provocations, which could include the test of a nuclear bomb possibly fueled by highly enriched uranium. A nuclear test would almost certainly force the administration to go to the Security Council, they said. “North Korea should stop engaging in these types of provocative and destabilizing actions,” said a spokesman for the National Security Council, Tommy Vietor. “We’d like to see nations that have close relations with North Korea consider what else they could do to send a clear signal to this new leadership that it’s time for them to move in a different direction.” At a nuclear summit meeting in South Korea two weeks ago, Mr. Obama leaned on China’s president, Hu Jintao, to use his leverage to stop the launching. While administration officials said the Chinese were angry with Pyongyang and conveyed that message, it appeared to have not been enough to deter North Korea from a launching it says is intended to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il-sung, the revered father of the country. On Wednesday, Kim’s grandson, Kim Jong-un, was named to the nation’s top political post in a meeting of the Workers’ Party, tightening his grip on power during a week of events marking the anniversary. North Korea has invited dozens of foreign journalists to cover the festivities, including the satellite launching. The White House has urged media organizations not to overdo their coverage, saying it would give Pyongyang a propaganda victory. The satellite, one official said, was a “dishwasher wrapped in tinfoil.” But that has not stopped news organizations from sending correspondents to Pyongyang, where they have filed frequent reports on preparations. For weeks, the administration has had to contend with whispers from Korea experts that somehow its diplomats were duped, or that the Americans did not issue a clear enough warning to the North Koreans that a launching would be unacceptable — a narrative that the North Koreans have helped to propagate. But according to Evans Revere, a former principal deputy assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific affairs at the State Department, the new State Department negotiator for North Korea, Glyn Davies, told the North Koreans that a satellite launching would be a violation of whatever agreement they made, when he sat opposite a veteran North Korean diplomat, Kim Kye-gwan, in late February. “Administration officials have told me that the D.P.R.K. side understood clearly and accepted the U.S. position that a satellite launch would be violation of the Feb. 29 agreement’s ban on long-range missile tests,” Mr. Revere said, using the acronym for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Mr. Revere said he had been told by North Korean contacts as early as December that the government planned to launch a satellite. The information was so alarming that he passed it to the administration before Mr. Davies traveled to Beijing to meet Mr. Kim, Mr. Revere said. The North Korean negotiator left Beijing knowing that if a satellite launching went ahead, the accord would not last, he said. Putting a best face on the North Korean disregard for the Feb. 29 agreement, an Asian diplomat with long experience in dealing with North Korea, who requested anonymity to preserve relations with officials in Pyongyang, said it was possible that Mr. Kim, a Foreign Ministry official, was not told of the North Korean’s military plans for a satellite missile launching. Some analysts question why the Obama administration did not insist on written assurances from North Korea that it would not launch a ballistic missile. Alternatively, the administration could have postponed the agreement to see if the North Koreans went ahead with the launching. “This seems to have been a strategic error that has left the administration with an unpalatable choice of denouncing or only partially enforcing an agreement it recently hailed,” said Douglas Paal, the director of the Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and once an official both in the administrations of President Ronald Reagan and his successor, President George Bush. Analysts expressed sympathy for the administration’s predicament. But some said they thought the political calendar — not just in the United States, but in China and South Korea, which are also facing political transitions — had led countries to relax pressure on North Korea. “Did the administration give a huge amount of aid and get sucker-punched? No,” said Michael Green, who served in the administration of President George W. Bush and is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “But the strategic context matters. Since the beginning of 2011, we have visibly been less urgent about North Korea.”

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreasaid Saturday that its Parliament would convene on April 13 for a session that should give the country’s new leader,Kim Jong-un, an opportunity to further consolidate his grip on power. The parliamentary body, the Supreme People’s Assembly, rubber-stamps official decisions and elects the chairman of the country’s top governing agency, the National Defense Commission. Mr. Kim’s father,Kim Jong-il, led the commission until his death in December. The Assembly also elects the cabinet. Kim Jong-un will probably take over as the commission’s chairman, analysts in Seoul said, or engineer a constitutional revision so that he can leave the post permanently vacant, to honor his father, and create a new ruling agency that he would lead. Either option would require action through the Assembly. The North’s official Korean Central News Agency announced the decision to convene the Assembly but offered no details of the agenda. Earlier, North Korea had said it would convene a conference of the Workers’ Party sometime in mid-April. That meeting is an opportunity for the party to make appointments to top posts that were held by Kim Jong-il: general secretary of the party and chairman of its Central Military Commission. Kim Jong-un, believed to be in his late 20s, has yet to inherit the top state and party posts his father held, and some analysts say that is likely to happen in April. He assumed the other major post, supreme commander of the Korean People’s Army, shortly after his father’s death. In the North, leaders have often convened party and legislative conferences to shuffle government and party officials and to bolster their authority. At the most recent party conference in September 2010, the first in 30 years,Mr. Kim made his debut as his father’s successorand was appointed vice chairman of the party’s Central Military Commission.

North Korea’s surprise announcement raised the possibility of ending an impasse that has allowed its nuclear program to continue for years without international oversight.

WASHINGTON —North Koreaannounced on Wednesday that it would suspend itsnuclear weaponstests and uranium enrichment and allow international inspectors to monitor activities at its main nuclear complex. The surprise announcement raised the possibility of ending a diplomatic impasse that has allowed the country’snuclear programto continue for years without international oversight. The Obama administration called the steps “important, if limited.” But the announcement seemed to signal that North Korea’s new leader,Kim Jong-un, is at least willing to consider a return to negotiations and to engage with the United States, which pledged in exchange to ship tons offood aidto the isolated, impoverished nation. A freeze on nuclear activity, if it holds, could significantly ease anxieties over North Korea’s behavior at a time when the Obama administration, in an election year, is focused on halting Iran’s nuclear program and reducing the possibility that Israel could attack Iran. The last significant effort to negotiate a dismantling ofNorth Korea’s nuclear weaponscollapsed in the waning weeks of George W. Bush’s presidency more than three years ago. The United States and other nations have been watching closely to see whether Mr. Kim’s rise to power late last year after the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, would result in a change in North Korean behavior. The signals have been mixed. Only days ago, Mr. Kim delivered a bellicose speech suggesting that he could resort to military actions against South Korea as he consolidated his power. North Korea also agreed to a moratorium on test launchings of long-range missiles, which have in the past inflamed tensions in the region. But joint statements by the State Department and North Korea’s official news agency gave no indication of when substantive negotiations over the country’s nuclear program — involving the United States and North Korea, along with Russia, China, Japan and South Korea — might begin again. North Korea must first arrange with the International Atomic Energy Agency to send its nuclear inspectors, a process that officials said could raise new obstacles and take some time. And senior administration officials cautioned that North Korea still had to show its sincerity before broader discussions could resume. “We’ve made clear that we’re not interested in talks just for the sake and the form of talks,” a State Department official said. North Korea has agreed in the past to halt its nuclear efforts, only to back out and then return to the table before breaking off talks once more with a flurry of accusations against the United States. The North Korean statement appeared to leave wiggle room for doing so again, saying the country would carry out the agreement only “as long as talks proceed fruitfully.” “The United States, I will be quick to add, still has profound concerns,” Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said when she announced the agreement at a House Appropriations Committee hearing on Wednesday. “But on the occasion of Kim Jong-il’s death, I said that it is our hope that the new leadership will choose to guide their nation onto the path of peace by living up to its obligations. Today’s announcement represents a modest first step in the right direction.” Officials and analysts offered different theories about why Mr. Kim’s government’s would agree now to allow inspectors to return, but most said it could prove to be a significant concession. After years of negotiations, North Korea expelled inspectors and went on to test nuclear devices in 2006 and 2009. American intelligence officials believe that the country has enough fuel for six to eight weapons, but the progress of its newly disclosed uranium-enrichment program at the Yongbyon nuclear complex, conducted without international scrutiny, remains unclear. Victor Cha, a senior analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said that the agreement announced Wednesday differed little from previous ones that had failed to produce breakthroughs, but that it was nonetheless significant because the return of inspectors could shed light on the country’s nuclear progress. “We haven’t had any eyes on this program for over five years now,” Mr. Cha said in a telephone interview from South Korea’s capital, Seoul. Some analysts and officials said the agreement might signal that the young and inexperienced Mr. Kim had consolidated power and had the backing of his country’s military. Although administration officials said it was too soon to draw conclusions about Mr. Kim’s intentions, they said there was no doubt that he had directly authorized his negotiators to reach the deal, which the United States first offered in talks last July. An agreement appeared close during a second round of talks, but then the elder Mr. Kim died. Two days of talks in Beijing last week between American and North Korean negotiators, as well as the Chinese, initially appeared to have produced few concrete results. But after the North Koreans returned home, the country’s leaders unexpectedly and rapidly responded. “This was very much in motion before the leadership transition,” said Daryl G. Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington, who called the agreement a welcome step. Other analysts said the agreement allowed Mr. Kim to demonstrate his command and to use his early months in power to improve people’s lives after years of food shortages and a devastating famine. “It helps him show to his people that he is a leader who can deal with the Americans and bring back some practical benefits, namely the food aid,” said Kim Yong-hyun, an analyst at Dongguk University in Seoul. As part of the agreement, the United States said it would send 240,000 metric tons (about 265,000 tons) of food, though it limited the aid to nutritional supplements, rather than the rice and grains that, as two administration officials said, has in previous instances been diverted by the government or the military, or even sold abroad. The aid is expected to be delivered in monthly shipments of 20,000 metric tons over the next year. The United States also insisted on rigorous monitoring to ensure that the aid would be provided to the neediest, especially women and children, many of whom show the stunting effects of chronic malnutrition. In its statement, the State Department said that in exchange, the United States was “prepared to take steps to improve our bilateral relationship in the spirit of mutual respect for sovereignty and equality” and to allow cultural, educational and sports exchanges with North Korea. The State Department official cautioned that the agreements “merely unlock the door” to a resumption of negotiations over North Korea’s nuclear program. “We can’t allow the same patterns of the past to repeat themselves,” the official added. “We can’t allow wasting arguments on topics that are irrelevant to the main challenges we face. And that’s simply going to take a long time to work out.”

The biggest mystery surrounding the elevation of Kim Jong-il’s youngest son is whether he will be able to retain power in the world’s last bastion of hard-line Communism.
==::==

==::==
TOKYO — With the abrupt death of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, the fate of his isolated, nuclear-armed regime has dropped into the hands of his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, who is such an unknown that the world did not even know for sure what he looked like until last year. But the biggest enigma may be whether the younger Mr. Kim will be able to hold onto power in this last bastion of hard-line Communism, much less prevent its impoverished economy from collapsing. For now, the reclusive regime is acting true to form, offering few clues as to what, if any, changes the death of the dictator could bring. It does, however, appear to be offering the first glimmers of an answer to one question that has long dogged North Korea watchers: whether the powerful military and other parts of the nation’s small, privileged ruling elite would go along with the Kim family’s ambitions to extend its dynastic rule to a third generation. Within hours of the announcement on Monday  of his father’s death, North Korea’s ruling Workers Party released a statement calling on the nation to unite “under the leadership of our comrade Kim Jong-un.” The younger Mr. Kim was also named head of the committee that will oversee his father’s funeral on Dec. 28 — a move that some analysts interpreted as evidence that the transfer of power to the son was proceeding smoothly, at least in the first days. Analysts said they expect the funeral to be an elaborate public display, not only of reverence for the deceased leader, but also of national unity behind the new one. “The first test of the new leadership will be its handling of the death itself,” saidJohn Delury, a professor of international studies at Yonsei University in Seoul. Some analysts said Kim Jong-il had used the three years after his first brush with mortality, a stroke in 2008, to successfully build up support for this untested son, who is believed to be in his late 20s. They also said North Korea’s ruling class might also recognize that, at least for now, they have no  choice but to accept the succession: the elder Mr. Kim’s two older sons are seen as lazy playboys, while any move to reject the Kim family could undo the legitimacy of the entire regime. “Kim Jong-il used the years after his stroke to build a consensus among the elite that his son would be the face of North Korea after he was gone,” said Kim Yeon-su, a professor of North Korean studies at the National Defense University in Seoul. He added that this was an easy face to sell: with plump cheeks, short-cropped hair and a hard gaze, Kim Jong-un looks strikingly similar to his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, the regime’s founder, who is still revered as a god. But what happens after the funeral remains anyone’s guess. The only precedent is the last transition in the current ruling dynasty, when Kim Jong-il took over after the 1994 death of his father, Kim Il-sung. In that case, the son observed a three-year period of traditional mourning before formally taking over control of the nation, a move that reflects the regime’s odd mixing of the trappings of ancient Confucian monarchy with a 20th-century Stalinist cult of personality. With the death of Kim Jong-il, most analysts expect the younger Mr. Kim to observe a similar period of mourning, which he will probably use to quickly consolidate his power. While his father had a decade to build support between being named as heir and actually taking power, Kim Jong-un was publicly presented as successor just last year, though analysts say he may have been named within the ruling party in January 2009. He made his first public appearance on last year’s Sept. 9 anniversary of the founding of North Korea, observing a military parade with his father. Masao Okonogi, a specialist on North Korea at Keio University in Tokyo, said that during the new leader’s first few years, North Korea would most likely shy away from confrontation with the United States and its allies, like South Korea. This is what Kim Jong-il did after he replaced his father, said Mr. Okonogi. He seemed to hold out an olive branch by observing a 1994 deal negotiated by his father to freeze construction of two reactors suspected of use in the North’s covert atomic weapons program. The North eventually suspended the deal in 2003, three years before  testing its first nuclear weapon. “Look for Kim Jong-un to make some offer, like to restart the Six-Party talks,” Mr. Okonogi said, referring to stalled multilateral negotiations on dismantling the North’s nuclear weapons. “He’ll need to reduce tensions with the United States in order to buy time.” Given Kim Jong-un’s relatively weak domestic position, Mr. Okonogi and other analysts said some kind of group rule could emerge. Much speculation has centered on whether Kim Jong-il’s apparent second-in-command, his brother-in-law, Jang Song-taek, could emerge as a regent. However, analysts said there were no signs of that on Monday in the propaganda that followed Kim Jong-il’s death. Beyond that, analysts said there are signs that Kim Jong-un has already begun building up an independent if still limited power base, particularly within the military. Last year, the younger Mr. Kim was proclaimed a four-star general by his father, who also named him vice chairman of the National Defense Commission, the country’s most powerful body. Mr. Kim also appeared to burnish his credentials with the military by overseeing the suspected attack last year on a South Korean warship and the artillery bombardment of a border island. Mr. Kim of the National Defense University said that Mr. Kim has also been cultivating his own connections in the North Korean military, including Lt. Gen. Kim Yong-chol, 65, a well-known hard-liner of defense issues and head of military intelligence, who appears to serve as a mentor to the young leader. Some analysts said there are also signs that the new leader has already begun purging senior military staff with a younger generation of officers in their 30s and 40s. “This new generation will be beholden to Kim Jong-un for its power,” said Chang Yong-seok, senior researcher at the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies at Seoul National University. But this could also leave Mr. Kim beholden to the military, which may cast doubt on one of the biggest long-term questions about the new North Korean leadership: whether it will be able to bring some sort of change to the decrepit regime and its failing state-run economy. Still, Mr. Chang and other analysts said a change of generation might bring a re-evaluation of the North’s isolation. They say that growing numbers of North Korean officials are visiting neighboring China to see the success of its three-decade embrace of market economics under an authoritarian regime. Recent visitors to North Korea say there are already signs of a growing commercial links with China, including a new class of wealthy traders and a budding influx of Chinese-made consumer goods. “The new leadership knows it will have to prove its mettle in the first few years,” said Mr. Delury, who visited Pyongyang in September. “Economic reform will be the single biggest challenge it faces.”

Confirming almost anything about the world's most opaque nation is a journalist's nightmare.

BEIJING — North Korea might be struggling with an unprecedented crystal meth epidemic. Reporting a story on the drug trade between North Korea and China, I spoke with dozens of sources: defectors, academics, policemen and even one North Korean crystal meth dealer, and I heard estimates that anywhere from zero to 50 percent of the population have tried the drug. I painted a picture of the drug’s abuse for my article: part escape from the desolation of North Korean life, part medicine in a country with practically no healthcare infrastructure. Yet after months of research I have to admit that I have no idea what is actually happening inside North Korea. Reporting on North Korea, the world’s most opaque nation, is by definition conjecture. The country might be facing another famine, or it might be trying to weaken international support for U.N. sanctions by manufacturing glimpses of starvation. Kim Jong Il might be trying to transfer power to his son, or preparing to share it with his brother-in-law. One Japanese professor believes Kim Jong Il died eight years ago and has been replaced by a body double. North Koreans might watch South Korean DVDs and brim with rebellious hatred for their leader, or love him like the sun. “Anyone who tells you that they know anything for certain about North Korea is either trying to kid you or trying to kid themselves,” said Ralph Cossa, president of the Pacific Forum of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and a longtime North Korea watcher. Why is North Korea an information black hole? Few North Koreans communicate with the outside world. Because even mild criticism of the state could lead to imprisonment or death, those people who do talk express themselves through utopia-tinted glasses . The approximately 20,000 defectors living in South Korea are valuable sources, but North Koreans themselves are kept in the dark about their own country. There seems to be no independent media, news travels sluggishly from one city to another, and the apparent level of secrecy and paranoia is stupefying: Pyongyang bureaucrats have said they do not know what organizations occupy the offices surrounding them. With few exceptions foreigners cannot travel independently through North Korea. In most cases, the ones who can enter the country are not even allowed to explore the streets of Pyongyang. Reporting on sensitive subjects muddies the picture further. I have no idea how many of my U.S. college classmates tried crystal meth, and I spent four years among them in one of the most open societies in the world. So how to judge when a North Korean, recently escaped from that dictatorship of silence, tells me she estimates that 1 out of 10 of her compatriots have consumed a drug, the possession of which might get them killed? The Associated Press recently announced it will be opening a bureau in North Korea; half a dozen independent news stations in Northeast Asia staffed in part by North Koreans smuggle information in and out of the country. One of them, the Japan-based newspaper Rimjin-gang, released a video in late June showing a malnourished soldier saying, “Within my troop of 100 comrades, half of them are malnourished.” The Australian Broadcasting Corporation, which published the video, claimed, “It’s clear that the all-powerful army — once quarantined from food shortages and famine — is starting to go hungry,” and The Atlantic’s Web site concluded, “North Korea is nearing a hunger epidemic.” Yet this only means that one unidentified soldier said half of his unit is malnourished; there is no information on whether he belongs to a remote, second-rate unit operating in the countryside or an elite team coming from Pyongyang. Filming someone in a soldier’s uniform in Appalachia does not allow for sweeping conclusions about the strength of the U.S. Army. Locked in a Stalinist time warp, and with the potential to plunge Asia into war, insight into any aspect of life in North Korea is valuable. While it’s too early to say how much deeper the AP will be able to probe, I’m skeptical: Their reporter recently wrote a story about the country “on the cusp of change,” the same position that countless commentators and observers have found the D.P.R.K. tottering on for the past two decades. The solution is not to limit coverage but to communicate to readers the speculation inherent in reporting on North Korea. My favorite story is from a defector who said that when Kim Jong Il discovered the crystal meth problem in his country in 2003, he decided to blame chemists in Hamheung, the country’s second largest city. Originally, he planned to send them to villages and camps in the North, remote areas seemingly riddled with starvation. But because doing so would destroy the field of chemistry, Kim forgave them. He decided crystal meth would be called a “strong antibiotic.” The drug flourished. Possible, fascinating and like everything else related to life inside North Korea, impossible to confirm.

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said a high-ranking diplomat from the North would be in New York this week in an effort to restart talks stalled since 2008.

==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — A senior North Korean diplomat believed to be an important strategist in his government’s nuclear negotiations with the United States will visit New York this week to discuss restarting talks seeking to end the North’snuclear weaponsprogram, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Sunday. Mrs. Clintonsaid in a statementthat the United States had invited the diplomat,Kim Kye-gwan, the first vice foreign minister, for “an exploratory meeting to determine ifNorth Koreawas prepared to affirm its obligations under” previous international agreements on nuclear disarmament and to “take concrete and irreversible steps toward denuclearization.” In November,the North revealed an industrial-scale plantfor enriching uranium that showed it was gaining new means to make nuclear bombs in addition to its existing plutonium program. The six-nation talks aimed at ending the programcollapsedin 2009 in a dispute over how transparent North Korea’s nuclear programs should be. Since then, the North has escalated tensions on the Korean peninsula with anuclear testand themilitary provocation of the South. The timing of Washington’s invitation to Mr. Kim provides another sign that the countries involved in the talks — which also included China, Russia and Japan — were serious about restarting the negotiations. As the United States and South Korea cautiously move forward, one concern is how to ensure that renewed discussions with the North will not turn into what officials in Seoul term as “talk for talk’s sake.” Years of on-and-off talks that have been marked by recriminations and broken promises have left officials in Seoul unsure whether North Korea is willing to give up its nuclear weapons programs in return for economic and diplomatic rewards, or whether it has simply been using the talks to win economic aid. “We are open to talks with North Korea, but we do not intend to reward the North just for returning to the table,” Mrs. Clinton said. “We will not give them anything new for actions they have already agreed to take. And we have no appetite for pursuing protracted negotiations that will only lead us right back to where we have already been.” On Monday, American officials said the United States was in no rush to restart the talks, despite the invitation to Mr. Kim, Reuters reported. Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell described the meeting as “preliminary” and not necessarily a move toward restarting six-nation talks on the nuclear issue. The South Korean news agency Yonhap said Mr. Kim would probably meet with American diplomats likeStephen W. Bosworth, the special representative for North Korea policy. The two men met in Pyongyang, North Korea, in 2009. Radio Free Asia, based in Washington, said Mr. Kim might also talk withRobert R. King, the special envoy for North Korean human rights issues. United States officials are sensitive about when, where and under what circumstances they meet diplomats from North Korea, since the two countries are still technically at war. The United States is also wary of North Korea’s penchant for snubbing South Korea to negotiate with the United States. Mr. Kim’s trip would followa meeting on Fridaybetween the chief nuclear negotiators of North and South Korea. Wi Sung-lack, the South Korean envoy, met with his newly appointed North Korean counterpart, Ri Yong-ho, during a regional security forum on the Indonesian island of Bali. South Korea has insisted that the North first meet with its negotiators to discuss its nuclear weapons before Washington sits down with the North or the six nations reconvene their talks.

The appointment of Kim Jong-il’s son to a top post, reported by a South Korean newspaper, appears to confirm his status as heir apparent.
==::==
2011-02-17T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — At a time when dynastic rule is under attack in popular uprisings throughout the Middle East, the heir apparent to the North Korean dictatorKim Jong-ilsmoothly acceded to a senior position on the National Defense Commission, the country’s most powerful body, according to a report on Wednesday by a leading newspaper in Seoul. The newspaper, the Chosun Ilbo, citing an unidentified source inNorth Korea, said that Mr. Kim’s youngest son,Kim Jong-un, had cemented his position as the second most powerful person in the country when he was named recently to the post of vice chairman of the defense commission, which is led by his father. The move was announced at a mass gathering of military leaders and security officials on Feb. 10, according to the newspaper’s source, but emerged only Wednesday, as the 69th birthday festivities for the elder Mr. Kim were in full swing in the  capital, Pyongyang. The celebration,typically crowned by a vast turnout of goose-stepping soldiers and dancing, uniformed womenin the city’s central square, was punctuated — as it is every year — by a flower show featuring bright red tuberous begonias calledkimjongilia. Yet the events were marred by the leader’s failure to follow through on a promise of a day’s food to all of the country’s 24 million people, The Associated Press reported. The government may  be saving up for 2012, the centennial of the birth of the country’s founder, Kim Il-sung, and the year the ailing Mr. Kim has heralded as a deadline for building a “powerful, prosperous” nation. Mr. Kim suffered a stroke in 2008 and is thought to have diabetes, kidney failure and cardiovascular problems. The South Korean government marked his 69th birthday by sending “unification balloons” carrying 100,000 propaganda leaflets over the border, a South Korean Web site, theDaily NK, reported. At a ceremony before the launching, a lawmaker with the governing Grand National Party in South Korea, Lee Doo-ah, read a statement saying, “The succession from Kim Jong-il to Kim Jong-un is a violation of the universal and reasonable values of human beings and a tragic act against history.” Just days before Mr. Kim’s birthday, his second son, Kim Jong-chol, 30, was in Singapore attending a concert by the legendary guitarist Eric Clapton, Agence France-Presse and other news outlets reported. Amateur video from the scene showed a young man bearing a strong family resemblance strolling through the venue trailed by men in civilian clothes who tried to shield him from the cameras. Apparently a dedicated fan, Kim Jong-chol attended a series of Clapton concerts in 2006, following the British star to performances in four German cities, A.F.P. reported. The North’s official Korean Central News Agency also said that with the day’s festivities the country was “paying high tribute to the undying feats that General Secretary Kim Jong-il has performed by leading the cause of building a thriving nation to victory.” South Korean government officials could not immediately confirm Kim Jong-un’s promotion, and the North Korean news agency had made no mention of it by Wednesday afternoon. “Kim Jong-un assuming such a position is quite natural, and not surprising,” said Paik Hak-soon, director of the Center for North Korean Studies at the Sejong Institute near Seoul. “It’s not too early for something like this. Sooner or later it was to be expected.” Kim Jong-un, who is believed to be 28 or 29, appeared publicly for the first time at a meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party last fall. He wasgiven the rank of four-star generaland received two significant political posts:membership on the party’s Central Committeeand a vice chairmanship of its Central Military Committee, which is also overseen by his father. Although his emergence as a serious political figure has been undeniable, some political experts had remained unconvinced that Kim Jong-un was secure in his anointed position. But if the report of his promotion to the No. 2 post on the National Defense Commission is true, they said Wednesday, there can be no further doubts. “He is in a very special and unique category, and nobody else can be included as possibly assuming the supreme leadership,” Mr. Paik said. The 15-member defense commission has several vice chairmen, including Jang Song-taek, the leader’s brother-in-law and the younger Mr. Kim’s uncle. It is widely believed that Mr. Jang, the husband of Kim Jong-il’s sister, has effective day-to-day control of the country. But in terms of power and position, “Kim Jong-un is already ahead of Jang Song-taek,” Mr. Paik said. “Jang Song-taek is the most powerful and loyal guardian” for the heir apparent, he said. “But it’s not possible for him to be promoted to supreme leader.” North Korea watchers in the South, lacking reliable and verifiable information about the North’s succession drama, were abuzz recently over television images showing the senior and junior Kims at an art show in Pyongyang: both men were wearing black pants, identical padded and oversize cargo coats and matching brown fur hats.

The return of an official who was banished may signal a renewed openness to economic reforms.
==::==
2010-08-24T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — A former North Korean prime minister who was banished three years ago for pushing market-oriented reforms too far has returned to the center of economic policy, leading to speculation that the nation’s leader, Kim Jong-il, might give such proposals a second chance. The former prime minister, Pak Pong-ju, 71, resurfaced at a state function in the capital, Pyongyang, on Saturday, carrying the title of first deputy director of the central committee of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea, according to the North’s state-run Central Broadcasting Station. He is the latest among senior North Korean officials whose sudden banishment and equally unexpected reinstatement have sparked outside speculation about Mr. Kim’s intentions. Mr. Pak appeared to have fallen from Mr. Kim’s favor when he was fired from the premiership in 2007 and sent to work as a factory manager in a provincial town. “His reinstatement could signal the return of pragmatists and reformists,” said Cheong Seong-chang, aNorth Koreaanalyst in the Sejong Institute south of Seoul. “We may be able to see him push the economic reform and openness he had once championed.” Analysts in Seoul say that few North Korean officials wield much individual influence in Mr. Kim’s government. But they say that they can infer Mr. Kim’s plans from the way he punishes and rewards officials identified with various policy approaches. “Pak’s reinstatement indicates that North Korea is shifting back to market reforms, even if grudgingly, after its botched attempt to re-enforce state control on the economy,” said Baek Seung-joo, the head of North Korea research at the government-financed Korea Institute for Defense Analyses in Seoul. Mr. Pak, a lifetime technocrat, was best known as the architect of “Measures to Improve Economic Management Order.” Issued on July 1, 2002, they indirectly acknowledged the failure of the North’s ration system by instructing factories, collective farms and other economic units to provide their own daily necessities and give incentives for workers. In September 2003 Mr. Pak was made prime minister, a post in charge of carrying out economic policies. His reforms were necessitated by the collapse of the centrally planned economy after a famine in the mid-1990s. But they also coincided with — and fueled — the spread of private markets, which quickly emerged as a key source of food and other necessities for North Koreans. But Mr. Pak’s reform programs irked the government’s old guard, especially in the hard-line military, which had grabbed the lion’s share in trade under the old system. The markets facilitated the influx of DVDs and other smuggled goods the government considered a capitalist threat. Around 2005, North Korea began controlling markets. Its attempt to reinforce state control on the economy peaked late last year whenit replaced its banknotes with a new currency, shut down markets and ordered people to buy goods only from state-run stores. The currency reform was aimed at stifling the markets by drastically reducing traders’ personal wealth in the old currency. Themoves quickly backfired. Inflation surged as traders hoarded their goods and government stores failed to meet demand. Sporadic protests were reported. Earlier this year, Pak Nam-gi, head of finance and planning who led the failed currency reform, was executed, according to South Korean news reports. North Korean markets began coming back to life, according to recent defectors. Pak Pong-ju, the former prime minister,  returns as North Korea prepares for a party caucus early next month. Officials and analysts in Seoul say they will monitor the meeting for changes in the cabinet and party leadership that might provide clues to Mr. Kim’s plans to hand over power to his third son,Kim Jong-un, who is in his late 20s. Mr. Pak’s reinstatement adds to the growing influence of Jang Song-taek, Mr. Kim’s brother-in-law, said Mr. Baek, the researcher. In June, Mr. Kim presided over a session of the rubber-stamp Supreme People’s Assembly where Mr. Jang, a potential caretaker for his son, was elevated to the No. 2 post in the ruling hierarchy. In the same meeting, Mr. Pak’s successor as prime minister, Kim Yong-il, who reportedly made a rare apology in February for the botched currency reform, was fired. Mr. Pak, as first deputy director, is believed to report directly to Kim Kyong-hee, Mr. Kim’s younger sister and Mr. Jang’s wife, who works as party director in charge of the North’s light industries, Mr. Cheong said. Mr. Jang, 64, is widely seen as a main player in ensuring the transfer of power to the leader’s son. He may even head a collective caretaker government if Mr. Kim dies before his son is firmly in control  or is seen as too young to lead a ruling hierarchy that includes generals in their 70s and 80s, analysts said.

Amnesty International interviewed 40 North Korean defectors and heard tales of operations without anesthesia and meals of grass and bark.

SEOUL, South Korea — North Korean doctors perform operations withoutanesthesiain clinics wherehypodermic needlesare not sterilized and sheets are not washed, the human rights groupAmnesty Internationalsaid in areportreleased on Thursday. “Five medical assistants held my arms and legs down to keep me from moving,” the report quoted a 24-year-old North Korean defector as saying, describing how his left leg was amputated without anesthesia after a train accident. “I was in so much pain that I screamed and eventually fainted from pain.” Other defectors told similarly horrific stories. One said her appendix was removed without anesthesia and her hands and feet were bound to prevent her from moving during the procedure. Others told of entire cities with no ambulances. Drawn from interviews with more than 40 North Koreans who had defected over the past six years, as well as with health professionals who had worked with North Koreans, the report depicted a North Korean health system in dire straits. Long cut off from most of the world,North Koreahas been pushing its people even deeper into isolation. Rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula after the North’s nuclear test last year and the North’s presumed role in the sinking of a South Korean warship in March have driven away potential aid donors. The government’s botched currency reform late last year also worsened chronic food shortages in the North. “The North Korean people are in critical need of medical andfood aid,” said Catherine Baber, Amnesty International’s deputy director for the Asia-Pacific. “It is crucial that aid to North Korea is not used as a political football by donor countries.” North Korea claims that it offers free medical service for all its people. But in reality, patients have had to pay their doctors with cash, cigarettes, alcohol and food since the 1990s, the 50-page report said. “Many North Koreans bypass doctors altogether, going straight to the markets to buy medicine, self-medicating according to their own guesswork or the advice of market vendors,” it said. “The North Korean authorities recently banned a highly addictive narcotic painkiller that many North Koreans routinely used as a cure-all.” North Korea spends less on health care than any other country in the world — less than $1 per person per year, according to the World Health Organization. As some North Koreans resorted to eating grass, tree bark and roots, tuberculosis has made a comeback in North Korea, Amnesty International said. For years, North Koreans fleeing their country have told of a deteriorating health care system, especially after the collapse of the economy in the mid-1990s.

North Korea said Friday it would release an American who illegally entered the country on Christmas Day to urge its leader, Kim Jong-il, to resign.

SEOUL —North Koreasaid Friday that it would release Robert Park, a Christian missionary from the United States who illegally entered the country on Christmas Day to urge its leader, Kim Jong-il, to shut down its concentration camps, free all its prisoners and resign. North Korean officials said they “decided to leniently forgive and release him, taking his admission and sincere repentance of his wrongdoings into consideration,” according to a report by the North’s official news agency, K.C.N.A. North Korea hadremained silent about the fate of Mr. Park,28, a Korean-American religious activist from Tucson who disappeared into the isolated nation after walking across a frozen river that makes up part of the border with China. Before his trip, he told friends in Seoul that he would die with political prisoners in the North if Mr. Kim refused to free them. But Mr. Park confessed that he had been wrong about the North after meeting kind North Koreans, the K.C.N.A. report said. “I seriously repent of the wrong I committed, taken in by the West’s false propaganda,” it quoted Mr. Park as saying in an interview. “What I have seen and heard in the North convinced me that I misunderstood it.” The agency said Mr. Park gave the interview voluntarily. There was no indication when he might be released. Mr. Park also was quoted as saying that his prejudices about the North were shattered first by North Korean border guards who protected his human rights and later by the “shocking fact” he learned during a visit to Pongsu Church in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, that freedom of religion was fully protected in the North. “They even returned my Bible to me,” he was quoted as saying. “This fact alone was enough to convince me that there was a complete freedom of religion.” Pongsu Church is widely believed to be fake: The North takes outside visitors there to advertise its claim to religious freedom. Jo Sung-rae, the head of Pax Koreana, a conservative civic group in Seoul that supported Mr. Park’s mission to North Korea, said he believed that the American was coerced to make his statement praising the North. He said that he had heard from sources inside the North that Mr. Park had been severely beaten. When he crossed the border into the North, Mr. Park was carrying statements bitterly criticizing Mr. Kim for human rights violations and calling for his resignation, his friends said. Such criticism is a grave crime in North Korea, one that usually entails a lengthy term in a prison camp, if not immediate execution, according to officials and analysts in Seoul. The North had previously freed American citizens under detention, but usually after high-profile foreign envoys visited Pyongyang. The North’s decision to free Mr. Park without demanding such a visit — which could be used for domestic propaganda — comes as it seeks to draw Washington into bilateral talks. There was no immediate comment from the United States government. Washington does not have diplomatic ties with North Korea and has been working through the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang to gain consular access to Mr. Park. Last month, Robert R. King, President Obama’s envoy on North Korean human rights issues, called the North “one of the worst places in terms of lack of human rights.” North Korea keeps an estimated 160,000 political prisoners in labor camps, according to reports from the United States and South Korean governments. It also punished religious activities, they said.

North Koreaacknowledged that it had detained an American for illegally crossing into its territory from China, the second United States citizen to be held as the North’s dispute with Washington over itsnuclear weaponsprogram continues. The American entered North Korea on Monday and was under interrogation, the North’s state-run news agency, K.C.N.A., said. The other American being held is believed to be Robert Park, a Christian missionary from Arizona.

North Korea put further pressure on the U.S. to start bilateral talks by declaring that it had completed reprocessing its spent nuclear fuel for use in a bomb.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreaput further pressure on the United States to start bilateral talks  by declaring on Tuesday that it had completed reprocessing its spent nuclear fuel for use in  a  bomb. In early September, North Korea had told the United Nations Security Council that it was in the “final phase” of reprocessing 8,000 spent fuel rods unloaded from its nuclear reactor in Yongbyon,  north of Pyongyang, and was “weaponizing” plutonium extracted from the rods. If reprocessed with chemicals, the rods could yield enough plutonium for at least one nuclear  bomb, according to officials and nuclear experts in Seoul and Washington. Using the same procedure at Yongbyon, North Korea was believed to have already accumulated enough plutonium for six to eight bombs. On Monday, the North’s official news agency, K.C.N.A., said that the country  completed reprocessing the 8,000 rods two months ago  and had made “significant achievements” in turning the plutonium into an atomic bomb. “We have no option but to strengthen our self-defense nuclear deterrent in the face of increasing nuclear threats and military provocations from hostile forces,” the  news agency said. North Korea conducted  underground nuclear tests in October 2006 and in May. In April, it also test-fired a long-range rocket. If fully developed, the rocket, known as a Taepodong-2, is feared to have the capacity to deliver a nuclear warhead as far as North America. Those moves resulted in new  United Nations   sanctions. Now, North Korea is trying to draw the United States back to the negotiating table, where its threats to reactivate its Yongbyon nuclear complex and acquire more   bomb material serve as its strongest negotiating tool to obtain humanitarian aid, diplomatic recognition and other rewards. On Monday, North Korea pressed the United States for a decision about starting bilateral talks, warning that it was ready to proceed   with itsnuclear weaponsprogram. North Korea has also  said it was also enriching uranium. Highly-enriched uranium would give it  another route to build nuclear bombs.

Bill Clinton’s trip will have been well worth the effort if it laid the groundwork for truly productive talks on North Korea’s nuclear programs.

Sending a former president to secure the release of two journalists detained by North Korea was a big step, but Bill Clinton’s trip will have been well worth the effort if it laid the groundwork for truly productive talks on North Korea’s nuclear programs. Now it is up to President Obama to make it clear to Pyongyang that it is no longer good enough to make easily broken promises. Even before Mr. Clinton’s mission this week to rescue Laura Ling and Euna Lee from a 12-year sentence to North Korea’s gulag, Obama administration officials concluded that Pyongyang was looking for a face-saving way to re-engage with Washington. North Korea made a colossal mistake by getting off to a bad start with President Obama, who offered the kind of dialogue that President George W. Bush took far too long to embrace. The North Koreans responded by breaking off six-country negotiations, conducting a second nuclear test, and test-firing missiles. They also vowed to make more nuclear weapons and threatened military action against efforts to isolate it, and may have resumed nuclear fuel production. There are growing concerns about Pyongyang’s willingness to sell missiles and other technology to other states. We do not know the details of Mr. Clinton’s meetings, but we hope they lead to future talks. That poses a challenge for Mr. Obama: while he must pursue this opening, he must not be so desperate for a deal that he lets North Korea set all the terms. He struck the right note when he told MSNBC on Wednesday that Mr. Clinton’s mission had not eased the need for North Korea to alter its behavior if it wants a “path to better relations.” To start, that means not giving in to Pyongyang’s desire to make the talks a bilateral process with Washington. It is imperative to keep South Korea, Japan, China and Russia — key participants in any effective deal — engaged. Officials from Washington and Pyongyang can still meet separately, as they did under Mr. Bush. Most important, the United States and its partners need to make clear that the expectations are higher than they were before — that North Korea will not be rewarded again just for recommitting to promises that were broken before and likely will be broken again. Future steps toward disarmament must be irreversible. Under a 2005 agreement, North Korea shut down its reactor at Yongbyon — the source of plutonium for its nuclear weapons — and promised to dismantle its bomb-making infrastructure. It has since kicked out international inspectors and claims to be rebuilding and resuming its capabilities. One way to make disablement more permanent: pour concrete into the reactor core. The United States and its partners also have to re-establish their credibility; North Korea never received all the fuel deliveries promised under the 2005 deal. At the same time, however, Washington and its partners must keep enforcing the tougher Security Council sanctions imposed on Pyongyang in June. It is understandable to doubt that impoverished North Korea will ever abandon its nuclear program — its only form of leverage over the rest of the world. But patient — and firm — engagement backed by sanctions still offers the best path toward a peaceful solution, however tortuous it might be.

Former President Bill Clinton and the two freed journalists were greeted at the airport by family members and Al Gore, who founded the company that employs the journalists.
==::==
2009-08-06T00:00:00Z
==::==
WASHINGTON — Former PresidentBill Clintonarrived in the United States Wednesday morning after a dramatic 20-hour visit toNorth Korea, in which he won the freedom of two American journalists, opened a diplomatic channel to North Korea’s reclusive government and dined with the North’s ailing leader, Kim Jong-il. The private plane carrying Mr. Clinton and the journalists,Laura Ling, 32, andEuna Lee, 36, landed at 5:50 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time at Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, just outside Los Angeles. The two women stepped off the plane in jeans and sweaters, rushing down the stairs to be reunited with their families, who clustered around them. Ms. Lee, in tears, embraced her husband, Michael Saldate, and knelt to hug her 4-year-old daughter, Hana. Ms. Ling kissed her husband, Iain Clayton. Mr. Clinton stepped off the plane a few moments later, embracing former Vice President Al Gore, the founder of the media company that employs the journalists. “Thirty hours ago, Euna Lee and I were prisoners in North Korea,” Ms. Ling said in brief remarks to reporters, blinking back tears. “We feared that at any moment we could be prisoners in a hard labor camp. Then suddenly we were told that we were going to a meeting. “We were taken to a location and when we walked through the doors, we saw standing before us President Bill Clinton,” she said, recounting the final moments of her ordeal. “We were shocked, but we knew instantly in our hearts that the nightmare of our lives was finally coming to an end. And now we stand here home and free.” Mr. Gore then spoke. “President Obama and countless members of his administration have been deeply involved,” in the effort to bring the women home, he said. “To everybody who has played a part in this,” he said, “we are so grateful.” The North Korean government, whichin June sentenced the women to 12 years of hard laborfor illegally entering North Korean territory, announced hours before the jet’s departure from North Korea that it had pardoned the women after Mr. Clinton apologized to Mr. Kim for their actions, according to the North Korean state media. Mr. Clinton’s wife, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, said Wednesday that the administration was “extremely excited” that the women would be reunited with their families. But she denied that her husband had apologized. President Obama, who contacted the families of the women on Tuesday evening, said that he, too, was “extraordinarily relieved” at the journalists’ return. “I want to thank President Bill Clinton — I had a chance to talk to him — for the extraordinary humanitarian effort that resulted in the release of the two journalists,” Mr. Obama said outside the White House on Wednesday morning. Mr. Clinton’s mission to Pyongyang was the most visible by an American in nearly a decade. It came at a time when the United States’ relationship with North Korea had become especially chilled, after North Korea’s test of its second nuclear device in May and a series of missile launchings. It ended a harrowing ordeal for the two women, who were stopped on March 17 by soldiers near North Korea’s border with China while researching a report about women and human trafficking. They faced years of imprisonment in the gulag-like confines of a North Korean prison camp. And it catapulted Mr. Clinton back on to the global stage, on behalf of a president who defeated Mrs. Clinton in a bitter primary campaign last year, and who later asked her to be his secretary of state. Mrs. Clinton was deeply involved in the case, too. She proposed sending various people to Pyongyang — including Mr. Gore — to lobby for the release of the women, before Mr. Clinton emerged as the preferred choice of the North Koreans, people briefed on the talks said. About 10 days ago, these people said, Mr. Gore called Mr. Clinton to ask him to undertake the trip. Mr. Clinton agreed, as long as the Obama administration did not object. In an interview Wednesday with NBC’s “Today” show in Nairobi, Kenya, Mrs. Clinton said the final request to Mr. Clinton had come from the White House. “When the message came to us from the young women themselves, to their families, to former Vice President Gore, and then to the administration that sending my husband would be the best way to ensure their release, of course we took that very seriously, discussed it,” she said, according to a transcript. “The White House reached out, as they said, to my husband, to ask him if he would be willing to do that.” The riveting tableau, of a former president jetting into a diplomatic crisis while his wife was embarking on a tour of Africa in her role as the nation’s chief diplomat, underscored the unique and enduring role of the Clintons, even in the Obama era. At a news conference in Nairobi on Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton said the case of the captured Americans had been handled separately from America’s dispute with North Korea over its nuclear program. “We have been working hard on the release of the two journalists, and we have always considered that a separate issue,” she said. The future of the United States’ relationship with Pyongyang, she continued, was “really up to them.” Mr. Clinton’s trip to Pyongyang came just two weeks after North Korea issued a harsh personal attack on Mrs. Clinton, in response to comments she made comparing its nuclear test and missile launchings to the behavior of an attention-seeking teenager. The North Korean Foreign Ministry objected to her “vulgar remarks” and called her “a funny lady” who was neither intelligent nor diplomatic. “Sometimes she looks like a primary-school girl and sometimes a pensioner going shopping,” a spokesman said. The episode evidently did not stop consideration of sending her husband as an envoy. But the initiative was cloaked in secrecy and came after weeks of back-channel talks between the United States and North Korea through its United Nations mission. In addition to Mr. Gore, the White House’s list of potential candidates included Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico. North Korea signaled its desire to have Mr. Clinton act as a special envoy in conversations with Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee, who relayed that message to their families in the middle of July, according to a senior administration official. The message was passed to Mr. Gore, who contacted the White House, which then explored whether such a mission would be successful. Mr. Obama did not speak directly with Mr. Clinton before the mission. But his national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, contacted the former president to sound him out. The senior official said the administration did “due diligence” with the North Koreans to ensure that if Mr. Clinton went, he would return with the journalists. As president, Mr. Clinton had sent Mr. Kim a letter of condolence on the death of his father, Kim Il-sung, according to a former official. For Mr. Kim, the former official said, freeing the women was a “reciprocal humanitarian gesture.” Mr. Kim is believed to have suffered a stroke last year. American officials said they thought his declining health had set off a succession struggle, complicating the Obama administration’s dealings with the North. The families of the American journalists issued a statement saying they were “overjoyed” by news of the pardon and thanked Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton. “We especially want to thank President Bill Clinton for taking on such an arduous mission and Vice President Al Gore for his tireless efforts to bring Laura and Euna home,” the statement said. Current TVsaid in a statement that it was also “overjoyed” and that the hearts of its employees went out to Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee for “persevering through this horrible experience.” Mr. Clinton and the journalists traveled on a private jet owned by Stephen Bing, a real estate heir and a major Democratic Party contributor, who donated the use of the jet as a favor, said Andy Meyers, the chief executive officer of Shangri-la Industries, which was founded by Mr. Bing. Administration officials said Mr. Clinton went to North Korea as a private citizen, did not carry a message from Mr. Obama for Mr. Kim and had the authority to negotiate only for the women’s release. “This was 100 percent about the journalists,” said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter. “We knew Kim Jong-il would probably seek a meeting with Clinton. But that’s not what this visit was about.” Still, North Korea, clearly seeing a propaganda opportunity at home and a rare chance for a measure of favorable publicity abroad, welcomed Mr. Clinton with the fanfare of a state visit. It broadcast a group portrait, as well as photos of Mr. Kim gesturing and talking to Mr. Clinton; of the former president accepting flowers from a North Korean girl; and of Mr. Clinton, seated across a negotiating table from Mr. Kim, each flanked by  aides. Among those greeting Mr. Clinton at the airport was Kim Kye-gwan, North Korea’s chief nuclear negotiator. Among those accompanying Mr. Clinton was David Straub, a former director of the Korea desk at the State Department, who had held talks with the North Koreans through what is known as the “New York connection.” Also on hand was John Podesta, an informal adviser to the Obama administration who served as Mr. Clinton’s chief of staff in the final years of his presidency, when the former president yearned to travel to North Korea to clinch a deal that would have curbed its nuclear program. That visit never happened — partly because the White House concluded that a deal was not assured — and former President George W. Bush put the brakes on direct talks with North Korea, setting the stage for eight years of largely fruitless efforts to stop the North’s nuclear ambitions. Given Mr. Clinton’s stature and his long interest in the North Korean nuclear issue, experts said it was likely that his discussions in North Korea ranged well beyond obtaining the release of Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee. “It would be someplace between surprising and shocking if there wasn’t some substantive discussion between the former president, who is deeply knowledgeable about the nuclear issue, and Kim Jong-il,” said Robert L. Gallucci, who negotiated with North Korea in the Clinton administration. Mr. Clinton has sought to find the right place in the Obama era, eager to play a role without stepping on the toes of the new president or, certainly, the secretary of state. The last time the two had spoken, said the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, was in March, when Mr. Obama invited Mr. Clinton to a ceremony in Washington for signing legislation expanding the AmeriCorps program created by Mr. Clinton. In interviews last spring, Mr. Clinton said that he would be happy to do anything Mr. Obama asked him to do, but that “I try to stay out of their way.” Mr. Clinton’s mission may be less of an issue for Mr. Obama than for Mrs. Clinton. The same day he landed in North Korea, she arrived in Kenya, beginning an 11-day journey through Africa — a visit now largely eclipsed by her husband’s travels.

Kim Jong-il has pancreatic cancer and the illness is life-threatening, the South Korean broadcaster YTN said.
==::==
2009-07-14T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — The North Korean leaderKim Jong-il, who suffered a stroke last August, was also found to have “life-threatening” pancreatic cancer around the same time, a South Korean cable television network reported on Monday. The network, YTN, a cable news station, quoted unidentified Chinese and South Korean intelligence sources for the report, which was made by YTN’s correspondent in Beijing. The station did not explain how the sources obtained the sensitive medical information fromNorth Korea, an isolated, nuclear-armed state that has kept details of its leader’s health a closely guarded secret. South Korean officials said Monday that they could not confirm the report, but added that they were studying possible causes of Mr. Kim’s recent loss of weight. If the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer were true, Mr. Kim might not have much longer to live. Pancreatic cancer is one of the most difficult cancers to detect early. It spreads rapidly, and the fatality rate is high. The World Health Organization says fewer than 5 percent of patients with pancreatic cancer live longer than five years. Although Mr. Kim began making occasional public appearances a few months after he mysteriously disappeared last August, photographs of him and television images recently carried by the North Korean media showed him limping and frail. Mr. Kim’s loss of weight, in particular, has elevated speculation about the severity and nature of what is wrong with him. The Unification Ministry, a South Korean government agency in charge of relations with North Korea, “has no information” on Mr. Kim’s reported cancer, said Chun Hae-sung, a spokesman. The National Intelligence Service and other government agencies also said they could not confirm it, repeating their standard answer to a recent flurry of thinly sourced and often speculative reports about Mr. Kim’s health. Mr. Kim’s health is a topic of intense international interest, in large part because world leaders and governments are unclear about who would succeed him. North Korea is one of the world’s most unpredictable nations, and any transfer of power will focus new attention on the security of its nuclear arsenal. South Korean news media scrutinized every still photo and segment of television footage of Mr. Kim released by North Korea. In his latest public appearance last Wednesday at a memorial for his father, the founder of North Korea, Kim Il-sung, Mr. Kim looked thinner and appeared to have less hair than before. His mouth looked lopsided. That led to a slew of speculative reports, though Mr. Kim walked on his own into last week’s ceremony. “When I saw his loss of weight, I thought of diabetes or cancer,” said Hyun Jong-jin, a gastroenterologist at Korea University Anam Hospital in Seoul. “But by just looking at him in those pictures, you can not say he has a pancreatic cancer.” Doctors say that a person with chronic diabetes, a smoking habit and obesity is more likely to get pancreatic cancer. Mr. Kim before his reported stroke fits the description. The Seoul government has long suspected Mr. Kim of having diabetes. “We are looking into what his loss of weight means,” said a senior government official in Seoul who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing his department policy. “But if he is a pancreatic cancer patient, he is remarkably doing well because he is making quite a few public appearances.” Mr. Kim has made dozens of visits to military units, farms and factories this year, the Unification Ministry said, citing North Korean news reports. Mr. Kim inherited power after his father died in 1994 at the age of 82. American intelligence officials said last fall that Mr. Kim was seriously ill, although the exact nature of his illness has been a matter of speculation. A French neurosurgeon who has treated Mr. Kim said the North Korean leader did have a stroke last August. In December, the doctor, Francois-Xavier Roux, told Le Figaro, the French daily newspaper: “Kim Jong-il suffered a stroke but did not undergo an operation. He is now better.” In May, North Korea tested its second nuclear device in a move that shocked and angered the international community. Even China, the North’s closest ally, condemned the test. Mr. Kim has three known sons, and in recent months there have been widespread reports — many of them thinly sourced — that the youngest son, Kim Jong-un, has been designated the heir apparent.

The defense secretary warned North Korea that the U.S. will not accept it as a nuclear-armed state.

SINGAPORE — Defense SecretaryRobert M. GateswarnedNorth Koreaon Saturday that the United States would not accept it as anuclear weaponsstate and would consider any transfer of nuclear material to other countries or terrorist groups a “grave threat” to the United States and its allies. “We will not stand idly by as North Korea builds the capability to wreak destruction on any target in the region — or on us,” Mr. Gates told a major security conference here that has been dominated by North Korea’s test this week of a nuclear device and the firing of at least six short-range missiles, all in defiance of international sanctions. North Korea test-fired a missile on Friday, according to a South Korean defense official. North Korea, Mr. Gates said, had a choice: “To continue as a destitute, international pariah, or chart a new course.” Mr. Gates, who was speaking for the first time at the annual conference, called the Shangri-La Dialogue, as an emissary of his new commander in chief, said the new administration had limited patience with North Korea’s bellicose words and behavior. “President Obama has offered an open hand to tyrannies that unclench their fists,” Mr. Gates said. “He is hopeful, but he is not naïve. Likewise, the United States and our allies are open to dialogue, but we will not bend to pressure or provocation.” Military officials traveling with Mr. Gates said the tough talk was aimed at increasing worldwide pressure on North Korea as well as reassuring allies in the region, particularly Japan and South Korea, that the United States was committed to their defense should North Korea make good on talk of war this week. On Wednesday, North Korea threatened military strikes against the South. The officials acknowledged that the United States had only limited information about what was happening inside North Korea and suspected but did not know for certain that its leader, Kim Jong-il, was in the midst of political maneuvers to make his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, his successor. The officials described the country’s leadership as unpredictable and bizarre. Mr. Gates’s sharp language was met with some skepticism by at least one participant in the conference, a Hong Kong television commentator, who in a question-and-answer session after the defense secretary’s formal remarks noted that although Mr. Gates had declared that the United States would not recognize North Korea as a nuclear weapons state, it was already a “de facto nuclear weapons state.” The questioner asked about the next step for the United States and whether the long-running six-nation talks aimed at getting North Korea to abandon its nuclear program had failed. Mr. Gates responded that the next step was political and that the United States would send a team to Asia to “reassess” how to go forward with the talks. He acknowledged, “It would be hard to point to them at this point as an example of success.” Although North Korea was the “hot topic” at the conference, as Mr. Gates put it to reporters on his plane, he also used the forum to appeal to Asian allies for help, both financial and military, with the war in Afghanistan. “I know some in Asia have concluded that Afghanistan does not represent a strategic threat to their countries, owing in part to Afghanistan’s geographic location,” Mr. Gates said. “But the threat from failed or failing states is international in scope.” In representing Mr. Obama, Mr. Gates concluded that the United States, “in our efforts to protect our own freedom, and that of others” had “from time to time made mistakes, including at times being arrogant in dealing with others.” He did not name names, but then said, “We always correct our course.”

North Korea’s state-run media have released a flurry of reports of public appearances by its reclusive leader, Kim Jong-il.

==::==
SEOUL, South Korea —North Korea’s state-run media outlets have released a flurry of reports of public appearances by the North’s reclusive leader,Kim Jong-il, in what analysts on Thursday described as an effort to demonstrate to his people and the outside world that he is firmly in control, despite widespread rumors of ill health. Since Sunday, news outlets in the North have described three separate appearances by Mr. Kim, 66, who officials in Washington and Seoul have said probablysuffered a strokearound August and may have undergone brain surgery. In the latest such report, the North’s official news agency,KCNA, said on Thursday that Mr. Kim had attended a concert, where a state choir and opera groups performed numbers like “Please Receive Our Salute!” Photographs of Mr. Kim that have accompanied these reports have been studied by North Korea watchers in government and media. Aided by neurosurgeons and other experts, they have scrutinized every detail, from Mr. Kim’s facial expressions to background scenery, to gauge his condition. “The reports and release of his pictures are carefully calculated and timed,” said Ryoo Kihl-jae, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. “It’s Kim Jong-il’s way of responding to the intense outside attention to him. He is a man very sensitive to how the outside world views him.” But the photographs have raised as many questions as they have answered. North Korea’s state media did not say when the pictures were taken, confounding the analysts. Undated pictures released on Oct. 11, for example, showed Mr. Kim inspecting a military unit and looking healthy. But they showed green foliage, while trees on the Korean Peninsula at the time were tinged with red and gold. Then, on Sunday, North Korea issued two photos of Mr. Kim, saying he was watching a soccer match. This time, the background vegetation had appropriately autumnal colors. In one picture, he was smiling. The smile, experts said, was symmetrical enough to exclude any serious paralysis of the facial muscles, a common occurrence among people who suffered a stroke. Mr. Kim also had a full head of hair, despite reports that he might have had a brain surgery. But the experts also noted that in both pictures Mr. Kim’s left hand looked immobile, either resting limply on his lap or in a pocket. They also noted that he was not wearing the shoes he usually uses to elevate his short stature. Such details led news media to speculate that Mr. Kim might be suffering paralysis on the left side of his body. On Wednesday, 14 photographs were released that seemed intended to dispel such notions. They showed Mr. Kim walking about and clapping his hands. “The fact that the North is going to such lengths to demonstrate that Kim Jong-il is O.K. is, ironically, a sign that his health is not normal,” Mr. Ryoo said. Other analysts said the timing of recent reports about Mr. Kim was linked to the American presidential election. “Kim Jong-il wants to show that he is in control and that he has no problem being a partner of dialogue with the United States,” said Kim Yong-yun, a North Korea expert at Dongguk University. He suggested that the North Korean leader might soon stage a “foolproof” demonstration of his health, for example by releasing a video of his public activities or paying a courtesy call to the Chinese Embassy in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang. China is North Korea’s main ally.

The chief American negotiator forNorth Koreaextended his talks in Pyongyang, the capital, on Thursday in an effort to salvage a crumbling nuclear disarmament deal, while the South Korean media reported that the North had been upgrading its ballistic missile test site. The unconfirmed reports on the missile base, Musudan, which is on North Korea’s northeast coast, came as the American negotiator, Christopher R. Hill, an assistant secretary of state, met North Korean officials in Pyongyang  to try to persuade them not to restart their nuclear weapons program in Yongbyon. Mr. Hill had been expected to return to Seoul, South Korea, on Thursday, and officials in Seoul declined to speculate on whether the extension of his stay was a sign of progress.

The Berlin Wall might be a thing of the past, but the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea — the world’s most heavily armed border — is still a modern-day phenomenon. Americans who’d like to take a peek behind North Korea’s Iron Curtain, including the zone have a chance to do so this fall with two tours offered by Snow Lion Expeditions (www.snowlion.com), a Salt Lake City-based travel company. “We have a crack in the door for Americans to get in,” said Steve Pastorino, vice president of marketing for the company, who has found a way to procure visas for Americans through a partnership with Koryo, a British consortium of documentary filmmakers and tour guides who work regularly in North Korea. The 11-day tours visit both North and South Korea, using Beijing as a home base. Highlights of the itinerary include attending the Mass Games, a color-coded, athletic performance organized by the state, and visiting sites like Kumsusan Memorial Palace, the mausoleum of Kim Il-Sung. The trip starts at $5,895, including guides, lodging, meals and admission — but not flights.

The White House is split on how long to exercise patience without jeopardizing the fulfillment of an agreement.
==::==

WASHINGTON — A debate is under way within the Bush administration over how long it can exercise patience withNorth Koreawithout jeopardizing the fulfillment of a nuclear agreement that President Bush has claimed as a foreign policy victory. With North Korea sending signals that it may be trying to wait out Mr. Bush’s time in office before making any more concessions, administration officials are grappling with how the United States should react. The debate has fractured along familiar lines, with a handful of national security hawks in Vice President Dick Cheney’s office and at the State Department arguing for a more confrontational approach with Pyongyang. On the other side, Mr. Bush’s lead North Korea nuclear negotiator, Christopher R. Hill, has argued that the United States should continue a more restrained approach, one that is widely credited with bringing about an agreement last year that is intended eventually to lead to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. While the restrained stance still appears to have support from Mr. Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, it is coming under fire from conservative critics, both in and out of the administration. In a public departure from administration policy, Jay Lefkowitz, a conservative lawyer who is Mr. Bush’s envoy on North Korean human rights, said this week the North would likely “remain in its present nuclear status” when the next president took over in January 2009. “North Korea is not serious about disarming in a timely manner,” Mr. Lefkowitz told an audience at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. “We should consider a new approach to North Korea.” At issue is a declaration that North Korea was supposed to make by the end of last year formally stating everything in its nuclear inventory. When the North missed that deadline, administration officials initially sought to minimize the significance of the lapse, but they have expressed increasing concern in the wake of a North Korean statement on Jan. 4, in which the North  insisted that it had already disclosed everything that it needed to. The North has cited a list of nuclear programs that it provided in November, but the United States has rejected the list as incomplete. “Some people make the argument that we’re just pursuing a policy of talks that go nowhere,” said one administration official with knowledge of the debate within the administration. John R. Bolton, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations, argued in a Wall Street Journal op-ed article last week that the Bush administration should dump the nuclear pact with North Korea because, he said, Pyongyang was not interested in giving up its nuclear program. “They’re in the classic North Korean role of deception,” Mr. Bolton said in an interview. “It’s like groundhog day; we’ve lived through this before.” Mr. Bush said the two countries needed to resolve three sticking points: the number of warheads that North Korea has built; the amount of weapons-grade nuclear material produced by North Korea; and the need for North Korea to disclose that it has passed nuclear material to others. The proliferation issue has taken on new importance after an Israeli strike in Syria in September, which American and Israeli officials said was conducted against a nuclear facility near the Euphrates River that was supplied with material from North Korea. Administration officials want North Korea to disclose what help it may have given Syria, although they also say that the help came before the North agreed to dismantle its nuclear reactor and disclose its nuclear programs. Mr. Bolton and other critics of the agreement, including the officials in Mr. Cheney’s office, never liked the pact to begin with, and advocates of the deal with North Korea say their second-guessing is expected. They argue that the Bush administration’s previous confrontational strategy with North Korea is part of what led to the North’s detonation of a nuclear device in October 2006. Besides the United States and North Korea, the other parties to the nuclear pact include China, South Korea, Japan and Russia. “People lambaste the six-party process, and sure, it offers no refuge for those in need of instant gratification,” Mr. Hill, the negotiator, said in an interview. “But when asked for alternatives” to the nuclear pact, Mr. Hill said, “even the noisiest critics fall silent.” Administration officials say that the North has remained true to one part of the October agreement: It has made great strides in disabling and dismantling its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon. “Bush can say, with credit, that he has achieved more than any other administration as far as dismantlement,” said Gary Samore, a vice president at the Council on Foreign Relations who helped negotiate the Clinton administration’s 1994 agreement with North Korea. “He can say that he managed to freeze further production, and handed the next administration a diplomatic process.” But Bush administration officials say that they want more than just dismantlement on their record, and insist that they have not written off their chances of getting North Korea to make a complete declaration of its nuclear programs before the end of the administration. Bush officials say they will not ultimately be able to verify that North Korea has got rid of its nuclear weapons program unless they first know what is in the program. “The issue of the declaration is important because that which they declare must later be abandoned,” a senior administration official said. The official, who asked that his name not be used because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue, said that the administration really wanted North Korea to provide an explanation for purchasing aluminum tubes that could be used to convert uranium gas into nuclear fuel. In its Jan. 4 statement, North Korea accused the United States and the other countries in the six-party talks of reneging on promises made under an October deal, including the shipment of one million tons of fuel and the removal of North Korea from the United States’ list of states that sponsored  terrorism. So far, North Korea has received about 150,000 tons of fuel, and Bush administration officials say the removal of the North from the terrorism list will depend on whether it meets the requirements of the October deal. North Korea agreed in October to dismantle   its nuclear facilities and to disclose all of its past and present nuclear programs by the end of 2007 in return for 950,000 metric tons of fuel oil or its equivalent in economic aid. Last month, Mr. Bush reached out directly for the first time to the North Korean leader,  Kim Jong-il, holding out the prospect of normalized relations with the United States if North Korea fully disclosed all nuclear programs and got rid of its nuclear weapons.

To the Editor: Re “Philharmonic Agrees to Play in North Korea” (front page, Dec. 10): The Philharmonic’s decision to play in Pyongyang is a brazen act that shows how music remains a powerful tool of communication. Let’s hope that this trip will create more room for dialogue between North Korea and the rest of the world. Looking at the long-term benefits, it’s difficult to concur with the arts critic Terry Teachout’s conclusion that the Philharmonic “will be doing little more than participating in a puppet show whose purpose is to lend legitimacy to a despicable regime.” The Philharmonic has more potential to engender mediation than a plethora of pertinacious talk or bombs would. And since this trip is intended to foster openness, in addition to playing Western works the Philharmonic should play some North Korean music. A cup of coffee with Kim Jong-il could turn sour, but North Korean tunes might help enliven the situation. Patrick Kabanda Andover, Mass., Dec. 10, 2007 The writer is the school organist and a music instructor at Phillips Academy.  To the Editor: As the most important orchestra in America, the New York Philharmonic is automatically one of the truly great symbols of Western civilization — a civilization that values reason, science, individual rights and artistic freedom. So it is appalling that the leadership of the Philharmonic has chosen to defile and devalue that great symbol by placing it in the service of one of the world’s bloodiest dictators. As the musicians are giving their usual world-class performance in a comfortable venue, North Korean children will be dying of starvation — a starvation that is the direct and inevitable result of having been denied their inalienable rights by the tyrant Kim Jong-il. There is a disturbing pattern emerging. First, New York University prohibited a student group from displaying the famous Danish cartoons. Then Columbia University invited President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran to visit the campus and present his views in a respected forum. Now we have the New York Philharmonic helping the North Korean regime to paint itself with a thin veneer of civilization. One by one, New York’s institutions are betraying the very culture on which their existence depends. Greg Elmlinger New York, Dec. 10, 2007  To the Editor: While the New York Philharmonic is to be congratulated for its historic coming trip to North Korea, I despair that our cultural policy toward Cuba must remain in the dark ages. When inaugurating the administration’s Global Cultural Initiative, Laura Bush stated that “one of the best ways we can deepen our friendships with the people of all countries is for us to better understand each other’s culture by enjoying each other’s literature, music, films and visual arts.” Our present policies deny such possibilities of friendship and cultural sharing with Cuba, and it’s time to change.

The government granted theWorld Food Programpermission to send four emergency teams to flood-stricken areas, to provide a wider independent assessment of the damage. Margareta Wahlstrom, the deputy emergency relief coordinator at the United Nations, said 58,000 homes had been destroyed along with nearly 222,400 acres of farmland, leaving 300,000 people homeless. She said 83 people were dead and about 60 missing. The United Nations said its relief officials in the region had reported that flood waters had wrecked more than 800 public buildings, 540 bridges, 70 stretches of railway and more than 500 electricity towers. More than 30 water reservoirs and 450 agricultural structures were damaged, it said. World Food Program officials planned to travel today to 10 hard-hit counties to assess immediate needs.

North Korea said that its dispute with the U.S. over $25 million frozen in a bank in Macao had been resolved, and that it would begin to shut down its main nuclear plant.

SEOUL, South Korea, June 25 —North Koreasaid Monday that its dispute with the United States over $25 million frozen in a bank in Macao had been resolved, and that it would begin to carry out its much-delayed promise to shut down its main nuclear plant. The first test of the North Korean commitment to stop and seal its main nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang, the capital, and an adjacent fuel-reprocessing plant, will come when officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency begin five days of negotiations on Tuesday in North Korea. The agency, the United Nations’ nuclear monitoring arm, and North Korean officials  will discuss a timetable for shutting down the reactor and technical details of monitoring and verification. Ever since the first suspicion of a North Korean nuclear weapons program surfaced in the early 1990s,  the agency and North Korea have bickered over how much access the agency should have to  nuclear facilities and data in the isolated country. “As the funds that had been frozen at Macao’s Banco Delta Asia have been transferred as we demanded, the troublesome issue of the frozen funds is finally resolved,” the official North Korean KCNA press agency quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying. “We too will start implementing the Feb. 13 agreement on the principle of action for action.” In the agreement reached in February with the United States and four other countries, North Korea promised to close the Yongbyon nuclear plant, which, according to American intelligence estimates, has produced enough plutonium for as many as a half dozen bombs. To ensure that North Korea keeps its promise, the United States made several concessions. It agreed to release the $25 million in North Korean funds, even though  the United States Treasury had blacklisted the bank in Macao as a main conduit of money-laundering  for North Korea. It also made a point of transferring the money to other North Korean accounts because the North wanted the United States to treat it as part of the international banking system. Then, Christopher R. Hill, the main American negotiator with North Korea on the issue, went to Pyongyang last week in part to show that the Bush administration, which once called North Korea part of an “axis of evil,” was treating it like a serious negotiating partner. The United States had promised to release the money by mid-March and in return North Korea  promised to shut down the reactor by mid-April. But the process took  longer than expected because few banks wanted to touch the money. Finally, Dalkombank, of Russia,  agreed to act as an intermediary. It said Monday that the money had been transferred to the Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea. North Korea said it would use the released money “for improving the standard of people’s living and humanitarian purposes,” as the United States demanded. But neither North Korea nor the United States elaborated on how to check whether the promise would be kept.

The U.S. hopes to get North Korea to begin to dismantle its nuclear arms program by releasing $25 million in frozen assets.
==::==

==::==
WASHINGTON, June 11 — The United States appears to be close to reaching a deal to transfer $25 million in frozen funds toNorth Korea, with Russia and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York acting as intermediaries, in hopes of getting North Korea to begin to dismantle its nuclear arms program, American officials said Monday. The funds have been frozen for nearly two years at a bank that the Bush administration has labeled a violator of American money laundering laws. Because of that label, the bank is barred from doing business with any bank in the United States. The bank,  Banco Delta Asia, is based in Macao, a semiautonomous region in China. It has been accused by the United States of helping North Korea finance its nuclear arms program, and carrying out counterfeiting and narcotics activities. In February, North Korea agreed to begin dismantling its nuclear program in return for several political and economic concessions, including the return of its frozen funds. It also insisted that the money being routed through an international bank in a transaction be in dollars. Major banks that were asked to facilitate the deal balked, however, and the money remained frozen. North Korea then continued to refuse to shut down its main nuclear plant, which the United States says is processing fuel for nuclear bombs. Several banks in China and the United States, including Wachovia Bank, refused to carry out the transaction. They cited a ruling by the Treasury Department in March that barred American banks from facilitating dollar transactions with the Macao bank. Recently,  a Russian bank agreed to be the vehicle for the transaction, American officials said, provided that it could obtain dollars to carry it out. With American laws barring American commercial banks from supplying the dollars, officials turned to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to facilitate the deal with North Korea. “The United States is working with Russian and Macanese authorities to facilitate the transfer” of North Korean funds that were previously frozen at Banco Delta Asia, said Molly Millerwise, a Treasury Department spokeswoman. “We appreciate the willingness of the Russian government to facilitate this transaction and the good cooperation of the Macanese authorities.” The Wall Street Journal reported details of the proposed deal on Monday. American officials said because the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was not a private bank, but part of the Federal Reserve system, it was not subject to American laws barring commercial transactions involving illicit funds. The system is independent of the government but run by presidential appointees. Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs, has said that as soon as the money is transferred to North Korea, the United States would demand that North Korean fulfill the commitments it made in February. The Bush administration has come under criticism, especially from conservatives, for making the deal with North Korea. Many of the critics charge that American officials were too trusting of the North’s intentions. North Korea agreed to disable its nuclear facilities in a deal with the United States, China, Russia, Japan and South Korea. The failure to unfreeze the $25 million has been frustrating to the Bush administration for weeks. In April, a senior Treasury delegation failed to get the money transferred after 13 days of talks in Beijing.

The agreement clears the way for talks to focus on implementing a nuclear disarmament accord.

BEIJING, March 18 — The United States andNorth Koreahave resolved a standoff over North Korean funds frozen in a bank account in Macao, clearing the way for talks to focus on implementing a nuclear disarmament accord, Chinese and American officials said today. Christopher Hill, an assistant secretary of state who is the chief American envoy at the talks, said he met with representatives from the North Korea delegation over the weekend to explain the American position on $25 million in North Korea-related accounts  in Macao’s Banco Delta Asia. An 18-month investigation into the bank ended last week, putting responsibility for returning the funds to North Korea in the hands of the authorities in Macao. But funds connected to illegal activities, like money laundering, counterfeiting, and narcotics and weapons trafficking, are not supposed to be returned. North Korean officials have said several times in recent days that they will not move forward with their commitment to shut down Yongbyon by mid April unless they recover the $25 million.North Korean officials have sent mixed signals about whether the Treasury Department action satisfies their demands to end the dispute. Senior officials in Pyongyang have not yet indicated that they consider the Macao matter to be resolved. But the issue “will not be an impediment to our six-party talks,” Mr. Hill told reporters. The North Korean officials “made it very clear that they have begun their tasks for the purpose of denuclearization.” Chinese State Councilor Tang Jiaxuan told a group of visiting Japanese lawmakers today  that the United States  and North Korea had  resolved the dispute, Hidenao Nakagawa, secretary-general of Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party, told reporters. The United States, North Korea, China, Russia, South Korea and Russia reached an initial agreement on Feb. 13 that gave North Korea 60 days to shut down its facility for producing plutonium for nuclear weapons at Yongbyon in return for aid and security pledges. The six parties will convene on Monday in the Chinese capital to hammer out details of that agreement and establish working groups to discuss a variety of other diplomatic and security concerns. Daniel Glaser, a Treasury department official, completed talks on Saturday with banking authorities in Macao, who operate under Chinese sovereignty,   and traveled to Beijing today  to hold discussions about the financial issue. Meanwhile, Mr. Hill said he hopes to set up a working group to examine the delicate issue of whether North Korea has been seeking to make nuclear fuel from a second source, highly enriched uranium, as well as its better known effort to use plutonium for the same purpose. Bush administration officials initially raised allegations that the North had a clandestine uranium program underway in 2002, citing intelligence from Pakistan, which American officials said may have sold equipment for enriching uranium to North Korea. The allegations were one of the factors that led to a collapse of an earlier agreement to freeze North Korea’s plutonium program. North Korea in October exploded its first nuclear device, which was made using plutonium. Pyongyang has denied that it has sought to build bombs using highly enriched uranium, but North Korean officials have said recently that they are willing to discuss the matter with the United States.

Negotiators will consider a draft agreement that promises rare but limited steps toward curbing the North’s nuclear ambitions.

==::==
BEIJING, Friday, Feb. 9 (Reuters) — The prospect for progress  toward endingNorth Korea’s nuclear arms program brightened on Friday as negotiators considered a plan for the country  to suspend operations at its nuclear facilities within two months. The  Kyodo news agency in Japan  said the proposal, drafted by China after the first day of six-country talks in Beijing, would help the North meet its  needs for more energy  in return for concessions on its nuclear program. The reported  progress in the talks among  the two Koreas, China, the United States, Japan and Russia came after American   and North Korean negotiators held pathbreaking direct  talks in Berlin last month. Their meetings cooled tension that had grown  after North Korea  staged its first nuclear test blast in October and the United Nations responded with sanctions. Envoys to the new talks, which began Thursday, voiced hope that North Korea would accept measures to rein in its nuclear activities in return for aid and security assurances, as outlined in a deal that was hammered out in 2005 but never carried out. “We’ve gone 18 months without anything, and so we have to pick up the pace,”  the chief American  negotiator, Assistant Secretary of State Christopher R. Hill, told reporters just before the talks resumed on Friday. Citing unidentified United States  officials, NBC News reported that North Korea was offering to suspend and eventually disable its nuclear program and permit United Nations  inspections of facilities. In turn, the North  wants diplomatic relations with the United States, an end to United Nations  sanctions and hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel aid, NBC reported. In Beijing, Japan’s chief negotiator, Kenichiro Sasae, said the six sides still had much ground to cover. “It’s too early to discuss whether the draft agreement is acceptable, as each country is to present its ideas and I believe China has its own ideas,” Mr. Sasae told reporters. South Korea’s envoy, Chun Yung-woo, also  sounded a note of caution. The draft was a “fine one” as a basis for discussions, Mr. Chun told reporters, adding, “I don’t want to prejudge whether the discussions will be smooth.” North Korea’s envoy, Kim Kye-gwan, told the delegates on Thursday that his country  was “ready to make its first step” toward denuclearization, Russia’s Interfax reported, quoting an unidentified source close to the negotiations.

The United Nations Development Program agreed to cease $1.7 million in new projects in North Korea until completion of what Alejandro D. Wolff, the acting United States ambassador, called a “real, full, thorough, independent, investigative audit” and to end direct payments in hard currency to local staff members and vendors and recruitment through the North Korean government. The $2.7 million in programs that will go forward are those that directly benefit the people of North Korea, officials said. The action followed complaints from the United States and Japan that some money could be diverted to the government, a claim that North Korea dismissed as “ridiculous and nonsense.”.

Sony’s devastating hack, as well as cyberattacks on big companies like Home Depot and JPMorgan Chase, earn 2014’s tech moniker.

==::==
­SCENE: LOS ANGELES — DAY ­ Two Hollywood executives walk along Sunset Boulevard sipping coffee. The Hollywood sign hangs in the distance, overlooking all of Tinseltown. The executives are discussing the Sony hacking scandal. ­EXECUTIVE 1 “Those emails aren’t really that bad. I mean, come on, I’ve sent much worse to people at other studios. Remember that thread on Tom Cruise?” Both executives laugh as they drink their coffee. ­EXECUTIVE 2 “I totally agree. And let’s be realistic. If you went through anyone’s email in America, you’d find a deluge of nasty stuff about co-workers. Imagine what the inbox of a Wall Street analyst looks like.” ­EXECUTIVE 1 “Well, I’ll tell you one thing, I’m not sending emails like that anymore. The next time I want to rag on Angelina Jolie, I’m picking up the phone.” In recent weeks, a cloud has hung over Hollywood as thehacking of Sony PicturesEntertainment has exposed one embarrassing tidbit after the next. While hackers have released Sony employees’ personal information, including somesalaries, medical records, Social Security numbersand even unreleased movies, it has been the slew of private emails between executives that has generated the most titillating headlines. Which, while sad, is understandable. Mix celebrities, money and salacious gossip and you’ve got a potion very few people can stop themselves from taking a little sip from. (Some of theemails from Amy Pascal, co-chairwoman of Sony Pictures, for example, detail conversations where Angelina Jolie was called a “minimally talented spoiled brat,” andracially tingedemails about President Obama’s imagined movie tastes.) Movie executives I spoke with, all of whom declined to be named for fear that speaking out would entice hackers to target their inboxes, said the Sony emails were relatively tame by Hollywood standards. “I’ve seen much, much worse,” a well-known screenwriter said. “Heck, I’ve sent much, much worse.” One person reminded me of thevulgarity-spewing characterAri Gold from HBO’s “Entourage,” who is based on real Hollywood characters. And as my colleagues Michael Cieply and Brooks Barnes notedin an article Monday, “virtually nothing in Sony’s stolen emails looks different from what would likely surface if the hackers hit another studio.” But rather than change their trash-talking ways, the executives say the real lesson of the Sony hack is to assume that no email is safe from prying eyes. And so in recent days, when they had something vulgar or highly sensitive to share, they have found themselves going back to the old-fashioned phone call. Some are even walking down the hallway to deliver profanities in person. According to a producer in Hollywood, people have been staying clear of email and opting for cellphones over the past two weeks as studios have been bolstering firewalls and email systems. “Everyone has been doing business on their cellphone since this happened,” the person said, asking not to be named. “The reality is, every studio has emails in their system that would cause the chaos if they came out." Or as Jenni Konner, a writer and executive producer for HBO’s “Girls,” saidon TwitterTuesday night: “The worst thing about the Sony hacks is people using the phone again.” It’s not only people in Hollywood who are picking up the phone again in case of an email hack. For the rest of us, the Sony hacking is just another example of how our emails are highly insecure. “Don’t put anything in an email that you wouldn’t want to see on the front page of The New York Times the next day,” saidBrian Krebs, who specializes in cybercrime and operates the website Krebs on Security. “It’s like putting a postcard in the mail.” “And you can’t unsay anything you’ve said on the Internet,” Mr. Krebs added. Anyone who thinks they are immune hasn’t been following the news this year. If I had to give 2014 a tech moniker, it would be The Year of the Hack, with numerous companies includingHome Depot,JPMorgan Chaseand now Sony the victim of cyberattacks in which millions of customers’ information were stolen. So what are we supposed to do: never utter a negative word about anyone ever again? That’s about as unrealistic as high school students not standing by their locker gossiping (or doing so via text message). “The most devastating part of this entire story is even if Sony Pictures employees did everything right themselves, using the best passwords and the best encryption, they are still at the mercy of their I.T. managers,” said Kevin Roose, an editor at Fusion who has spentweeks going throughall the email in the Sony hack. “Every computer is a Pandora’s box of sensitive and incriminating data, and most of that data isn’t even ours.” Mr. Roose suggested we could learn from teenagers, who are flocking to privacy-minded services like Snapchat, where text and images can disappear after being read. “While it’s not perfect, it’s a lot better than email or text messages,” he said. Perhaps it seems appropriate to give the last word here to Ms. Pascal, who has been in the eye of the Sony hacking storm: ­SCENE: LOS ANGELES — DAY­ Amy Pascalbeing interviewedby a Deadline reporter about her leaked emails.­ ­DEADLINE “Is there something you hope people reading these emails will factor into their thought process?” ­MS. PASCAL “What you’d like to say is, don’t read them. Can we all make a pact not to read these, whether they’re mine or somebody else’s? Because I’m not the last person this is going to happen to.” Fade to black.

The organization, the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, reported on the website38 Norththat recent commercial satellite imagery of the North’s Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center showed evidence of a lengthy reactor shutdown. It suggested fuel rods might have been removed from the reactor in preparation for extracting plutonium from the spent rods. Also on Thursday, North Korea warned that the recent vote at the United Nations to refer the North’s leaders to the International Criminal Court for prosecution for crimes against humanity left the country no option but to consider another nuclear test..

SEOUL, South Korea —  Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, is “not feeling well,” a state-run television station reported this week, in a rare revelation about his health. In a documentary broadcast on Thursday, the North’s Central TV showed Mr. Kim, who has not been seen in public in recent weeks, walking with a limp while visiting a factory in Nampo, a provincial town southwest of Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, last month. A narrator intoned about the tireless work of Mr. Kim, “our marshal, who lights the path of leadership for the people like a flame, although he was not feeling well.” Central TV, a key channel of government propaganda, mentioned Mr. Kim’s physical trouble in the context of what it called his selfless dedication to his people. Still, it was so rare for the news media in North Korea to discuss the condition of the supreme leader that Thursday’s report was widely picked up by the South Korean media on Friday. North Korea’s tightly controlled media never mentioned the health conditions of Mr. Kim’s grandfather and father, who ruled before him and suffered various ailments, like diabetes. Video footage and photos never revealed a large cyst that Mr. Kim’s paternal grandfather, Kim Il-sung, developed on the back of his head in his later years. Mr. Kim, who is widely believed to be about 30 although his government has never revealed his age, assumed the top leadership position after his father, Kim Jong-il,died of heart failure in 2011. Mr. Kim has since demonstrated a youthful leadership style by visiting farms, factories and military units more often than his father did. He appears to be bolder than his forebears in acknowledging problems. In a departure from the habitually sanitized description of state affairs, his country’s news media once quoted him as criticizing the poor upkeep of a public park and showed him pulling up weeds there. But his health became a topic of speculation among outside analysts in July, after he was seen limping with his right leg in North Korean television footage. He was again shown walking with a limp this month, this time with his left leg. The images prompted South Korean analysts to speculate that he was suffering from gout or arthritis, in addition to his obesity. Mr. Kim was already chubby when he took over after his father’s death. But according to video footage and photographs in the North Korean media, he appears to have gained weight since then. The documentary was shown before a prerecorded broadcast of a session of the legislative Supreme People’s Assembly, which had met earlier on Thursday. Mr. Kim did not attend the meeting, where some of his top aides were appointed to seats on his powerful National Defense Commission. It was the first time that Mr. Kim, a member of the assembly, had missed a parliamentary meeting since taking power. The broadcast of the documentary — with its propagandistic spin on Mr. Kim’s health — may have been timed to counter growing speculation at home and abroad about his health, according to the South Korean news media. North Korean TV and newspapers have not reported his public activities since Sept. 3, when Mr. Kim was said to have watched a musical performance. It is not unusual for senior North Korean leaders to disappear from public view for weeks at a stretch. Still, the inner workings of the top leadership in Pyongyang have been cloaked in such secrecy that the outside world was in the dark about the death of Mr. Kim’s father in 2011 until the North Korean media announced it two days later. A prolonged absence of a top North Korean official often catches the attention of outside analysts, who look for signs of a political purge and other trouble within the isolated leadership. Park Soo-jin, a spokeswoman for South Korea’s Ministry of National Unification, said on Friday that the government could not comment on Mr. Kim’s health but was closely following it.

SEOUL, South Korea —  North Korea said Friday that Jang Song-thaek, the uncle and presumed mentor of its leader, Kim Jong-un, was executed for plotting a military coup. The announcement was a highly unusual admission of instability from the reclusive, nuclear-armed country, which normally cloaks any signs of disloyalty to the Kim dynasty that has ruled since the country’s founding. It was the first time in recent decades that the North revealed what it purported was an attempt to overthrow its leadership, analysts said, and the first publicly announced execution of a member of the ruling family. Calling him a “traitor” and “worse than a dog,” the state-run Korean Central News Agency said Mr. Jang, 67, was executed on Thursday, immediately after he was convicted of treason in a special military court. “He lost his mind due to his greed for power,” the agency reported. “He persistently plotted to spread his evil design into the military, believing that he could overthrow the leadership if he could mobilize the military.” North Korea also released a photo of Mr. Jang standing at the military court, with his hands bound. Two State Security agents in military uniforms held his arms while one of them pressed the back of Mr. Jang’s neck so he would bow it before the tribunal. The news agency report did not say how Mr. Jang was executed. The North usually executes criminals by a firing squad. Even before the reported execution, Mr. Jang’s recent downfall had raised worries in the United States and South Korea that Mr. Kim might lash out, possibly staging another nuclear test or instigating a military provocation against the South. China, the North’s longtime patron, was also unnerved by mounting evidence of an internal power struggle that could destabilize its already troublesome ally and possibly increase an American military presence in the region. Mr. Jang, believed to have been the second-most-powerful man in the country, was the most prominent North Korean purged and executed under Mr. Kim, who South Korean officials said was resorting to “a reign of terror” in an attempt to consolidate his power. Mr. Jang was the husband of Kim Kyong-hee, a sister of Kim Jong-il, Mr. Kim’s father and the North’s longtime leader. The fate of Ms. Kim was not known, though analysts say it would be unlikely for Kim Jong-un to harm a blood relative. Mr. Jang had been a fixture in the North Korean elite for the past 40 years, serving in major party posts under Kim Jong-il. During a party meeting on Sunday, North Korea stripped Mr. Jang of all his powerful posts and expelled him from the ruling Workers’ Party. On Monday, the state-run TV showed the spectacle of the once-powerful man being hauled off from the party meeting by uniformed guards. At the time some analysts said the treatment was a sign that Mr. Jang would be killed, while others still doubted that Mr. Kim would go that far. The State Department said Thursday that it could not verify the execution, but a deputy spokeswoman, Marie Harf, said, “We have no reason to doubt the official K.C.N.A. report.” “If confirmed,” she said, “this is another example of the extreme brutality of the North Korean regime.” Given the opaque nature of the North Korean state, it is possible that the charges against Mr. Jang were trumped up to remove a powerful man Mr. Kim may have worried was a threat. The K.C.N.A. report suggested that Mr. Jang started nurturing his own political ambitions even as Mr. Kim’s father began grooming his son to succeed him. If true, his moves would most likely have been seen as a betrayal; at the time many analysts believed Mr. Jang and his wife had been handpicked by Kim Jong-il to help his young and inexperienced son navigate the North’s treacherous politics and carry on the family dynasty. The younger Mr. Kim took over the leadership of the country after his father’s death in late 2011, making him the third generation to run the state. Chang Yong-seok, a senior researcher at the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies at Seoul National University, said that Mr. Kim had been enforcing a generational change in the party, government and military leadership by elevating people loyal to him and that the removal of Mr. Jang and his group could further consolidate his power. “But if it has been another group — most likely, conservatives within the North Korean regime — that has engineered Jang’s removal, then they could now control what Kim Jong-un sees, hears and says,” Mr. Chang said. Now that Mr. Jang, something of a moderate, is gone, Mr. Kim could find it hard to control the hard-liners, he said.

An investigation of conditions in the nation’s gulags has been aided by information from people have escaped the police state over the years.

==::==
GENEVA —  The United Nations experts investigating human rights conditions in North Korea said Tuesday that the “shocking” evidence they had collected from defectors and others suggested “large-scale” patterns of abuse that demanded an international response. The Human Rights Council pushed for the investigation in an attempt to bring new attention to allegations of horrifying abuses at the North’s infamous gulags that have been trickling out for years as more people have escaped the brutal police state. Until now, world powers including the United States had focused instead on attempts to dismantle the North’s nuclear weapons program. The chairman of the three-member Commission of Inquiry, Michael Donald Kirby, told reporters that the testimony he had heard in recent months evoked reactions similar to the discovery of concentration camps in Europe after World War II. He cited the statements of a former prisoner who said she had seen another woman forced to drown her baby in a bucket, and the account of a man who said he had collected and burned the bodies of prisoners who had died of starvation. Experts say the number of prisoners in gulags has dropped in recent years — to an estimated 120,000 or fewer from a possible high of 200,000 — but that might be partly because so many had died from forced labor and a lack of food. “The great value” of the report, said Eileen Chamberlain Donahoe, United States ambassador to the Human Rights Council, is that it “has begun to shed light on the horrifying realities of life in North Korea and raise international awareness of the ongoing tragedy and barbaric conditions there.” She also said the findings represented a “small but significant crack” in the North’s “information blockade.” The findings of the three-member Commission of Inquiry were part of an interim report to the council; the final report in March is expected to eventually be presented to the United Nations General Assembly. It remains unclear what actions the United Nations might take. Any referral to the International Criminal Court for human rights abuses would need to be approved by the Security Council, which includes North Korea’s longtime ally, China. Although China did not actively oppose the investigation, a senior Chinese diplomat in Geneva on Tuesday criticized the interim findings. “Politicized accusations and pressures are not helpful to improving human rights in any country,” Chen Chuandong said, according to Reuters. “On the contrary, they will only provoke confrontation and undermine the foundation and atmosphere for international human rights cooperation.” Mr. Kirby said the panel had submitted several requests seeking cooperation and access to North Korea, including a letter to the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, but the North Korean government said it “totally and categorically rejects the Commission of Inquiry.” A senior North Korean diplomat in Geneva, Kim Yong-ho, said Tuesday that the evidence cited by the panel had been “fabricated and invented” by forces hostile to North Korea, and dismissed the commission as “a hotbed of confrontation and distrust.” Mr. Kirby said that he had invited North Korea to provide hard evidence that refuted any of the testimony received, but that none was forthcoming.

The appointment is seen as part of Kim Jong-un’s effort to tighten his grip on power.

SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea has removed a hard-line general from the post of armed forces minister, filling the job with a little-known three-star general, according to official North Korean news reports on Monday. Since Kim Jong-un took over the leadership in Pyongyang in late 2011, there has been a continued reordering of top jobs in the ruling Workers’ Party and the military. Mr. Kim is using the personnel changes to tighten his grip on power, analysts said. The new minister, Jang Jong-nam, is in his 50s, which is considered young among senior personnel in North Korea, officials in Seoul said. They said that Mr. Jang, the third official to take the role of armed services minister since Mr. Kim came to power, appeared to be part of a new generation the North Korean leader was promoting to put his stamp on the military. At a military rally in Pyongyang in December, Mr. Jang, then commander of the First Corps, which guarded the eastern border with South Korea, pledged allegiance to Mr. Kim and vowed to turn South Korea into “death valleys” if given the order to attack. Little else is known about Mr. Jang. Mention of his new role was buried in state news media dispatches listing those who attended an art performance with Mr. Kim. It was unclear what happened to the departing armed forces minister, Gen.Kim Kyok-sik. South Korean officials believed that he commanded units responsible forsinking one of South Korea’s warshipsandshelling a South Korean border island, attacks that killed 50 South Koreans. General Kim, 74, was one of the oldest military leaders in North Korea after Mr. Kim filled top military jobs with younger generals. He was referred to as the armed forces minister in the North Korean news media as recently as May 4. In North Korea, the armed forces minister is not the top defense job. In the shifting party hierarchy, other military jobs, like the head of the general staff of the Korean People’s Army and the head of the military’s General Political Department, often come before the armed services minister. Like his late father, Kim Jong-il, Mr. Kim has been trying to portray himself as a strong military leader. After its third nuclear test in February, North Korea drastically escalated its hostile political speech against the United States and South Korea. On Monday, the United States and South Korea started a two-day joint naval exercise involving a nuclear-powered American aircraft carrier. North Korea has criticized the carrier’s arrival in South Korea, calling the drill a preparation for an invasion of the North.

The United Nations Human Rights Council will meet Monday to consider calls for an international inquiry into possible crimes against humanity.
==::==
2013-03-11T00:00:00Z
==::==
GENEVA — Already angry over tougher sanctionsimposed last weekto punish its nuclear tests,North Koreafaces renewed pressure over its human rights record as theUnited Nations Human Rights Councilmeets Monday to consider calls for an international inquiry into possible crimes against humanity. Marzuki Darusman, an investigator for theUnited Nations, is expected to present a report to the council urging the creation of an international commission of inquiry to follow up on the abuses recorded in the eight years that a United Nations official has monitored human rights in the North. “An inquiry mechanism could produce a more complete picture, quantify and qualify the violations in terms of international law, attribute responsibility to particular actors or perpetrators of these violations and suggest effective courses of international action,” Mr. Darusman said in the report. His recommendation will be taken up in a resolution sponsored by Japan and the European Union that the 47-member council was expected to adopt when it votes later in March. The proposal, backed by the United Nations human rights chief, Navi Pillay, as well as various human rights organizations, is expected to draw on concerns about North Korea’s conduct that prompted both the council and the General Assembly to pass resolutions last year condemning Pyongyang. “We are in effect ramping up international political pressure on this unparalleled, systemwide failure in respect to human rights,” Eileen Chamberlain Donahoe, the American ambassador to the Human Rights Council, said by telephone. “We’re hoping that even if it doesn’t crack the whole system that on some of these issues we might see some opening and some change because of this pressure.” Japan has been a strong supporter of a human rights investigation into North Korea. Japan has accused North Korea of kidnapping some of its citizens, and the issue remains a popular human rights and political cause. The creation of a commission of inquiry would be a victory for defectors from North Korea, including a handful of people who are said to be survivors of the isolated country’s infamous prison camps. Some of them have become among the most vocal campaigners for human rights in North Korea, holding rallies, testifying about starvation and torture in gulags and arguing that foreign governments must break their silence about the people living under one of the most repressive systems in the world. That argument has not always been popular in South Korea, where many of the defectors live. Many South Koreans believe that without an effective means of pressuring North Korea, which has defied and survived decades of international sanctions, an open challenge of its human rights record would only make it more paranoid and repressive. South Korea used to abstain from any United Nations vote on human rights resolutions on North Korea. But after a conservative party took power five years ago, Seoul began voting for and even leading such moves. It also supports the creation of the commission of inquiry. Coupled with the new set of United Nations sanctions, the human rights report was expected to increase the pressure on the young North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. Reports of a guarded relaxation of state control of the economy in North Korea have alternated with signs of a renewed crackdown on outside influences. Concern over its nuclear program has sharpened international attention on North Korea, but human rights activists say that the North had rebuffed criticism of its abuses and that a commission of inquiry would provide a long-overdue spotlight on them. “Increased scrutiny by international inquiry affords a measure of protection, especially when coupled with the prospect of future criminal investigations and the deterrent effect such a prospect may have on individual perpetrators,” according to Mr. Darusman’s report. Mr. Darusman, taking stock of the United Nations investigations to date, identifies nine patterns of human rights violations, including denial of access to food, arbitrary detention in prison camps that are estimated to hold up to 200,000 people, and abductions of foreigners. Many, if not all, of these patterns “may amount to crimes against humanity, committed as part of systematic and/or widespread attacks against civilian populations,” the report says. Testimony from prisoners who have escaped the North Korean gulags appears to have played a part in the decision to take action. Ms. Pillay, in calling for an international inquiry in January, cited the “extremely harrowing” nature of the accounts she had received in a meeting with two of the escaped prisoners, describing a system that she called “the very antithesis of international human rights norms.” After eight years of inquiries, investigators had reached the point where they were forced to call for greater resources to continue their research, Mr. Darusman said in a telephone interview. Like other investigators, he has worked with a single assistant, limiting a sustained investigation. A commission of inquiry is likely to have three members, including Mr. Darusman, supported by researchers and a full-time secretariat. Even if an inquiry is commissioned, it remains unclear how effective it will be except as political symbol. North Korea does not allow outside investigators. And other countries have few means to force Pyongyang to provide access. No outsider has ever had a glimpse of a North Korean prison camp. North Korea rejected a critical General Assembly resolution in December as a “political plot” that escalated confrontation. The abuses that North Korea is accused of committing “cannot be allowed to exist in our country, where human rights and the fundamental freedom of the people are formally guaranteed by the legal system,” said Kim Song, the North Korean ambassador to the United Nations.

Pyongyang’s horrific human rights record must be placed on the world’s agenda.
==::==

==::==
North Korea is in the news again for the same old reason — nuclear tests. The United Nations Security Council was right to pass a resolution; the world is right to be deeply concerned. There is also another reason to take action on North Korea: It has possibly the worst human rights record in the world. In the world’s most oppressed nation, there is no freedom of speech or religion; in the world’s most closed nation, no freedom of information; in the world’s darkest nation, little light, politically, spiritually and even physically. If you look at a satellite map of the Korean Peninsula, the South is lit up brightly; the North, where electricity is almost as scarce as hope, the map is almost completely black. North Korea is ruled by the only dictatorship that is both a dynasty and, in its own mind, a deity.  An estimated 200,000 people are in dire condition in North Korea’s prison camps, or kwan-li-so. Extreme torture, sexual violence, slave labor, starvation and execution are commonplace. Abuses are so widespread and severe that the former U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in North Korea, Vitit Muntarbhorn, described the country as “sui generis — in a category of its own.” He called on the United Nations to take up the case “at the pinnacle of the system” and urged the international community to “mobilize the totality of the U.N. to ... support processes which concretize responsibility and an end to impunity.” Until very recently, his calls fell on deaf ears. Momentum is now gathering pace, however, for the establishment of a commission of inquiry to investigate crimes against humanity in North Korea. For the first time, factors favorable to achieving this have come together, providing a window of opportunity. But that window is narrow. The current composition of the U.N. Human Rights Council means that such a proposal, at the approaching session in March, stands a good chance of being passed. So it is now a matter of leadership and initiative. A government, or a group of governments, most likely from Europe but with strong backing from Japan, South Korea and the United States, needs to respond to the challenge and put forward a recommendation. Governments that choose to act can be confident that they have some very credible support. The current rapporteur, Marzuki Darusman, has called explicitly for an investigation into “egregious” violations. Earlier this month, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, Navi Pillay, said that one year after Kim Jong-un took over there is “almost no sign of improvement,” and argued that “an in-depth inquiry into one of the worst — but least understood and reported — human rights situations in the world is not only fully justified, but long overdue.” The international legal expert William Schabas and the former chief prosecutor of Slobodan Milosevic, Geoffrey Nice, support an investigation. In his Senate confirmation hearing, John Kerry, the nominee to be the next secretary of state, said the Obama administration should be more vocal on behalf of North Korean political prisoners. Late last year, 179 North Korean escapees wrote to foreign ministers of many countries, urging them to establish a commission of inquiry. Over 40 human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have backed the idea. Legislators around the world have spoken out in favor. Most recently, Japan and Australia have joined calls for an inquiry. It is no longer a fringe issue. Yet what would such an inquiry achieve? It is likely that North Korea would not cooperate, and very unlikely that if an inquiry recommended a referral to the International Criminal Court, the Security Council would take that step. Even if it did, the fact that Sudan’s Omar al-Bashir still roams free despite a warrant for his arrest hardly instills confidence that action could be taken to hold Kim Jong-un to account. Nevertheless, these are not arguments for inertia. Even if, as is likely, Pyongyang won’t play ball, there are thousands of escapees from North Korea who would give evidence. Investigators, who would be respected world experts acting with the full authority, credibility and resources of the U.N., could assemble and assess evidence. Simply attaching the tag “crimes against humanity” — if that was the conclusion — might put pressure on Pyongyang to temper its behavior. A commission of inquiry would make recommendations for what the U.N. and the international community should do. Some may argue that an investigation would threaten any lingering hope of dialogue. I disagree. I have long advocated critical engagement, rather than isolation, because our objective should be to prise open the world’s most closed nation, not turn the key in the lock. In 2010 I traveled with two British legislators to Pyongyang to talk to the regime about human rights. But central to that dialogue must be concern for human rights. Just as Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan put concern for Soviet dissidents firmly on the table, the world today needs to look North Korea in the eye and challenge Pyongyang over its gulags. Critical engagement, investigation, information, and accountability go hand in hand. A commission of inquiry would put North Korea’s horrific human rights record where it belongs — at the center of the international agenda. It is time to shine a light on one of the darkest corners of the earth.

The chief human rights official, Navi Pillay, pointed to North Korea’s political prison camps, which she said punish people for peaceful activities and use other forms of cruel treatment.

GENEVA — The chief human rights official at theUnited Nations, Navi Pillay, called on Monday for an international inquiry into human rights offenses committed by the North Korean government over many decades. Ms. Pillay, the Geneva-based high commissioner for human rights, pointed toNorth Korea’s “elaborate network of political prison camps,” believed by human rights organizations to hold 200,000 prisoners. The camps not only punish people for peaceful activities, but also employ “torture and other forms of cruel and inhumane treatment, summary executions, rape, slave labor and forms of collective punishment that may amount to crimes against humanity,” she said. When Kim Jong-unsucceeded his fatheras the leader of North Korea in December 2011, there was some hope that the change would lead to a relaxation of harsh policies, Ms. Pillay said, but “we see almost no sign of improvement.” Instead, she said, North Korea’s self-imposed isolation had “allowed the government to mistreat its citizens to a degree that should be unthinkable in the 21st century.” Human rights groups have been lobbying for an international investigation over the past year, and they hope to persuade Japan to sponsor a resolution at the next session of theHuman Rights Councilin March that would create a commission of inquiry. Both the council and the United Nations General Assembly passed resolutions condemning North Korea in 2012 by consensus, unopposed even by China, the North’s closest ally. Ms. Pillay expressed concern that international preoccupation with North Korea’s missile andnuclear weaponsprograms had diverted attention from human rights abuses that have “no parallel anywhere in the world.” “What we are trying to do is put human rights as a priority in the international debate on North Korea,” said Juliette de Rivero, Geneva director of Human Rights Watch, one of more than 40 organizations in theInternational Coalition to Stop Crimes Against Humanity in North Koreathat are backing the inquiry. “Right now it’s nearly invisible.”

Former Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico and Google’s executive chairman, Eric E. Schmidt, were advised against a visit to the country, though an expert says it might aid in the discussion of a detained American citizen.

WASHINGTON — The State Department said Thursday that it had advised against a visit toNorth Koreaby the former governor of New Mexico,Bill Richardson, and Google’s executive chairman,Eric E. Schmidt. Neither Mr. Richardson nor Mr. Schmidt have publicly discussed reports of the possibility of such a trip or its purpose. The two men could not be reached for comment on Thursday. Victor D. Cha, an expert on North Korea at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that the visit might aid discussion of a humanitarian issue of concern to the United States: North Korea’s detention last month of a naturalized American citizen born in South Korea. North Korea identified the man as Bae Jun-ho, and human rights activists as Kenneth Bae, 44. A report by the North’s state-run Korean Central News Agency said, without elaborating, that Mr. Bae had admitted to committing “hostile acts against the republic,” a crime punishable by a year in prison. The human rights activists said Mr. Bae had run a travel company that specialized in taking tourists and prospective investors to North Korea. His arrest came shortly after North Korea launched a long-range rocket that it insisted was part of a peaceful space program. But the United States asserts that the real purpose is to develop a ballistic missile as part of a military program. “Frankly, we don’t think the timing of this is particularly helpful,” the State Department spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, said Thursday about talk of a trip by Mr. Richardson and Mr. Schmidt. “They are well aware of our views.” Mr. Richardson has occasionally served as an unofficial mediator on seemingly intractable issues between North Korea and the United States. Mr. Schmidt has been a prominent campaign donor to President Obama. But the State Department underscored that the two men were not representing the administration. “They are private citizens,” Ms. Nuland said. “They are traveling in an unofficial capacity. They are not going to be accompanied by any U.S. officials. They are not carrying any messages from us.” Mr. Cha, who served on the staff of the National Security Council during the Bush administration, also speculated that a visit by the men might encourage Kim Jong-un, the young North Korean leader, to relax the state’s rigid controls on information. “The restricted control of information lies at the heart of the D.P.R.K. state, and yet it is about to host one of the West’s greatest facilitators of borderless information flows,” Mr. Cha added, using the acronym for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. “If Google is the first small step in piercing the information bubble in Pyongyang, it could be a very interesting development.”

Washington and its allies have said they think North Korea’s rocket program has less to do with putting a satellite into orbit than with developing a vehicle for a nuclear warhead.
==::==
2012-12-12T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL, South Korea —North Korealaunched a long-range rocket on Wednesday morning that appeared to reach as far as the Philippines, an apparent success for the country’s young and untested new leader,Kim Jong-un, and a step toward the nation’s goal of mastering the technology needed to build an intercontinental ballistic missile. The North American Aerospace Defense Command, or Norad, said it had detected the launching and tracked the missile — a Galaxy-3 rocket, called the Unha-3 by the North — as its first stage appeared to fall into the Yellow Sea and the second stage into the Philippine Sea. “Initial indications are that the missile deployed an object that appeared to achieve orbit,” Norad said. “At no time was the missile or the resultant debris a threat to North America.” But the timing of the launching appeared to take American officials by surprise. Just an hour or two before blastoff from the Sohae Satellite Launching Station in Tongchang-ri on North Korea’s western coast, near China, American officials at a holiday reception at the Japanese ambassador’s residence in Washington said they thought the North Koreans had run into technical problems that could take them weeks to resolve. North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said the rocket succeeded in the ostensible goal of putting an earth-observation satellite named Kwangmyongsong-3, or Shining Star-3, into orbit, and celebrations by members of the North Korean media were reported. Although the launching was driven in part by domestic considerations, analysts said it carried far-reaching foreign relations implications, coming as leaders in Washington and Beijing — as well as those soon to be chosen in Tokyo and Seoul — try to form a new way of coping with North Korea after two decades of largely fruitless attempts to end its nuclear and missile ambitions. For President Obama, the launching deepened the complexity of dealing with the new North Korean government, after four years in which promises of engagement, then threats of deeper sanctions, have done nothing to modify the country’s behavior. A statement from the White House by Tommy Vietor, the National Security Council spokesman, called the launch a “a highly provocative act that threatens regional security, directly violates United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874, contravenes North Korea’s international obligations, and undermines the global nonproliferation regime.” The launching also appeared to dash the hopes of some analysts that Mr. Kim might soften North Korea’s confrontational stance. It showed him instead as intent on bolstering his father’s main legacy ofnuclear weaponsand long-range missile programs to justify his own hereditary rule. For Mr. Kim, barely a year in office, the launching was important in three respects. Its apparent success, after a test of the same rocket failed spectacularly seconds after takeoff in April, demonstrated what one American intelligence official called “a more professional operation” to diagnose and solve rocket-design problems similar to those the United States encountered in the 1960s. He built credibility with the powerful North Korean military, whose ranks he purged in recent months, replacing some top leaders with his own loyalists. He also advertised that the country, despite its backwardness and isolation, could master a missile technology that it has previously marketed to Iran, Pakistan and others. Some American officials, who have privately warned of increased missile cooperation between Iran and North Korea over the past year, have argued that the North Korean test would benefit Iran as much as North Korea. The North has a long way to go before it can threaten neighboring countries, and perhaps one day the West Coast of the United States, with a nuclear-armed missile. It has yet to develop a nuclear warhead small enough to fit atop its missile, experts say, and it has not tested a re-entry vehicle that can withstand the heat of the atmosphere. Nor is it clear that the country knows how to aim a missile with much accuracy. “What’s important here is the symbolism, especially if the test seems reasonably successful,” said Victor D. Cha, a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “It’s not as if the U.S. can describe them anymore as a bunch of crazies who could never get anywhere with their technology. And it ends the argument that Kim Jong-un might be a young, progressive reformer who is determined to take the country in a new direction.” The missile capabilities of a country as opaque as North Korea are notoriously hard to assess. United States and South Korean officials have said that all of the North’s four multiple-stage rockets previously launched have exploded in midair or failed in their stated goal of thrusting a satellite into orbit. Nonetheless, during a visit to China early in 2011, Robert M. Gates, then Mr. Obama’s defense secretary, said that North Korea was within five years of being able to strike the continental United States with an intercontinental ballistic missile. The range of Wednesday’s test would fall far short of that goal, but suggests that the North has learned much about how to launch multistage rockets. North Korea insisted it was exercising its right to peaceful activity in space. But this is the third time the North has provoked the Obama administration — and, to some degree, its patron the Chinese — in four years. The country’s nuclear test in 2009 was intended to show that it had the capability to set off a nuclear explosion, though there is no evidence yet that its arsenal of a half-dozen to a dozen nuclear weapons could be deliverable outside North Korea. Then, in 2010, it showed a visiting Stanford scientist a uranium-enrichment plant that American intelligence services had missed. The message was that the North now had a second pathway to building a bomb; all its weapons so far have been made from reprocessed plutonium from nuclear plants. At the time that the North revealed the plant, the Obama administration said it would consult with allies about an appropriate response, but the North suffered few consequences. It may be betting that the rocket launching draws a similar response. Imposing sanctions on the North would be difficult. It has long been one of the most sanctioned countries on earth. While a further crackdown onoffshore bankingis possible, the North Koreans have no oil of their own to shut off. China could send a message by halting some deliveries to the North. Wednesday’s unusual wintertime rocket launching came five days before the one-year anniversary of the death of Mr. Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, on Dec. 17, which his son is trying to mark with a fanfare aimed at showcasing his dynasty’s achievement in empowering the small and impoverished nation. Some experts believe another nuclear test blast cannot be far off. The defiance Mr. Kim showed with his latest launch alarmed the region, which is going through sensitive changes of leadership. It came four days before the Dec. 16 lower-house election in Japan, where right-wing leaders have been gaining political leverage, thanks partly to North Korean threats. The provocation also presented an early test for candidates for the Dec. 19 presidential election in South Korea, all of whom have called for dialogue with the North. “Regardless what the international community says about it, this successful launching boosts Kim Jong-un’s posture by turning him into a fox in a hen house in Northeast Asia,” said Lee Byong-chul, senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation. “It paints South Korea, Japan and the United States into a corner because it shows that the North’s technology is advancing.” The launching is also expected to move Japan further toward the right as tensions over the country’s territorial disputes with neighboring countries remain high, Mr. Lee said. Mr. Kim needed to redeem his April humiliation not only among his country’s enemies, who he feared would not take him as a worthy foe, but also among his people, who have grown disenchanted with his government’s inability to resolve the prolonged economic crisis, South Korean officials and analysts said. Since he took power, Mr. Kim has tried to cement his authority with what analysts described as halfhearted economic reforms among some farms and factories, highlighting the perceived threats from the country’s external enemies, and, most recently, raising the specter of a reign of terror through talk of “squashing rebellious elements” at home. A series of top generals have recently been fired or demoted. In a statement in October, North Korea’s National Defense Commission said that when “midranking policy makers from the United States, National Security Council and C.I.A. recently met with us in official and unofficial settings,” they tried to assure the North that Washington had no “hostile” intent. “But the reality clearly showed that the messages we received from the United States were lies,” it said, citing the United States’ agreement to let South Korea nearly triple the reach of its ballistic missiles, putting all of the North within its range. The Washington-Seoul missile deal was to help South Korea better deter North Korea’s expanding missile capabilities. But North Korea called the deal a hostile move and said it now felt freer to test “long-range missiles for military purposes.”

Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s leader, has replaced his defense minister with a hard-line general as part of his attempt to fill the army leadership with a new generation of officers loyal to him, officials said Thursday.

SEOUL, South Korea —Kim Jong-un,North Korea’s leader, has replaced his defense minister with a hard-line general as part of his effort to fill the army leadership with a new generation of officers loyal to him, South Korean officials said Thursday. Kim Kyok-sik, a general who commanded North Korean units accused by the South ofsinking one of its warshipsandshelling a South Korean border islandin 2010, replaced Kim Jong-gak as minister of the People’s Armed Forces, said two government officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing government policy on intelligence matters. Fifty South Koreans were killed in the two 2010 episodes, although the North denies sinking the warship. “We have enough intelligence to believe that the minister was replaced, though our policy is not to officially confirm such a matter until North Korea confirms itself,” one of the South Korean officials said. The Associated Press reported from the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, that diplomats, whom it did not identify, said they had been informed of the replacement of the defense minister. For months, South Korean officials have suspected that a prolonged reshuffling of the North Korean party and military hierarchy has been under way, apparently beginning with the dismissal of Vice Marshal Ri Yong-ho as army chief in July. Both Vice Marshal Ri and Kim Jong-gak were loyal lieutenants of Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-un’s father,who died last December, and were believed to have been key promoters of the son as successor. They were among the four army generals who escorted the elder Kim’s coffin during his state funeral. Kim Jong-un, who took power after his father’s death, was testing the loyalty of top generals by dismissing or demoting them and letting them try to win his favor again, according to South Korean officials and analysts. Meanwhile, they say, he has been putting his own stamp on the military leadership by elevating a new lineup of officers who will owe their promotions to him, like Vice Marshal Choe Ryong-hae, director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People’s Army, and Hyon Yong-chol, who replaced Vice Marshal Ri as chief of the military’s general staff. North Korean generals have long been seen as chess pieces in the Kim family’s maneuvers to control the military, which is the backbone of the government’s control of the impoverished populace and whose missile and nuclear arms programs are its main leverage in negotiating with its external enemies. Generals have often been fired or demoted and later reinstated. All four of the top generals who escorted Kim Jong-il’s bier have now fallen from the top leadership under the son’s rule. The ousted defense minister, Kim Jong-gak, was appointed to the Politburo in April and installed in the defense post, replacing another of the four, Kim Yong-chun, who was reportedly transferred to a relatively low-profile party position. Kim Jong-gak disappeared from North Korean news reports after attending a state function late last month. Another of the four, U Dong-chuk, top leader of the North’s secret police and spy agency, has gone unmentioned in North Korean news reports since mid-March, prompting speculation that he may have been purged. His post was filled by Kim Won-hong in April. “Those who are not loyal to the party and the leader are not needed, no matter how skilled they are as military strategists,” Kim Jong-un was quoted by North Korean news media as saying during a speech last month. The new defense minister, Kim Kyok-sik, disappeared from public view soon after the shelling of the South Korean island in 2010. South Korean news media have reported that he was demoted. He resurfaced this month, wearing a general’s insignia while accompanying Kim Jong-un on a visit to a military unit.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreaintends to press ahead with its plan to launch a satellite into orbit next month, according to a government statement issued Tuesday, rebuffing President Obama and other world leaders who have told the country to cancel the launching or face the loss offood aidand additional sanctions. The North’s announcement came shortly after Mr. Obama and other leaders at a nuclear security summit meeting in Seoul condemned the planned launching — given the possibility that it is a cover for developing missile technology — as a provocation and violation of a United Nations Security Council resolution, as well as a waste of millions of dollars that could be used to buy food. On Tuesday, North Korea accused the United States of being confrontational and applying “double standards” on satellite capabilities. “We will never give up the launch of a satellite for peaceful purposes,” a spokesman for the North Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement carried by the state news agency, K.C.N.A. The spokesman advised the Obama administration to “drop the confrontation conception” and “make a bold decision to acknowledge that we also have a right to launch satellites.” Whether Mr. Obama was sincere when he said Monday that the United States had no hostile intent against the North will depend on “whether it applies double standards regarding our satellite launch,” the spokesman said. Washington and its allies believe that by launching rockets — regardless of their payload — North Korea has been developing intercontinental ballistic missile technology and the know-how to equip them with nuclear warheads. After the North’s last satellite launching, in 2009, the Security Council adopted a resolution demanding that the North refrain from “any launch using ballistic missile technology.” (North Korea portrayed that effort as a success, but Western military and private experts said a review of detailed tracking data showed the missile fell into the sea.) Washington was particularly surprised and offended because the North’s satellite plan wasannouncedbarely two weeks after North Korea agreed on Feb. 29 that it would place a moratorium on long-range missile tests in return for 240,000 tons of American food aid. With its rocket plans, North Korea also unleashed an international uproar that threatened to upstage the nuclear security summit meeting over which South Korea was presiding, with nearly 60 world leaders gathered in Seoul to discuss the prevention of nuclear terrorism. Japan and South Korea warned that they might fire at the North Korean rocket if it violated their airspace. Washington says that during the negotiations for the February deal, its officials clearly warned the North against a satellite launching, calling it a deal-breaker. The North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman said Tuesday that during those talks, its officials “consistently maintained that a moratorium on long-range missile launches does not include satellite launches for peaceful purposes.” How the two sides could have reached a deal despite such a disagreement remains unclear. Some analysts said the North Korean diplomats who negotiated the February deal might have been upended by hard-liners in Pyongyang who insisted on launching a satellite to celebrate the 100th birthday of the North’s founder, Kim Il-sung, on April 15. “The problem may well be the recklessness of hard-liners who apparently are calling the shots in policy making in North Korea now,” said Chang Yong-seok, a senior researcher at the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies at Seoul National University. “It seriously damages the standing of negotiators on both sides.” North Korea said Tuesday that the satellite launching was a “dying wish of Gen. Kim Jong-il,” the founder’s son and the country’s longtime leader, who died in December, leaving his own son, Kim Jong-un, in charge. What appeared to be a lack of policy coordination in Pyongyang raised questions about the “diplomatic maturity” of the young Mr. Kim and how much control he can exert over policy, said Cheong Seong-chang, an analyst at Sejong Institute. (On Sunday, Mr. Obama said it was “not clear exactly who’s calling the shots” in Pyongyang.) Still, North Korea on Tuesday challenged American negotiators to read the text of the February agreement. It called for a North Korean moratorium on “long-range missiles, not long-range missiles including satellite launches or launches using ballistic missile technology,” the spokesman said. North Korea invited observers from NASA, he said, so they could see the “peaceful nature of our satellite launch with their own eyes.” American officials accuse North Korea of reneging on a deal struck in good faith. But longtime North Korea analysts also say that it is one of the North’s negotiating tactics to abuse loopholes in the language of an agreement to strengthen its leverage or even kill the deal. “They have too often, frankly, been rewarded for engaging in provocative acts and bad behavior,” said Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communication for Mr. Obama. “We’re not going to go forward with assistance to the North Koreans or outreach to the North Koreans at a time when they’re engaging in these type of provocative actions.” Mr. Rhodes called North Korea “a very oppressive, tyrannical and backward regime.” A crucial feature of the North Korean government’s campaign to legitimize the dynastic succession and protect the vested interests of the ruling elite has been to highlight the main legacies of Kim Jong-il: the country’snuclear weaponsand long-range missile programs. The government has blamed American sanctions for food shortages and exhorted its people to be proud of being “independent” with nuclear weapons. When Mr. Obama stood near the border between North and South Korea on Sunday and criticized the North for keeping its people in poverty while spending millions of dollars developing nuclear weapons, he challenged that basic tenet of North Korean propaganda. A Web site run by the North Korean government, Uriminzokkiri, employing a term that essentially means “mind your own business,” advised Mr. Obama to “wash his own snotty nose first.”

In Adam Johnson’s novel, a young man moves up in Kim Jong-il’s power structure and then becomes a rival of the dictator.

The title of Adam Johnson’s second novel is a bit misleading. Raised in the Long Tomorrows orphanage in Chongjin, North Korea, his protagonist believes himself to be the son of the Orphan Master rather than some kid dropped off by his desperate parents. But the primary evidence for this belief — “the unrelenting way the Orphan Master singled him out for punishment” — invites other interpretations. Like the rest of the boys, he is given a name from the list of the 114 Grand Martyrs of the Revolution that will mark him as an orphan for the rest of his life. Pak Jun Do (the given name Jun Do is a homonym of “John Doe”) is appropriate for a character with such a shifting identity, someone who will become both the perpetrator and the victim of countless crimes. Conscripted into the army after a famine devastates the orphanage, Jun Do patrols the dark tunnels beneath the demilitarized zone before being reassigned to a unit that kidnaps Japanese citizens in night raids. For reasons that are never entirely explained, he is taught English, which leads to a job translating foreign radio transmissions and then to a diplomatic mission to Texas, where he makes friends with a senator’s wife. When that trip ends in disaster, he is sent to a labor camp, where he comes face to face with the diabolical Commander Ga, a national hero and Kim Jong-il’s rival for the affections of an actress called Sun Moon. Jun Do’s training in hand-to-hand tunnel combat helps him defeat Ga, whereupon he takes his place in Pyongyang as Sun Moon’s husband and the father of her children. If all this sounds convoluted, I should note that I’ve described only the first half of “The Orphan Master’s Son,” which more or less serves as a prologue to the book’s real story: Jun Do’s efforts to get Sun Moon and the children out of the country. Yet Johnson’s novel, far from being too labyrinthine, is an ingeniously plotted adventure that feels much shorter than its roughly 450 pages and offers the reader a tremendous amount of fun. This isn’t entirely a compliment. Should “fun” really be the first word to describe a novel about one of the worst places on earth? Questions of the moral responsibility attendant on certain artistic subjects can be vexing and frankly tiresome, resurrected with the appearance of every summer blockbuster about the Holocaust or some other historical horror. They would seem to be only more vexing in the case of North Korea, where the horror is still going on and so little is revealed to the outside world, even as the country passes from the “Dear Leader” to his untested son. But this matter of responsibility is largely beside the point in the case of Johnson’s novel, since he clearly intends to do his material justice. The better question is why such a talented writer has failed to make good on that intention. In his story collection, “Emporium,” and a previous novel, “Parasites Like Us,” Johnson specialized in the sort of darkly absurdist satire familiar to readers of George Saunders and Donald Antrim. “Teen Sniper,” a typical story from “Emporium,” depicts a young sharpshooter who works for the city of Oakland, Calif., assassinating dissatisfied tech company employees. In “Parasites Like Us,” an anthropologist in South Dakota disturbs an ancient burial ground, bringing about the near extinction of human life while offering disquisitions on the rapaciousness of contemporary culture. Johnson has said that his latest book began in a similarly farcical spirit, as a short story called “The Best North Korean Short Story of 2005,” inspired by the “loonier” elements of Kim Jong-il’s regime. But after some research, which included a trip to Pyongyang, Johnson realized that the “gravity” of his subject matter instilled “a sense of duty.” Having learned this, I found it dispiriting to arrive at a brutal interrogation scene in “The Orphan Master’s Son” and recognize the similarities here to the methods used by the police in the dystopian Oakland of “Teen Sniper.” More dispiriting still was seeing Kim Jong-il appear not just as a loony but as a kind of merry prankster. Even the initial conceit of the Best North Korean Short Story survives in the form of interstitial chapters in which the “official” version of Commander Ga and Sun Moon’s story is projected to all citizens by way of loudspeakers. Taken on their own, these interludes are fine exercises in dark wit, but in the context of a novel that seeks to portray a country’s suffering, they’re unconvincing. Though they occupy only a few pages, they mar the book’s overall effect. Ultimately, the one rule of art is that you’re permitted anything you can get away with. I raise the question of responsibility with respect to “The Orphan Master’s Son” because the book itself seems to raise it, and because Johnson’s prodigious talent and inventiveness aren’t enough to silence it. Johnson’s very sense of duty may have been what led him astray. In his days of tunnel patrol, Jun Do observes that the key to such work is to “never use your imagination. The darkness inside your head is something your imagination fills with stories that have nothing to do with the real darkness around you.” Johnson might have deployed more imagination, or less. In any event, he has written an exceedingly readable book that never quite shows us the real darkness — or the darkness inside his head.

Five North Korean soccer players tested positive for steroids at the Women’s World Cup. Sepp Blatter, the president of FIFA, the world governing body of soccer, said that after two players had been caught during the tournament this month, FIFA tested the rest of the North Korean squad and found three more positive results. A North Korean delegation told FIFA that the steroids had accidentally been taken with traditional Chinese medicines based on musk deer glands to treat players who were struck by lightning on June 8 during training. Meanwhile, the Colombian reserve goalkeeper Yineth Varon was provisionally suspended for failing an out-of-competition test just before the World Cup.

Analysts noted the significance of seeing Kim Jong-il and his son at a military event, as the regime tries to create an image of Kim Jong-un as a capable military leader.

SEOUL, South Korea — The North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, watched a live-fire military exercise with his youngest son and heir apparent in what was believed to be the first public appearance ofKim Jong-unsince he wasgiven the rank of four-star generallast week. The North’s official Korean Central News Agency reported on Tuesday that the two Kims were joined by other members of their family and senior officials in the new North Korean leadership. The location and date of the drill were not specified. But it was significant, analysts in Seoul said, that the younger Mr. Kim’s first public event was a military exercise, as the government tries to create the image of him as a capable military man. The event also was likely to reinforce his father’s guiding “military first” philosophy. Kim Jong-un, who is believed to be 27 or 28, was joined at the drill by Vice Marshal Ri Yong-ho, the chief of the army’s general staff, the news agency said. Both men were appointed last week as deputy chairmen of the party’s military commission, and South Korean analysts expect Vice Marshal Ri, 67, to tutor the inexperienced Mr. Kim on military and political matters as Mr. Kim prepares to eventually succeed his father. The news agency report said that when the elder Mr. Kim signaled for the live-fire drill to begin, “various ground guns showed powerful fire, while units moved in close harmony to annihilate enemies.” Also watching the military exercise were two other members of Kim Jong-il’s ruling inner circle — his sister, Kim Kyong-hui, who  was also made a four-star general last week, and her husband, Jang Song-taek, long rumored to be effectively in charge of the daily running of the government. It was unclear whether the military exercises were part of the preparations for a nationwide celebration of the 65th anniversary of the founding of the Workers’ Party. The anniversary, Oct. 10, is a major annual holiday inNorth Koreaand usually features food giveaways by the government and a huge military parade in the capital, Pyongyang. The South Korean Defense Ministry also said on Tuesday that the North seemed to be preparing a large set of war games involving army, air force and naval units. Those exercises are expected to be held at sea, off North Korea’s eastern coast. In a separate news agency report, North Korea assailed the “ceaseless war exercises being staged by the U.S. imperialists” against the North “in league with the South Korean war hawks.” The United Sates and South Korea recently concluded five days of antisubmarine drills off the South Korean coast. The statement said that such moves would only heighten tensions between the Koreas, and that the United States was an “archcriminal” that wanted to “spark off a war on the Korean Peninsula.”

The United States State Department moved Tuesday to freeze the assets of two North Korean entities believed to be involved in atomic and missile programs, in what analysts said was an attempt to raise pressure on the North to resume disarmament talks. The entities are the General Bureau of Atomic Energy, which oversees the nuclear program, and the Korea Tangun Trading Corporation, thought to support the North’s missile programs. It was unclear whether either had any assets under American  jurisdiction, but American officials said the government hoped that the move would discourage other countries from doing business withNorth Korea.

North Korea’s announcement on Friday marks the strongest signal yet from Pyongyang that it is racing to develop a second method of making nuclear bombs.

SEOUL —North Korea’s announcement on Friday that its experiment in enriching uranium is at “completion stage” marks the strongest signal yet from Pyongyang that it is racing to develop a second method of making nuclear bombs. North Korea also said it was building additional nuclear bombs with plutonium it had recently gleaned from its reactor in Yongbyon. It said it had completed reprocessing the latest batch of spent fuel unloaded from the reactor, repeating the procedure believed to have given the North enough plutonium for six to eight bombs. For years, officials in Washington and elsewhere have debated whether North Korea was pursuing a clandestine uranium-enrichment program. After years of denial, North Korea announced in April that it intended to enrich uranium. In June, it said its enrichment program was in an “experimental stage.” On Friday, it provided an update on its progress, highlighting its nuclear card at a time when Washington’s special envoy on North Korea, Stephen Bosworth, is on a high-profile trip to Northeast Asia to consult with its allies on how to force North Korea to give up itsnuclear weaponsprograms. “Experimental uranium enrichment has successfully been conducted to enter into completion phase,” the state-run Korean Central News Agency, or K.C.N.A., reported, quoting what it said was a letter the North Korean government had sent to the United Nations Security Council in response to a request for information. “Reprocessing of spent fuel rods is at its final phase and extracted plutonium is being weaponized.” The letter, whose full text was carried on K.C.N.A., gave no details. But the use of the word “experimental” suggested the country was still short of running a full-scale enrichment program. South Korean officials have said they believe North Korea first acquired uranium-enrichment technology from Pakistan. A facility that produces highly enriched uranium for weapons requires the costly installation of thousands of centrifuges. But unlike plutonium, uranium can be enriched in relatively small and inconspicuous facilities, such as an underground factory, experts said. “Our intelligence authorities will try to verify the North Korean claim, but it won’t be easy,” said Won Tae-je, a spokesman for the Defense Ministry in Seoul. He said the North’s claim could also be “just rhetoric for negotiations.” The existence of a second program to make bomb fuel would give North Korea something else to negotiate with the West. More difficult to detect or monitor than its plutonium counterpart, a uranium program poses a bigger challenge to Western officials who fear North Korea could sell such technology abroad, as it has sold some of its reactor technology to Syria. In its letter to the Security Council, North Korea also said, “We are prepared for both dialogue and sanctions.” After months of raising tensions with a long-range rocket launching in April and a nuclear test in May, North Korea has made a series of conciliatory gestures toward the United States and South Korea in recent weeks. It released two American journalists in August and agreed to hold reunions later this month of Korean families separated by the Korean War. But these gestures have not been answered with an invitation to direct talks with the United States, as North Korea has requested, nor a easing of international sanctions, which appears to have frustrated the North’s leaders, said Ryoo Kihl-jae, a North Korea expert at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. Washington and its allies insist that Pyongyang return to six-nation talks, which also include China, South Korea, Russia and Japan, in discussions on ending the North’s nuclear weapons programs. “Impatience is the word that first came to my mind when I read the statement and the North’s recent moves,” he said. “They are almost begging for dialogue.” Kim Yong-hyun, a North Korea specialist at Dongguk University, said he felt the North was trying to assert itself in an effort to raise the stakes in the region as Mr. Bosworth talks with allies. In Beijing on Friday, Mr. Bosworth said the North Korean action “reconfirms the necessity to maintain a coordinated position on the need for complete, verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” Reuters reported. In Tokyo, the Japanese foreign minister, Hirofumi Nakasone, said his government “will definitely not tolerate North Korea possessing nuclear weapons.” And Moon Tae-young, a spokesman for the South Korean Foreign Ministry, said: “We will deal with North Korea’s threats and provocative acts in a stern and consistent manner.” North Korea on Friday reiterated that it quit six-nation talks because they were used for “wanton violation” of its “sovereignty and right for peaceful development,” and called again for direct talks with Washington. “We have never objected the denuclearizing of the Korean Peninsula,” K.C.N.A. quoted the letter as saying. “It depends strictly on the United States’ nuclear policy on Korea.”

There are reasons to negotiate with North Korea, but diplomats will never get the regime to give up its nuclear weapons.
==::==
2009-08-10T00:00:00Z
==::==
Bill Clinton’s trip to Pyongyang and the release of the American journalists  confirmed what many observers have suspected since early July: North Korea is indicating its willingness to re-start talks with the United States. There are reasons why Washington should not  rush to the negotiation table immediately, but few people doubt that these talks will start relatively soon. The negotiations are likely to be characterized as talks about getting the North to give up its nuclear weapons. But one should not be misled: No amount of diplomatic dealing can achieve that goal. North Korea’s leaders have good reasons to retain their nuclear program. First, they need a deterrent against foreign attack. Second, they need nuclear arms for domestic purposes: The nuclear weapons program is perhaps the only visible success of Kim Jong-il’s rule. (It also serves as a helpful  excuse for the regime’s economic calamities). But, above all, the nuclear program is  a powerful diplomatic tool. North Korea cannot survive without foreign aid,  which the regime uses to support those social groups whose loyalty is vital for  internal stability. And  nothing can rival a latent nuclear threat as means to obtain foreign aid. It is often argued that North Korea might choose to surrender its nuclear weapons in exchange for a massive aid program. But Pyongyang cannot use the aid to kick-start its economy, because its leaders believe that economic reforms will be politically ruinous.  Chinese-style reforms require a great deal of political liberalization.  The spread of  information about South Korea’s economic success and political freedom would deliver a mortal blow to the regime’s legitimacy. In this situation, the most rational policy choice of the tiny Pyongyang elite  is to avoid domestic reforms, keep interaction with the outside world at a bare minimum and, of course, engage in  nuclear blackmail. The regime can alternate threats  with hints at a possible solution, and even make promises of a complete de-nuclearization at some future point. The North has played this game for nearly two decades,  with remarkable success. As long as the country remains under  the current regime’s control,  negotiations are not going to produce a non-nuclear North Korea. Nevertheless, there are at least four major reasons why North Korea should be engaged. First, some useful compromises are achievable. It is possible to devise an agreement that would diminish the likelihood of nuclear proliferation by Pyongyang. After all, North Korean leaders understand that their current stockpile of weapons-grade plutonium is sufficient as a deterrent and blackmail tool, so additional production would not make much difference. They might even agree to demolish their Yongbyon research facilities, if the promised payoff is sufficiently high. Second, talks lessen tensions and decrease the likelihood of a confrontation. Of course, Pyongyang diplomats might at any time resort to their favorite trick: Walk away from negotiations, launch a chain of provocations to increase tensions, and then return to negotiations in expectations of greater payoffs. But while talks are continuing, an accidental confrontation is less likely. Third, talks will provide a line of communication that might become vital, since big changes are looming in Pyongyang: Recent photos leave no doubt that Kim Jong Il’s health has deteriorated considerably. Perhaps the most important reason why Pyongyang should be engaged is the long-term domestic impact of talks. Negotiations and aid create an environment where contacts between the isolated population  and the outside world steadily increase, exposing the total lie in which North Koreans have to live. In the long run, this  will undermine the regime, bringing the country’s radical transformation  —  and, probably, a solution of the nuclear issue. Nonetheless, future talks should be conducted without unrealistic expectations. There will be no breakthrough as long as the present regime runs the country. To keep Pyongyang engaged, something has to be given, but excessive generosity is not advisable: It will merely provoke more exercises in blackmail. There  also is no need to  hurry. It’s time to realize that the North Korean problem has no quick fixes, but  it can  —  and should  —  be managed.
