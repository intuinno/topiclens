The review’s conclusion was that aid money from the United Nations Development Program had been used for intended projects.

UNITED NATIONS— American allegations thatNorth Koreaduped the United Nations Development Program by diverting aid money for its own needs are not supported by any evidence, according to a lengthy external review released Monday. There was no sign that millions of dollars were mismanaged, diverted elsewhere or unaccounted for, the report said, countering accusations made in early 2007 by the United States Mission to the United Nations. Although the report acknowledged that some information the panel had sought was unavailable, the review’s conclusion was that the money had been “used for the purposes of the projects.” The controversy surrounding the accusations led the development program to suspend its operations in North Korea in March 2007. They have remained suspended because of differences over whether the government should choose local employees who work for the agency. The review was conducted by a three-member panel, led by Miklos Nemeth, a former Hungarian prime minister, and was presented Monday by Kemal Dervis, a former Turkish finance minister who leads the development program. Mr. Dervis said the panel members preferred not to comment publicly. At the news conference, when asked whether he thought the accusations emerged out of the political dispute over the Bush administration’s negotiations with North Korea, Mr. Dervis said he would not comment on internal government ideological battles. “All these allegations, clearly — when you compare it to what is in the report — are either vastly exaggerated or stem from misunderstandings or some of them may be from ill intent,” he said. The accusations were raised by Mark D. Wallace, who leads the department at the United States Mission that evaluates United Nations management practices. In early 2007, he said millions of dollars in program money had been used to buy real estate abroad and to pay a North Korean financial agent responsible for sales of missiles and arms. He compared the program to the multibillion-dollar oil-for-food scandal in Iraq before the invasion and suggested that the United Nations money might have helped finance North Korea’s nuclear program. Zalmay Khalilzad, the American ambassador, said his staff was studying the report, but noted that it was the American Mission’s responsibility to pursue any allegations about the abuse of money, especially since United States taxpayers helped underwrite the United Nations budget. The United States supports all recommendations in the report that would increase transparency and accountability, he said. The report, which surveyed the disbursement of more than $23 million between 1999 and 2007, recommended that the development program pay closer attention when it adapts its general guidelines to “a challenging environment” like North Korea. The dense 353-page report appeared to concur with what the program had maintained all along, that the American allegations were baseless. But it recognized some sloppy practices, like tossing $3,500 in defaced counterfeit $100 bills into the bottom of its safe in Pyongyang and forgetting about them for more than a decade. Some confusion stemmed from the fact that the North Koreans used the development program’s name on international money transfers — hoping the funds would come under less scrutiny that way. Such tactics were beyond the program’s control, the study concluded. Among other key findings, the report said that the former development program operations manager in North Korea who was a source for many of the allegations, Artjon Shkurtaj, lacked credibility and “proved to be an evasive witness.” Mr. Shkurtaj issued a statement via e-mail objecting to not having been shown the report before it was released. He said he still hoped for a ruling from the United Nations Ethics Office on whether he had been fired in retaliation for being a whistle-blower. The report dismissed accusations that the development program had retaliated against him.

North Korea warned the United States, however, that the real bargaining over its nuclear disarmament had only begun.

SEOUL, South Korea, July 16 — United Nations inspectors have confirmed thatNorth Koreahas shut down its weapons-making nuclear reactor, theInternational Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations’ nuclear monitoring arm, said Monday. North Korea warned the United States, though, that the real bargaining over its nuclear disarmament had only begun. The much delayed shutdown was brought about with a series of financial and diplomatic concessions. The road ahead will not be easy, officials and experts said. Six-nation talks are set to resume Wednesday in Beijing to try to persuade North Korea to start disabling the closed facilities and to disclose all its nuclear materials and facilities, in return for one million tons of heavy fuel oil and other economic aid and diplomatic incentives. “I certainly have to anticipate there will be problems, because I never expected it would take until July to get this first step done,” said Christopher R. Hill, an assistant secretary of state who is the American envoy to the talks, referring to North Korea’s agreement in February to turn off the reactor by mid-April. “It’s a reminder of how difficult other steps will be,” he said in Seoul, where he met with South Korean officials in preparation for the Beijing talks. “But I think we are off to a good start.” Mohamed ElBaradei, director general of the atomic energy agency, said Monday in Bangkok that his 10-member team of inspectors visiting the nuclear complex at Yongbyon had verified that the reactor had been switched off, as North Korea announced over the weekend. “After tomorrow, we will be able to report, hopefully, that all of the five facilities have been shut down,” he said. He was referring to five facilities that North Korea has agreed to shut down under the February agreement with the United States, South Korea, China and Russia in return for an initial shipment of 50,000 tons of fuel oil. They include a radiochemical laboratory that extracts plutonium from spent fuel rods from the five-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon, and two new, bigger reactors under construction nearby. The Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Sunday that that outcome would depend on “what practical measures the U.S. and Japan, in particular, will take to roll back their hostile policies” toward North Korea. North Korea said it had allowed the atomic energy agency’s team in not to inspect its nuclear sites, but only to “verify and monitor” the shutdown. That restriction would not allow the agency to investigate independently how much plutonium and how many atomic weapons North Korea has produced at the Yongbyon complex and what it has done with the uranium-enrichment equipment that American officials say it bought from Pakistan. “There will be a lot of difficulty over the highly enriched uranium issue,” said Yoon Duk-min, a senior analyst at the Institute for Foreign Affairs and National Security in Seoul. “It is difficult to confirm whether North Korea has a uranium program unless it decides to be transparent. “No one knows how many centrifuges they have built so far. They can hide them in an underground tunnel.” A nuclear bomb can be built with either plutonium or uranium. North Korea admits to extracting plutonium from its Yongbyon reactor, but American officials have said since 2002 that North Korea is running a clandestine uranium-enrichment program as well. Even if North Korea disables its nuclear facilities, Mr. Yoon and other experts said, it will probably refuse to discuss giving up its nuclear arsenal during six-party talks. It is more likely to insist on separate talks with the United States on arms reduction, including the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea, they said.

Christopher R. Hill said he wanted to speed up six-nation talks aimed at dismantling North Korea’s nuclear program.

TOKYO, June 21 — The United States’ chief nuclear negotiator on Thursday began a surprise two-day visit toNorth Korea, saying he wanted to speed up six-nation talks aimed at dismantling North Korea’s nuclear program. In the first visit to Pyongyang by a senior American official in nearly five years, the envoy, Christopher R. Hill, was scheduled to meet senior North Korean officials, including his counterpart, Kim Kye-gwan, for one-on-one talks. Mr. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs, planned to spend the night in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, before leaving on Friday. Television images showed Mr. Hill being warmly greeted at Pyongyang’s airport by Ri Gun, the North’s deputy nuclear negotiator. “We want to get the six-party process moving,” Mr. Hill said. “We hope that we can make up for some of the time that we lost this spring, and so I’m looking forward to good discussions about that.” Mr. Hill’s trip was organized in such secrecy and so suddenly that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice did not alert  regional allies, Japan and South Korea, until just before his departure from Tokyo, where he had been visiting. Mr. Hill flew from Japan to South Korea, and then to Pyongyang aboard a small jet. “We’re all waiting for you,” Mr. Ri told Mr. Hill, as the two  could be seen smiling and chatting at the airport. His agenda will include trying to persuade North Korea to fulfill a commitment it made in February to slow down its main nuclear reactor, whose spent fuel has enabled the country to manufacture plutonium and gain the fuel for eight or more nuclear weapons, according to American intelligence estimates. In the next step, the North is supposed to provide the United States and the other participants in the six-nation negotiations on the issue — Japan, South Korea, Russia and China — with a detailed list of all of its nuclear programs and facilities. The Bush administration is also considering authorizing Mr. Hill to offer to buy from the North Koreans nuclear equipment that they are believed to have purchased several years ago from Abdul Qadeer Khan, a Pakistani nuclear engineer. That equipment could conceivably give the North a second path to building a bomb by enriching uranium.

BEIJING, May 30 — Arms control negotiators from the United States and China met here today in an effort to revive a stalled agreement under whichNorth Koreawould begin to dismantle its nuclear weapons program. The top United States negotiator on North Korea, Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill, met his Chinese counterpart, Wu Dawei, as efforts continued to clear a financial deadlock that North Korea has insisted be resolved before it shuts its main plutonium-producing reactor. Pyongyang agreed in February that it would shut its reactor at Yongbyon by April 14 on the condition that $25 million held in accounts linked to North Korea at a Macao bank be returned to the North. The United States has been unable to find a bank or financial institution willing to transfer the money to North Korea and Pyongyang has kept the reactor in service. “Once they have their funds from the bank, they are prepared to do their part of the bargain, which is to shut down the Yongbyon plant,” Mr. Hill said after the meeting today, The Associated Press reported. He declined to give any details of the talks. The funds were frozen in September 2005, when the Treasury Department accused the bank, Banco Delta Asia, of complicity in money laundering and counterfeit-currency trafficking on behalf of North Korea. After taking a tough stance toward the bank in what it said was an effort to curtail North Korea’s illicit financial activities, the Bush administration decided to return the money to secure the disarmament agreement. But there was no reprieve for the bank. In March, the Treasury Department ruled that Banco Delta Asia was a money-laundering concern and barred it from dealing with the American financial system. The ruling left international banks unwilling to handle what they regarded as tainted funds, financial and political analysts said. “It has proved to be very difficult for any banks to move the money because of various legal issues,” Mr. Hill said before the meeting. “We are doing all we can to resolve this. We will get it done but it would be helpful if North Korea got on with their task as well.” Wachovia, one of the biggest banks in the United States, said this month that the State Department had asked it to transfer the money. Mr. Hill said that despite the delay in returning the money, there was reason for optimism. “The positive sign is the North Koreans have continued to indicate they are prepared to do what they are supposed to do,” he said. “The problem is that we have really had trouble resolving this issue in Macao.” The Treasury Department ruling on Banco Delta Asia arose from long-running criminal investigations that uncovered a money trail leading to Macao, where criminals linked to North Korea were laundering money, said current and former Bush administration officials who were involved in tracking illicit financial activity linked to the North. Washington has not made public any evidence that implicates Banco Delta Asia in any financial crime. The bank and its owner, Stanley Au, a prominent Macao businessman and politician, have denied any wrongdoing and are challenging the Treasury ruling. In a May 2 petition supporting that challenge, Mr. Au wrote that in a meeting with American government agents in 1994, he offered to cut ties with North Korean customers. The bank had detected counterfeit United States currency in deposits paid into the accounts of North Korean customers and had reported that to the Macao police, he said. “They said they would like us to continue to deal with them as it was better that we conducted this business rather than another financial entity that may not have been as cooperative with the United States,” Mr. Au wrote. Mr. Au noted that his bank was “by no means” the only bank outside North Korea doing business with entities from the North. He wrote that about two dozen foreign banks, including several major international ones, did business with the North before the United States Treasury moved against Delta Asia in September 2005.

North Korea reiterated that it would allow international nuclear inspectors into the country as soon as it could confirm that funds frozen in a Macao bank had been released. According to the official Korean Central News Agency, Ri Je-son, the director general of North Korea’s Atomic Energy Department, delivered that message in a response to a request by the International Atomic Energy Agency to send inspectors. North Korea repeated that it remained committed to a Feb. 13 agreement under which it would allow inspectors in and shut down its Yongbyon nuclear plant in return for energy aid.

A carefully monitored visit to North Korea offered hints of why its leaders might be eager to resume international aid and trade.

PYONGYANG, North Korea — Girls’ soccer teams waged a fierce battle outside a huge gymnasium. Two young brides, one resplendent in a white gown and the other in deep pink, married sweethearts in a snowy square. Parents pulled toddlers on plastic sleds. Pedestrians lined up at kiosks to buy baked sweet potatoes and pancakes. A six-day visit to Pyongyang,North Korea’s capital, that ended last Tuesday offered carefully monitored glimpses of a land where reality and fantasy are routinely conflated. While there were no obvious signs of impending collapse or political intrigue swirling around the fate of North Korea’s ailing leader, the visit offered hints of why the North might be particularly eager now to resume international aid and trade. For nearly four years, an unrelenting barrage of government propaganda has promised that North Korea will be strong and prosperous by 2012, the centennial of the birth of Kim Il-sung, the nation’s founder and the father of the current leader, Kim Jong-il. That is now 18 months away. And prosperous is the last word one would use to describe North Korea’s shuttered factories, skimpy harvests and stunted children. Perhaps with that deadline in mind, North Korea’s leaders last week made what might be a bid to reduce their isolation. They offered concessions that could help open up and limit the country’s increasingly sophisticated nuclear program. And after promising to retaliate militarily should South Korea renew artillery drills near disputed waters, they have reacted — so far — only with words. But North Korea has made conciliatory gestures before, to extract aid at times of economic need or political transition, only to turn hostile later. Of the nation’s 24 million citizens, the three million  in Pyongyang are the most privileged. North Koreans need a special permit to live or come here. Still, signs of hardship are evident. Commuters crammed into decrepit electric buses, packed as tightly as boxes of toothpicks. Pedestrians bowed beneath huge bundles strapped to their backs, apparently stuffed with goods for trade in private markets that have eclipsed the ill-supplied state stores. Most were women; one collapsed on the sidewalk under the weight of her load. Economists say coal production is, at best, half that of two decades ago, and Pyongyang has regular power shortages. At the elite Foreign Language Revolution School, students warmed themselves around  stoves fed by coal or wood. In much of the city, residents report only a few hours of electricity daily. New apartment buildings — apparently for officials — grace the city center. But the pyramid-shaped, 105-story  Ryugyong Hotel remains a shell nearly 25 years after construction began. While it was recently sheathed in glass, other abandoned construction projects scar roads outside the city. Elsewhere, especially in northern provinces, residents report that child beggars haunt street markets, families scavenge hillsides for sprouts and mushrooms and workers at state enterprises receive nominal salaries, at best. Workers in Pyongyang are said to be much better compensated. Signs of that relative good fortune were evident on Pyongyang’s streets. Some pedestrians chatted on cellphones, something unknown just two years ago. Koryolink, a cellphone network controlled by an Egyptian firm, has 310,000 North Korean subscribers. North Koreans can call only one another, but the network is expanding fast. Residents report more cars and traffic lights than three years ago, although traffic remains sparse. Most pedestrians appeared well fed. Although malnutrition has improved in the past decade,  one in three North Korean children is stunted, and nearly one in five is underweight, according to the World Food Program. Residents of the Pyongyang area are the nation’s best nourished. North Korea’s isolation is striking from the moment of arrival at Pyongyang’s utilitarian airport. With a 40-plane, primarily Russian-made fleet, Air Koryo schedules just two daily outbound flights, to Beijing and to Vladivostok in far eastern Russia. Although visitors were allowed to bring laptops, inspectors immediately confiscated cellphones. Journalists are rarely granted visas to North Korea, one of the world’s most secretive and militaristic societies. The government allowed two journalists to accompany Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a former  ambassador to the United Nations, on a private mission to meet senior officials in Pyongyang. Mr. Richardson sought to reduce the threat of conflict between North and South Korea and to persuade the North to abandon its aggressive behavior if it wants outside assistance. Visiting Pyongyang as an outsider is a bit like entering a parallel reality. Official escorts stuck to visitors like Velcro. The rules were clear: No interviews without permission. No exploring beyond the hotel parking lot. Everyone was closely watched, with tactics reminiscent of a bad cold war spy movie. Opposite a journalist’s spacious room at the mostly empty Potonggang Hotel, men with briefcases left keys dangling in doors and appeared to rotate shifts. Other guests warned that dining room tables were bugged and that a dark, out-of-place wall panel was in fact a two-way mirror. Calls from the United States were blocked. Outgoing overseas calls cost $8.27 a minute. Some events seemed obviously staged. On a dazzlingly sunny Saturday, a crowd packed the auditorium of Pyongyang’s ornate central library for a lecture on the life of Kim Jong-il’s mother. Nearly every seat in the reading room was also taken. When one reader nodded off, a watchful monitor quickly poked him. But the Foreign Ministry also showed surprising flexibility at times, allowing visits to the foreign language school, a crowded subway station and a silk-thread factory. Long-time visitors say they see a growing openness to journalists. State stores were off limits, either because barren shelves hinted at economic difficulties or because only lucky government-coupon holders could take advantage of their artificially low prices. Window-shopping only, journalists were warned. Better-stocked but costlier private markets were also out of bounds. Hundreds have sprung up nationwide, but officials play down their importance because they flout the  socialist credo. One, the huge, arch-roofed Unification Market in Pyongyang, sports row after row of stalls. Merchants say three-fourths of the wares come from China. With paltry harvests, inflation offood pricesis a chronic problem. Last month, the World Food Program reported that at that market a kilogram of rice, or 2.2 pounds, cost $10, about 10 times the price in Beijing. By the agency’s rough estimates, a typical household’s income would allow one person to eat two and a half cups of rice a day, assuming he had no other expenses. North Koreans pride themselves on juche, or self-reliance, and government officials greeted Mr. Richardson with declarations of a thriving society. “Everything is going well,” Vice President Kim Yong-dae assured the governor before reporters were shooed out of a meeting. “Thanks to our powerful military deterrence,” he said, “we can now concentrate on development” and achieve prosperity by 2012. But privately, Mr. Richardson said, officials acknowledge that the country is desperate for fuel, food and an easing of economic sanctions imposed after North Korea’s missile and nuclear tests, beginning roughly five years ago. Some North Korea analysts warn that unless aid and trade resume, the North may raise cash by selling nuclear technology and materials to Iran, Syria or others — if it has not already. Interviews in the past six months with nearly 20 North Koreans who recently left for China, including several Communist Party members, suggest that faith in the leadership’s economic policies is shaken, if not lost. North Koreans know well that South Koreans live much better, while their own government demands constant sacrifice. A few criticize the military’s pre-eminence, and hope that Kim Jong-un, Kim Jong-il’s son and chosen successor, will shift policy. “I heard a rumor that he said we have more bullets than food. So maybe he will be a good leader and feed the people,” one 59-year-old North Korean trader said, hopefully, in an interview last month in China. But most seemed to support Kim Jong-il’s 15-year-old “military-first” policies. They regard the United States as an implacable enemy and South Korea as an American tool, barred by Washington from uniting with the North. They insist that Japan’s 35-year occupation of the peninsula, followed by the Korean War, proves the need for an invincible defense. Billboards, patriotic songs, newspapers and movies continually reinforce that message. Every North Korean man spends up to 10 years in the military. Soldiers were spotted helping out at a Pyongyang construction site and heading through a nearby village toting shovels as a loudspeaker mounted on a tree blared patriotic messages. “Even if we don’t eat, we give the military everything we can,” said a former humanities professor from the northern city of Chongjin, who now works as a maid in China but plans to return home. “Nuclear weapons mean we cannot be invaded. I really want to say that. We cannot be touched.” At one Pyongyang subway stop, called Prosperity Station, commuters read news on the threat of military conflict with South Korea from newspaper pages posted on a stand-up carousel. “We want peace,” one man declared passionately. “But we are not afraid of war. We are ready for anything.” Such statements aside, he and other residents were surprisingly friendly to journalists. So were government escorts. The six-day visit ended with a cognac-fueled celebration in the hotel’s karaoke bar in which the North Koreans belted out “You Are My Destiny”  and Korean love songs. The days were marked by odes to Kim Jong-il. Choi Hyok, 43, the rail-thin chief engineer at the Kim Jong-suk Silk Factory, which is named after the chairman’s mother, recalled Kim Jong-il’s visit in January 2009. “I felt like I had come out of the darkness and into the light,” he said. Nam Dae-yong, 20, a geology student at Kim Il-sung University, marveled at 2,000 new desktop computers installed in April. “This is a very good present from Chairman Kim Jong-il,” she said. The university is a showpiece. So is the silk factory, with its well-oiled machinery and 2,000 women at work in blue, pink and green scarves. Economists estimate that three of four North Korean factories are idle, lacking power and materials. “Everyone knows the environment,” the former humanities professor said of her university in Chongjin. “No electricity, no light, no heat. The government doesn’t give anything, so we have to ask the parents for money.” “People talk a lot about 2012, how we will become a strong and prosperous country,” one 45-year-old trader from Hwanghae Province told the advocacy group Human Rights Watch last month. “If we find a gold mine, yes, I guess it would happen.” “Nobody really believes it,” he said. “We just get by.”

SEOUL — Last week, Siegfried Hecker, a former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory was invited to visit the North Korean nuclear research center in Yongbyon. He was shown a uranium enrichment plant whose sophistication and likely output is well in excess of what most experts suspected about the North Korean uranium program. Then on Tuesday, North Korean artillery shelled a South Korean island, inflicting heavy damage. The world  is likely to say that the North Koreans are again acting “irrationally.” But this is not the case — they are a very rational regime, actually the world’s most Machiavellian. North Korean leaders are sending a message. For the last two years, both Washington and Seoul have tried to ignore them, so now they use both artillery and  centrifuges to say: “We are here, we are dangerous, and we cannot be ignored. We can make a lot of trouble, but also we behave reasonably if rewarded generously enough.” Since 1994, U.S. policy toward Pyongyang has been based most of the time on the  assumption that North Korea can be persuaded and bribed into surrendering its nuclear program. It is an illusion, of course: The survival of the North Korean regime depends to a large extent on its blackmail diplomacy. There has never been a chance that it would surrender its nuclear program, which alone makes it possible to extract sufficient aid from the outside world. Finally, after two nuclear tests and a number of broken agreements, Washington has realized that no amount of engagement is going to produce a nuclear-free North Korea. So nowadays the major hope is sanctions. Many in Washington still entertain the idea that a tough sanctions regime would make North Korea surrender its nukes — or, perhaps, bring about regime collapse. It might take a few years before it becomes clear that sanctions will not work either. The major — but by no means only — reason is that sanctions are quietly sabotaged by China. China believes that domestic instability in North Korea constitutes a greater threat to its interest than the North Korean nuclear program, so it does not want to see Pyongyang cornered. The news from North Korea confirms that sanctions are not successful. Dr. Hecker was impressed by the scale and sophistication of the enrichment plant, and the general economic situation — albeit very bad by the normal standards — has clearly improved in the last years. However, the stubborn refusal of the United States and South Korea to provide aid and concessions makes Pyongyang leaders uneasy — not because they are facing an immediate threat of collapse, but because sanctions make them increasingly dependent on China, their only sponsor. And this goes against Pyongyang’s basic diplomatic principle: Since the times of the Sino-Soviet quarrel of the 1960s, it has always relied on two or three sponsors, preferably antagonistic and hence easier to manipulate. So the North Korean leaders decided that this was the time to remind the world of their existence. They chose soft spots of their adversaries (and potential sponsors). The Americans were reminded that sanctions or not, the North Korean nuclear program is steadily advancing, thus increasing the likelihood of proliferation. The South Koreans were reminded that their major city lies within the shooting range of North Korean artillery (and also that their economy is dependent on international markets, which do not take news of shelling favorably). North Korean leaders know that they are safe from military retaliation — a large-scale war against the North is winnable but prohibitively costly, while small-scale strikes against their military installations would only kill common soldiers, whose lives are expendable. So what can be done? The easiest reply is to hold steadfast, and do not bow to the pressure. This may sound great, but this policy is actually quite dangerous. A few more years of doing nothing will mean not only more provocations, but also a considerable increase in North Korea’s nuclear capabilities,  missile technology and, perhaps, proliferation. In other words, waiting is not a solution. In the short term, the answer would seem to be negotiations aimed at freezing the North Korean nuclear program — for a price, of course. It should be done with a clear understanding that negotiations, even if a deal is reached, will merely buy time and make the problems less acute. So long as the Kim family stays in power — and it could be around for a long time — North Korea will remain a problem with no diplomatic solution. It survives by making trouble, since it has to make trouble just to stay afloat. Andrei Lankovis a professor at Kookmin University in Seoul and the author of several books on North Korea.

Kim Jong-un, the son of North Korea’s leader, is thought to have been the force behind a new wave of aggressive actions and appears to be in line to succeed his father.

WASHINGTON — In the 16 years since he assumed his father’s role asNorth Korea’s sole leader,Kim Jong-ilhas been denounced by the United States as a vicious dictator who starves his people, runs gulags, sets off nuclear tests and orders attacks on South Korean ships. But now the Obama administration is concerned that what comes next could be worse. What is coming, they fear, is Mr. Kim’s third son,Kim Jong-un, who is thought to have been the moving force behind a new wave of aggressive actions by the North andappears to be in line to succeed his father. On Thursday night, Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates — who took an intense interest in North Korea during his many years as an intelligence officer and then the director of the C.I.A. — offered an on-the-record glimpse of the administration’s internal analysis, saying that the North’s provocative actions were indications that the dictator’s son “has to earn his stripes with the North Korean military.” He voiced suspicions that it was the succession struggle — in which Kim Jong-il is helping to build the credentials of his son, who is either 27 or 28 — thatcould explain the attack on a South Korean frigate, the Cheonan, that killed 46 South Korean sailors in March. “My worry is that that’s behind a provocation like the sinking of the Cheonan,” Mr. Gates said during an appearance in San Francisco. In a question-and-answer series after his speech, the defense secretary, echoing statements by American military leaders, said that until the North Korean succession was settled, the Cheonan sinking could turn out to be the first of several such attacks. Last week a South Korean fishing boat was seized in disputed waters, and the North Koreans, apparently reacting to recently completed military exercises conducted by the United States and the South Koreans, raked the area with gunfire. The action was mostly symbolic; there were no other forces nearby. “We’re very concerned that this may not be the only provocation from the North Koreans,” said Mr. Gates, who, along with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, held talks with their South Korean counterparts last month. But Mr. Gates also characterized the North right now as “very frail,” apparently referring to continuing reports of widespread hunger and the outcry from a failed effort early this year to revalue its nearly worthless currency, which wiped out what few savings North Koreans could scrape together. That effort was later reversed when it appeared likely to set off uprisings. Next month the North Koreans are expected to convene a meeting of the country’s top political leadership. There has been widespread speculation in the Japanese and South Korean media that the younger Mr. Kim will make his debut, either as the designated successor to his father, or in some central role in the country’s politburo or its most important institution, the National Defense Commission. One leading theory is that if the elder Mr. Kim, who suffered a stroke in 2008 and appears to have only partly recovered, dies in the next few years, the country would be run by a regent, probably his brother-in-law, Jang Song-taek. But the younger Mr. Kim, who was briefly educated in Switzerland as a teenager, would be the designated leader, and presumably would ultimately take charge. Many analysts are focusing on a possible transition in 2012, the 100th anniversary of the birth of North Korea’s founder, Kim Il-sung, the father of the current leader and grandfather of the presumed successor. He died in 1994. “You hear all these theories about how Kim Jong-un is aggressively pressing for more attacks on South Korean targets, or maybe even striking out at its allies,” said Jonathan Pollack, a professor at theNaval War College in Rhode Islandand one of the country’s leading North Korea watchers. “And it’s easy to believe, because this is what happened 30 years ago,” when Kim Jong-il, also young, untested and unpredictable, was thought to be responsible for many North Korean attacks. It was presumed that the elder Mr. Kim, like his son now, was looking to win the allegiance of the North Korean military, which is constantly trying to bolster its image as an unbeatable, nuclear-armed force. “But remember, we don’t even know what the kid looks like, or even exactly how old he is,” Mr. Pollack said. “So this is a mix of intelligence and speculation, like everything else in North Korea.” Among the speculation is that the elder Mr. Kim may be restraining his son from conducting a range of other attacks, much as he himself was restrained decades ago. But so far, there is scant evidence that the younger Mr. Kim has any independent authority. “The last transition took place over a period of 10 years or so, during which Kim Il-sung gradually gave authority to Kim Jong-il,” said Joel Wit, a former State Department negotiator with the North who founded the Web site38 North, which follows the country's murky politics. “But there is no evidence that the son has that authority now.” At the same time, he said, “There is a sense that if the Obama administration doesn’t want to negotiate with Kim Jong-il these days, they could be positively nostalgic for him in a few years.” Mr. Gates, in his comments in San Francisco, noted that the United States had been working with China to restrain North Korea’s adventurism, but he seemed persuaded by China’s declarations that when it comes to succession, Beijing has limited clout. Moreover, there is some evidence that the Chinese are trying to protect their lines of communication to the North Koreans. China’s leadership seems even more focused than ever on preserving stability in the North, fearing that a collapse now would send millions of refugees across the border and could ultimately result in a scramble for control that could put South Korean forces — and their American allies — on the Chinese border. Without referring specifically to those possibilities, Mr. Gates said that fear of a collapse was “one of the reasons why they are unwilling to put much pressure on that regime, because maybe they, even more than we, believe it’s very frail.”

North Koreamade a rare appearance before the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva on Monday, where it defended itself against accusations of abuses like public executions, torture and allowing its population to go hungry. One delegate said political prisoners did not exist in North Korea. Regarding public executions, a North Korean official said they occurred only “in very exceptional cases” and at the request of victim’s relatives. The North Korean ambassador, Ri Tcheul, said the nation’s food crisis had improved. “The issue of serious malnutrition is a thing of the past,” he told the 47-nation council.  The United Nations estimates that 8.7 million people in North Korea need food.

President Obama is sending Stephen Bosworth, a veteran diplomat, to Pyongyang to see if the North will return to the international disarmament talks that it abandoned this year.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — President Obama is sending a veteran diplomat toNorth Koreaon Tuesday for the highest-profile talks between the United States and North Korea since he took office pledging to reach out to America’s adversaries. A basic question is whether the diplomat, Stephen W. Bosworth, can extract a firm commitment from the North to rejoin nuclear disarmament talks and whether this time North Korea is serious about peace on the peninsula. Mr. Bosworth is scheduled to fly from a United States military base near Seoul to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, to see if the North will return to the international disarmament talks that itabandonedthis year. Neither side has said whom Mr. Bosworth will meet with during his three-day visit, although he is widely expected to sit down with Kang Sok-ju, the first vice foreign minister. He is considered the chief foreign policy strategist for the country’s reclusive leader, Kim Jong-il. “The main question is whether Bosworth will meet with Chairman Kim Jong-il,” said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul. “Such a meeting would demonstrate that both the U.S. and North Korea intend to resolve the nuclear issue.” American officials would say only that the North Koreans had promised high-level meetings for Mr. Bosworth. The State Department, in briefing reporters before his trip, said that Mr. Bosworth had a narrow mission: to find out whether the North would return to the stalled disarmament talks. The State Department also said that he would be offering no inducements to lure North Korea back to the negotiating table. Chinese and North Korean officials have suggested that Pyongyang might be willing to return, but American officials said that Mr. Bosworth did not know what the North would decide. Mr. Bosworth’s visit comes  after a year of threatening rhetoric and rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula.

Ten years after rejecting the nuclear test ban treaty, the U.S. has every reason to ratify it.
==::==
2009-10-22T00:00:00Z
==::==
Ten years ago, the Senate rejected a treaty to ban nuclear testing. To many, this was shocking. After more than 1,000 tests there was nothing of military value left for the United States to learn unless it wanted new warheads. The Cold War had been over for a decade and the U.S. arsenal already had more warheads than imaginable targets. American conventional superiority was enormous and growing. Now, as the debate begins anew, in a world where so much has changed, we are about to learn whether this time we can let go of the past. In 1999, there were technical reasons to worry whether a testing ban could be verified and whether American weapons could remain reliable indefinitely without testing. These worries  have been erased. A global monitoring system has been built that can detect an explosion as small as one-tenth of a kiloton, and 10 times smaller in many critical regions. North Korea’s small underground test in 2006 was instantly detected by 22 of the system’s nearly 300 stations, including one 7,000 kilometers away. Within two hours, the data had been analyzed and sent to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty’s (CTBT) member states. Will there ever be 100 percent certainty? No, but 99.9 percent is good enough. When  —  if  —  the treaty enters into force, nothing of military significance will be able to elude the completed system. A bigger concern a decade ago was whether the United States could develop a computer powerful enough to assure the reliability of the warheads without testing them. We can do that, said the scientists, if we can reach a goal of 100 teraflops (one hundred trillion floating operations per second). It was a big stretch. One of those who helped set the goal later remarked: “I remember handing my answer in, thinking that they would kick me out of the room because it was insane at the time.” Not surprisingly, senators found this a slim reed to rely on. As it happened, scientists reached the goal in 2005 and blasted past it. Last year, the U.S. Department of Energy announced that its newest supercomputer had achieved 10 times more. That leaves geopolitics. The CTBT requires that 44 named states ratify the treaty before it can come into force. In addition to the United States, eight remain.  Among them, Indonesia has announced that when the U.S. ratifies, it will immediately follow. China is expected to do so as well. Once it does, India should be able to fulfill the pledge it made to the United Nations 11 years ago, that it would not be one of a handful of states to stand in the way. If India ratifies, Pakistan will. That leaves Egypt, Israel, North Korea and Iran. Egypt has linked its approval to a Mideast peace, but as a leader of the Non-Aligned Movement  —  whose members have overwhelmingly approved the treaty  —  it faces pressures from that direction. And, if the United States has ratified, it would face pressure  from the provider of the annual aid that keeps its economy afloat. If only North Korea and Iran remain, the more than 160 nations that have joined the treaty will not allow them to block it. An amendment will be drawn that allows provisional entry into force without them. But another outcome is possible: If the United States and others ratify the treaty, pressure can be put on Iran to prove that when it says it has no intention of developing nuclear weapons, it means it. A signature on a treaty alone wouldn’t stop cheating, but it would be one more legal norm boxing Tehran in. Iran uses the areas of vagueness in the Nonproliferation Treaty to skip and dance along the edges of the law, but its pride and self-image would militate against being caught in a flagrant violation. There’s nothing debatable about the meaning of a nuclear test. None of this is a sure thing. What we do know is that absent U.S. ratification, none of it can happen. Washington and its allies cannot pressure others to do what the United States won’t. So, after 17 years of a voluntary, unilateral test ban, the United States bears most of the costs of the treaty without its benefits. The positive reason to ratify is that giving up nuclear tests enhances security. Since 1999, we have learned that a nonproliferation system designed against threats from states must be rebuilt to eliminate loopholes and to contain new threats from commercial groups and from terrorists. Iraq, Iran and North Korea exploited a critical vagueness in the NPT that must be fixed. In 2003, the news broke that a multinational, commercial network was selling bomb technology. On 9/11 Americans awoke to the terrorist threat, and we have since learned of some terrorists’ nuclear ambitions. But 20 years after the end of the Cold War, the non-nuclear states feel that the weapons states haven’t upheld their end of the NPT bargain: to move toward disarmament. They are, therefore, unwilling to discuss necessary new restrictions until they see movement. Ratifying the test ban is a necessary first step. So the second Senate debate on the test ban treaty pits an old way of thinking about nuclear war against today’s totally different threat. Countering proliferation requires military strength, which we have in abundance, and a willingness to connect the dots to political and diplomatic initiatives to which we have grown unaccustomed. What’s at stake is making the world safe for existing fissile material and for the nuclear energy that will be needed to deal with climate change, and keeping the world’s nuclear weapons states at nine.

WASHINGTON — Former PresidentBill Clintonwent toNorth Koreaon Monday to negotiate the release of two American television journalists who were sentenced to 12 years of hard labor for illegally entering North Korean territory, a person who was briefed on the mission said. Mr. Clinton landed in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, early Tuesday morning local time, Central TV, a North Korean station, reported. The White House declined to comment. The journalists,Laura Ling, 32, andEuna Lee, 36, weredetained by soldiers on March 17near the North Korean border with China. In June, they weresentenced to 12 yearsin a North Korean prison camp for “committing hostilities against the Korean nation and illegal entry.” The Obama administration had been considering for weeks whether to send a special envoy to North Korea. The choice of Mr. Clinton would mark his first public mission on behalf of the administration. His wife, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, has been deeply involved in the journalists’ case. The jailing of Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee came amid a period of heightened tension between North Korea and the United States after Pyongyang tested a nuclear device in May and then launched a number of ballistic missiles. The White House marshaled support at the United Nations for strict sanctions against the North Korean government, including a halt to all weapons sales and a crackdown on its financial ties. But the administration has tried to keep its diplomatic campaign separate from this case, which American officials have portrayed as a humanitarian issue, appealing to North Korea to return the women to their families. “Their detainment is not something that we’ve linked to other issues, and we hope the North Koreans don’t do that, either,”‘ the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said to reporters in June. At the time they were detained, Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee were on a reporting assignment fromCurrent TV, a San Francisco-based media company co-founded by Al Gore, the former vice president.

The council reached a compromise to chastise North Korea for launching a rocket while avoiding tough new punishments.
==::==

==::==
UNITED NATIONS— The major players on theUnited Nations Security Councilreached a compromise Saturday to chastiseNorth Koreaforlaunching a rocketwhile avoiding tough new punishments that Russia and China had feared would drive the North away from negotiations over dismantling its nuclear program. The Council may vote as soon as Monday on the American draft of a presidential statement, a step less forceful  than a resolution, that would tighten existing sanctions by singling out specific North Korean organizations and expanding the list of banned goods related to its nuclear and missile programs. After haggling all week, the five permanent members plus Japan agreed to the compromise in order to project unity, although the United States and Japan had initially pushed for a stronger response. Russia and China, in calling for a measured reaction, publicly avoided characterizing the rocket launching as a ballistic missile test, and the word missile never appears in the statement. But it condemns North Korea for the event and warns the country against any further launchings. “What the Council can do, and we hope will do, through the adoption of this statement is to send a very clear message to North Korea that what they have done under the guise of a satellite launch is in fact a violation of their obligations and indeed that there are consequences for such actions,” said Susan E. Rice, the American ambassador. Much of the world viewed the launching as an effort by North Korea to prove it is edging toward the capability to shoot a nuclear warhead on a longer-range missile. North Korea has said the rocket was designed to propel a satellite into space. A presidential statement must be passed by all 15 members of the Council. Although the United States considers it legally binding internationally, others deem it more of a recommendation. Given the weight of those backing it, passage is almost assured. But Libya, a Council member, expressed reservations Saturday since it maintains that launching a peaceful satellite is the right of all nations. American officials have said thesatellite fellinto the Pacific. The Council imposed sanctions against North Korea inResolution 1718in 2006, after the North conducted a nuclear test and a missile launching. But the major powers focused less on enforcing the sanctions than on negotiations with North Korea, called the six-party talks, to try to dismantle the country’s nuclear program. Those talks remain the major powers’ priority. The North had threatened to walk out of the talks if the United Nations punished it for the launching. But it has been silent on the subject recently, and analysts said Saturday that the Council response was measured enough that the North would likely continue to negotiate.

With the election of delegates to the Supreme People’s Assembly, North Korea laid the groundwork for a new five-year term for its leader, Kim Jong-il.
==::==

==::==
SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreaelected its rubber-stamp Parliament on Sunday in an election that outside observers monitored closely for signs of a shift in the isolated Communist government’s power structure. With the election of delegates to the Supreme People’s Assembly, North Korea laid the groundwork for a new five-year term for its leader,Kim Jong-il. The new Assembly’s first task when it convenes in the coming weeks will be to re-elect Mr. Kim as chairman of the National Defense Commission, an event that analysts in the region say the North will most likely celebrate by test-launching its longest-range missile, the Taepodong-2. At Mr. Kim’s behest, the new Parliament may also replace members of his cabinet and the National Defense Commission, the top ruling agency. North Korea watchers will scrutinize a new lineup for any sign that Mr. Kim is preparing to name a successor from among his three known sons, or is favoring a collective leadership of political and military advisers. Soldiers in uniform and civilians in fine dress, dancing and singing, lined up at polling places across the country, the North’s state-run media said. They voted under the portraits of Mr. Kim and slogans avowing loyalty to his leadership. In the previous election in 2003, the country reported a 99.9 percent voter turnout and total support for the single candidate running in each of the  687 constituencies, all hand-picked by Mr. Kim. This year’s voting is the first since Mr. Kim, 67, reportedly had a stroke last August. Elections scheduled for that month were postponed while he disappeared from the public eye. Although he has since re-emerged, his illness stirred up wild speculation in the region about whether Mr. Kim had decided to start grooming a son as the next leader for the dynastic and nuclear-armed nation. On Sunday, North Korean media cited an election day poem that urged North Koreans to rally around the “bloodline of Mount Paekdu,” a common reference to Mr. Kim’s family. Although such phraseology is part of North Korea’s usual propaganda, it assumed added significance, given recent unconfirmed news reports in South Korea that Mr. Kim’s youngest son, Kim Jong-un, 26, had been chosen to succeed his father and was running in Sunday’s election. North Korea was pushing ahead with the parliamentary elections as the American aircraft carrier John C. Stennis sailed to South Korean waters and thousands of American troops prepared to land for an annual joint exercise that begins Monday with the South’s army. North Korea says it sees the war game as preparation for an invasion. It warned last week that it could not guarantee the safety for South Korean passenger jets flying near its airspace during the military drill, causing several airlines to redirect their flights.

SEOUL — North Korea suggested on Monday that it will press ahead with test-launching what its neighbors believe is a ballistic missile capable of reaching as far as Alaska.

SEOUL —North Koreasuggested on Monday that it will press ahead with test-launching what its neighbors believe is a ballistic missile capable of reaching as far as Alaska. "One will come to know later what will be launched," the North’s state-run news agency, KCNA, said, commenting on recent news reports in the region that the isolated country has been readying its longest-range Taepodong-2 missile for a test launch from a base on its east coast. North Korea made the statement on the 67th birthday of the North Korean leader,Kim Jong Il, who is widely praised at home for spearheading the country’s "space development," a term the nation used when it tested a shorter-range Taepodong-1 missile in 1998. North Korea’s missile program has long unsettled neighbors because of the possibility that it might place nuclear warheads atop  them. Increased activities at the North’s Musudan-ri missile base --  where North Korean engineers have reportedly been putting together a 32-meter-long Taepodong-2 missile for a test  — came as U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was on her way to Asia to start her first overseas visit since taking office. Analysts and government officials in the region have speculated that North Korea is preparing a missile test  in the coming weeks to help make it a top foreign policy issue for U.S. President Barack Obama. With its economy in shambles and isolated from most of the world, North Korea has often used its military threats to extract economic aid and diplomatic benefits from other countries. On Friday, KCNA insisted that it had the right to pursue a "peaceful" space program and accused "hostile forces" in the region of spreading "the rumor" about a long-distance missile launch. Kim Jong Il, who was said to have suffered a stroke around last August, strives to live up to his main political promise to the country’s impoverished 22 million people: turning North Korea into a "strong and great nation" by 2012, a year widely seen as the time when Kim may designate his heir, possibly from among his three sons. Before her trip, Mrs. Clinton said that the United States was willing to normalize ties with North Korea and help rebuild its economy if it abandons its nuclear weapons.

SEOUL — The North Korean state-run news media on Sunday released  photos showing its leader,Kim Jong-il, smiling and looking vivacious, some two months after he was believed to have suffered a stroke. North Koreahas in recent weeks struggled to counter intense speculation from abroad about the state of its leader’s health, with methods that have tended to raise more questions about Mr. Kim’s medical condition. The state-run media reported that the latest photos were taken when Mr. Kim, 66, watched a match between two military-affiliated soccer teams but did not reveal when or where the game took place. But the trees in the background were yellow or brown, indicating that they were taken during autumn. Since Kim missed a parade on Sept. 9 marking the 60th anniversary of the North Korean government, officials in Pyongyang have done little to dispel speculation that he may have been at least partially paralyzed. The United States and South Korean officials believe that Mr. Kim may have suffered a stroke, probably around August. North Korea has disparaged such reports as a Western-backed conspiracy to sabotage its government and has insisted that Mr. Kim has no health problems. In two pictures released Sunday, Mr. Kim was smiling brightly. In one, he was talking to several officials, gesticulating with his right hand. In another, he was sitting in a chair in what appeared to be a special viewing box. In both pictures, he did not use his left hand. In one, it rested on his lap and in the other, his thumb was hooked into his coat pocket. Kim wore his trademark sunglasses and his usual full head of wavy hair, although South Korean officials said Mr. Kim has probably had brain surgery at least once. Since he failed to attend the Sept. 9 parade, speculation has persisted over what might happen to Asia’s only Communist dynasty and to the country’s nuclear arsenal if Mr. Kim were incapacitated. South Korean officials have said that he has recovered enough to maintain his grip on key state affairs. Last month, the North’s official news media made its first mention of Mr. Kim appearing in public since mid-August. But photos of him released at the time showed a verdant green background, prompting some experts to suspect that they may have been taken months before his reported illness. Speculation continued last week when Prime Minister Taro Aso of Japan said that intelligence indicated that Mr. Kim was probably in the hospital, though still in control. Last week, Mr. Kim also missed the funeral of one of the most senior members of the ruling Workers’ Party.

SEOUL, South Korea — An editorial inNorth Korea’s three major state-run newspapers urged the United States on Tuesday to abandon its “hostile” policies and proposed closer economic ties with South Korea, which will soon inaugurate a new president. But the message made no mention of the Dec. 31 deadline the country had missed to declare all its nuclear activities: weapons, facilities and fissile material. The New Year’s editorial is a customary vehicle for the country’s leader,Kim Jong-il, to set out his policy priorities. “An end should be put to the U.S. policy hostile toward North Korea,” it said, reiterating North Korea’s justification for building nuclear arms and detonating a nuclear device in  2006. “The source of war should be removed and lasting peace be ensured.”

As long as it has its plutonium, North Korea remains a threat.

ONE year ago tomorrow, North Korea conducted its first nuclear test, a small explosion that established it as the newest member of the world’s nuclear club. Strangely, since then, the prospects for peace and stability in northeastern Asia have never been better. North Korea’s agreement, last week, to disable all its nuclear facilities by year’s end is the biggest step so far in the right direction. The nuclear test seemed to give President Bush focus. He took control of his administration’s policy toward the North, ending a six-year feud between hard-line conservatives who favor the collapse of Kim Jong-il’s regime and others who favor negotiation. Eager for a foreign policy success before leaving office, Mr. Bush granted substantial negotiating power to Christopher R. Hill, the State Department’s point person on North Korea, and instructed him to reach a deal. By January, Mr. Hill had met in Berlin with his North Korean counterpart and worked out the broad outline of an accord under which the North would end its nuclear program in exchange for economic, energy and humanitarian aid and better relations with Washington. By February, talks in Beijing that included the United States, China, North and South Korea, Japan and Russia formalized the agreement. The North would shut down its nuclear program within 60 days and then, on a timeline to be determined, disable it. Almost immediately, the deal ran into trouble over the agreed-upon transfer of $25 million that had been frozen in  North Korean bank accounts in Macao. North Korea  wanted the funds transferred through a process that would in effect readmit it to the global banking system. The United States did not. The issue was creatively resolved in June through a web of international transfers, and the next month North Korea shut down its nuclear facilities, with the International Atomic Energy Agency watching. The speed of progress over the past year has surprised almost all North Korea watchers. Whether by necessity or desire, the North seems more genuine about wanting to improve its relations with the global community today than at any time since fighting in the Korean War ended in 1953. In addition to shutting down its nuclear program, North Korea agreed to last week’s  summit meeting between Kim Jong-il and South Korea’s  president, Roh Moo-hyun, during which they discussed further economic cooperation and the prospects of a peace treaty. Still, the nuclear accord is ambiguous on one issue that threatens to derail it: the question of what will happen to North Korea’s existing stockpile of fissile material. The country has reprocessed approximately 50 kilos of weapons-grade plutonium — enough for as many as 10 nuclear bombs — and this stockpile will soon be Mr. Kim’s last remaining card. Were he to give it up he would find himself seriously weakened and, quite possibly, at the mercy of those who seek to bring down his regime. Recently, however, South Korea’s foreign minister, Song Min-soon, has argued that the accord requires North Korea to ship the fissile material out of the country. To break the impasse, we propose that China, North Korea’s closest remaining ally, assume physical custody in North Korea of the fissile material. This would ensure that the North does not use it to make additional bombs, send it to another country for safekeeping or sell some of it to a terrorist organization for much-needed cash. While the International Atomic Energy Agency could serve as this watchdog, the North is unlikely to trust an agency that it believes to be controlled by the United States. Also, the North has already demonstrated that it has no qualms about breaking agreements with the agency; in 2002, Mr. Kim  expelled its inspectors  just before restarting his  nuclear program. China, on the other hand, offers some significant advantages. Kim Jong-il may tussle with Beijing’s leaders from time to time, but he knows they do not seek the collapse of his regime. And if the North fails to abide by its commitments, China could use its  huge fuel and food subsidies to bring added pressure to bear, which is something the International Atomic Energy Agency could not do. At some point down the road — after the North has become better integrated into the world community — the fissile material could be shipped out of North Korea. To be sure, allowing weapons-grade plutonium to remain in the country for any period of time is less than ideal. But no agreement that is practical will be ideal for all parties. Compromise is essential to the accord’s success. The goal of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula is closer today than it was a year ago. But there are still hurdles to clear. To ensure continued progress in ending the North’s nuclear threat, it is essential to acknowledge the elephant in the room and think creatively about how to deal with the fissile material.

The top American negotiator with North Korea said that the country agreed to account to international monitors for all of its nuclear programs.

The top American negotiator withNorth Koreasaid today that the country had agreed to disable its main nuclear fuel production facility by the end of the year and to account to international monitors for all of its nuclear programs, including what American intelligence agencies believe was a second, secret program purchased from Pakistan. At the end of a two-day meeting in Geneva — exactly the kind of one-on-one session that the Bush administration had refused to hold in recent years — Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, said that the two sides had agreed on what would be a speedy next step, following action by the North this summer to turn off its main nuclear reactor. “One thing that we agreed on is that the D.P.R.K. will provide a full declaration of all of their nuclear programs and will disable their nuclear programs by the end of this year, 2007,” Mr. Hill told reporters in Geneva, according to the Associated Press. He was using the initials for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the North’s formal name. But in a separate news conference, his counterpart, Kim Kye-gwan, who heads the North Korean negotiating team, made no mention of an end of the year deadline. He spoke instead of an accord to disable North Korea’s equipment and provide an accounting of its facilities, fuel and weapons in return for what he called “political and economic compensation.” If the North Koreans meet the schedule and disable their equipment, it would mark a major victory for the Bush Administration, at a time it is eager to claim progress on some diplomatic front to offset its problems in Iraq. Whether to offer the North rewards, including oil and, eventually, removal from the list of state sponsors of terrorism and diplomatic recognition, has been the subject of a six-year-long struggle within the Bush Administration. But most of the hawks who have opposed such offers are now gone, and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has given Mr. Hill far more latitude to strike a deal, and to meet the North Koreans outside of “six party talks” — the discussions have also included Russia, China, Japan and South Korea. Those talks are expected to resume in mid-September, and the weekend meeting was cast as a prelude to any agreement reached there. The hawks are still unhappy, and have suggested that Mr. Hill is giving away too much. “There is still simply no evidence that Pyongyang has made a decision to abandon its long-held strategic objective to have a credible nuclear-weapons capability,” John R. Bolton, the former American ambassador to the United Nations and, in the first term, the top State Department official on counter-proliferation, wrote in The Asian Wall Street Journal this weekend. “This inconvenient fact should make it impossible for the State Department to concede on other issues, even if it were inclined to do so. Creative minds are therefore working on ways to explain that any forthcoming North Korean declaration of its nuclear capabilities is ‘full and complete,’ thus eliminating the remaining troubling obstacles to full normalization of relations.” When the Bush administration came to office, North Korea was still appearing to abide by a nuclear freeze that it had negotiated in 1994 with the Clinton administration. But that deal fell apart after the Bush administration accused the North of cheating on the agreement, purchasing uranium enrichment equipment from Abdul Qadeer Khan’s nuclear network, based in Pakistan. While Mr. Khan and his associates have confirmed they made such sales, it is unclear what, if anything, the North did with the equipment. Mr. Hill said on Sunday that question would have to be answered as part of any full declaration. American intelligence agencies said earlier this year they are uncertain what progress the North made with that program, if any. The North Koreans conducted a nuclear test last October, though it was not entirely successful. It is unclear how many other nuclear devices they have produced, though intelligence agencies have estimated they may have the material for between eight and a dozen. The administration’s critics, including Mr. Bolton, have said it is almost impossible to imagine that the North would say how many weapons they have or where those weapons, or the fuel to manufacture new ones, are located. So far there is no agreement for an intrusive inspection system. Still, if the facilities at the Yongbyon nuclear plant are truly “disabled,” a term no one has yet defined, it would likely prevent the North from manufacturing new weapons and expanding its arsenal. Mr. Kim said on today that “we made it clear, we showed clear willingness to declare and dismantle all nuclear facilities.” Mr. Hill said that “we have to work out some of the details” on exactly what facilities will be disabled. “We will have a declaration in time to disable what needs to be disabled,” he said, adding that “for example the Yongbyon reactor would have to be included.”

To the Editor: Re “What Would a Diplomat Do?” (editorial, July 23): Finally, Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill is getting the recognition he deserves for the masterful diplomacy with which he has negotiated North Korea’s decision to shut down its plutonium-producing nuclear reactor. We are so used to tales of diplomacy ignored or even scorned that it comes almost as a shock that a skilled, persistent and patient diplomat can achieve great things for our country and the world. And yet, he speaks of his achievement humbly and cautiously, behavior unlike that of his superiors in Washington. Having led two medical missions to North Korea, I understand the difficulties Christopher Hill has faced there. It takes enormous patience to get anything useful done, let alone the shutdown of a nuclear materials production plant! Would that Chris Hill had been deployed to Iraq before this woeful administration blundered us into a tragic, debilitating, unnecessary war. Would that we had diplomats in the White House to match the excellence of Ambassador Hill. John O.

Arms negotiators failed to set a deadline for North Korea to disable its nuclear facilities following the shutdown of its reactor at Yongbyon, but top envoys planned to meet again in early September. Wu Dawei, a Chinese envoy, said working groups would meet before that to discuss technical details for the North&#8217;s next steps: declaring and disabling its nuclear programs. The United States had hoped the three days of talks would end with a deadline for North Korea to take those actions.

The provenance of the North Korean centrifuge program is a useful lesson in nuclear proliferation.

Aspen, Colo. THE six-party agreement signed with North Korea last month should certainly be applauded as a necessary first step in improving relations with the United States. While a good deal of the North Korean program is shrouded in mystery — just this week the United States again urged the North Koreans to disclose any uranium-enrichment activities — there are some things we do know, including the nature and status of the country’s reactors. North Korea’s one  functioning reactor, at Yongbyon, uses natural uranium for fuel and graphite as its moderator (the substance that slows the neutrons and enhances the fission reaction). These are the same ingredients used in the first reactor ever designed, which was tested by Enrico Fermi  at the University of Chicago in 1942. The best estimate is that Yongbyon has produced about 100 pounds of plutonium since it went into full operation in 1990. This is enough for six to eight nuclear bombs, depending on their design. (The North Koreans might have used about six kilograms in their Oct. 9 test.) The construction of the larger reactors North Korea was building was apparently  already suspended, for various technical reasons, before the agreement. The North Koreans have been fairly transparent about their reactor program but almost totally opaque about their program to make natural uranium suitable for nuclear weapons by using centrifuges. We know that there is such a program, but we do not know where it is  or how much, if any, uranium it has enriched. Centrifuges are much easier to hide than reactors. The provenance of the North Korean centrifuge program is a useful lesson in nuclear proliferation. One can trace it back to the spring of 1945, when the Russians were  overrunning Germany. Along with the army came a cadre of  atomic and nuclear physicists  who were looking for both German physicists and metallic uranium. The latter had been made in large quantities — tons — by the Auer company, a subsidiary of the Degussa chemical company, in part by using slave labor from the concentration camps. The Soviets were able to take home about 300 tons of processed uranium. Thanks to espionage, the Soviets  knew where to look and whom to look for.  (The United States had a similar program, called   Alsos,   that  competed  for many of the same people.) The Soviets collected a talented inventor of electronic devices named Manfred von Ardenne. He had made a great deal of money and had a large estate outside Berlin. On it he had a laboratory with a nuclear program financed by the German Post Office. In May  1945 the Soviets shipped Dr. von Ardenne east with some of his colleagues and equipment from his laboratory. By June he had set up a laboratory, Institute A,  in Sukhumi on the Black Sea in Georgia. Nearby, another laboratory,  Institute G,  had been set up by Gustav Hertz, a German physicist of Jewish ancestry who had shared the 1925 Nobel Prize in Physics. Dr. Hertz had been working out of sight at the Siemens company during the Nazi period. The Sukhumi scientists were ordered to find methods of separating uranium isotopes. Dr. Hertz chose to study gaseous diffusion. Uranium hexafluoride gas is forced through tiny pores in a membrane to separate out  the lighter isotope, uranium 235, which is needed for weapons. Dr. von Ardenne tried separation by using electromagnetic fields, a technique also  used in the American uranium separation program at Oak Ridge, Tenn. A third group, headed by a physicist named Max Steenbeck, investigated the centrifuge. Dr. Steenbeck, who had been arrested by the Soviets  and put in a concentration camp in Poland, had previously been in charge of research for the division of Siemens that dealt with aircraft. While in captivity he wrote a letter to the Soviet secret police, the N.K.V.D., explaining his scientific background; he also ended up in Sukhumi. Dr. Steenbeck began with a small group and some antiquated Soviet centrifuges that certainly could not have been used to separate uranium isotopes. In the summer of 1946 they were joined by an Austrian physicist named Gernot Zippe. Dr. Zippe had been in the Luftwaffe during the war and, after having been taken prisoner in the summer of 1946, he went from a prison camp to the relative luxury of Sukhumi, thanks to the initiative of Dr. von Ardenne. Neither Dr. Zippe nor Dr. Steenbeck had ever worked on centrifuges, but within two years they created the best centrifuge in the world — although at the time they did not know it. (To give some idea of its capacity, a typical laboratory centrifuge makes a few thousand rotations a minute. The Zippe centrifuge — this is the common name, although Dr. Zippe himself refers to it as the “Russian centrifuge” — can do 90,000 rotations a minute.) In 1956, Dr. Zippe was allowed to return to Germany. Although he was not permitted to take any documents with him, he was able to reconstruct his work, and began consulting for various companies interested in centrifuges, including Degussa. The private German companies, including the part of Degussa that was doing centrifuges, became nationalized in 1964. But in 1970 these national companies became part of an international consortium called Urenco. The Dutch had a branch in Almelo and, in 1972, a Pakistani metallurgist named Abdul Qadeer Khan joined it. Fluent in both Dutch and German, he was given the job of translating the German centrifuge plans into Dutch. He became familiar with both the German and Dutch versions of the Zippe centrifuge. In 1974, India successfully tested a nuclear device, and Pakistan’s president, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, put out a call to all the scientists in the Pakistani diaspora to return home and help make a bomb. Dr. Khan was one who answered and he brought with him the stolen plans for the Zippe centrifuge. This is not the place to go into the details of Dr. Khan’s activities, which in the end involved a variety of countries from Libya to China — to say nothing of Iran, whose centrifuges also have a Pakistani origin. By the 1990s Dr. Khan was exchanging weapons information with the North Koreans for similar information about their long-range rockets. We know he gave them plans for the centrifuge and probably sample centrifuges. We do not know whether he gave them plans for a nuclear weapon, as he had done for the Libyans. We also do not know to what extent the government of Pakistan was complicit in this. The army certainly was, and military aircraft were used to transport material. Pakistan has denied any involvement; Dr. Khan is under house arrest and no foreign intelligence representatives have been allowed to interview him. The North Koreans have reluctantly admitted that they have a centrifuge program but have not let any foreign observers see it. Such a program, if limited, would have been allowed by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. But the North Koreans would have had to declare it to the International Atomic Energy Agency, which then would have had the right to inspect it. This they did not do. Perhaps they enjoy the ambiguity. My own guess is that if they have an active program it is relatively small. And while so far the agreement we have made with them does not say anything about this program, clearly we must eventually insist on knowing its extent. The route that led from Soviet prisoners of war to the centrifuges in North Korea is so implausible that if one put it in a novel, no one would believe it.

Washington OF all the crises facing the new United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, the fraying nuclear nonproliferation system is arguably the most consequential. Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, has warned of 30 “virtual new weapons states” on the horizon. Obviously, the more countries that possess the bomb, the higher the risk of a nuclear accident, the theft of a weapon, sales of technology and hardware, and a serious miscalculation leading to nuclear war. So where should Mr. Ban start? With North Korea having declared after its test last October that it now possesses a nuclear deterrent, the understandable temptation will be to focus on Iran. This would be a mistake. North Korea is still some way off from having a reliable nuclear weapon, and to accept its having this capacity as a fait accompli would not only play into its game plan but also convince Iran and other countries that the international community lacks the will to prevent them from developing the bomb. A new approach is required. The logical place to look is to examine the lessons of “nuclear reversal” — that is, what has made states in the past give up the nuclear option. At first glance, the historical record doesn’t look encouraging: South Africa is the only country that has developed nuclear weapons and then destroyed them. Yet other nations have abandoned advanced research programs — including Australia, Argentina, Brazil, South Korea, Sweden and Taiwan — or, like Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine, given up the nuclear arsenals they inherited from the Soviet Union. One big reason for these countries’ decisions, not surprisingly, was the efforts of major powers to reassure them about their long-term security, so that nuclear weapons offered no appreciable benefit. How would this approach be applied to North Korea? The answer is not unilateral assurances from the United States. American officials have vowed many times that they harbor no hostile intent; repeating that mantra will not make it any more credible to Pyongyang. Similar guarantees from all five of the permanent members of the Security Council, however, could be more persuasive. Enter Mr. Ban. The diplomatic vehicle for such security assurances would be a United Nations-sponsored initiative to formally end the Korean War and dismantle the present armistice arrangements. As part of a peace treaty, the principal signatories — the United States, China and the two Koreas — would commit themselves to establishing normal diplomatic relations, recognizing the territorial integrity of both Koreas and, most important, ensuring a nuclear-free peninsula. To sweeten the deal, the Security Council’s permanent five would extend security guarantees, similar to those given Ukraine, to both Koreas. These would remain in effect as long as each side fulfilled its nonproliferation commitment. If one or the other reneged, all bets would be off. Complementary agreements involving conventional arms control, economic assistance, access to international financial institutions and humanitarian aid could also be discussed, but not as prerequisites for replacing the Korean armistice with a permanent peace settlement. The United States has already signaled its willingness to sign a peace treaty — but only after North Korea verifiably dismantled its nuclear weapons. Reversing the order, however, with upfront but still conditional security guarantees, would provide North Korea with immediate incentives to take the first step. For Mr. Ban, such an agreement would be not only a gift to his native Korea but a much-needed boost to his organization’s stature. Above all else, he might just save the nonproliferation system by using the same approach elsewhere, not least with Iran.

Senior American defense officials said that North Korea’s new facility confirmed longstanding suspicions that it was seeking a second route to build atomic weapons.

American defense officials said Sunday that the revelation of North Korea’s new uranium enrichment facility confirmed longstanding suspicions that the country was seeking a second route to build atomic weapons. They dismissed the North’s claim that it was simply trying to build nuclear power plants denied to them by the West. The description emerging of the new facility at Yongbyon, the North’s main nuclear plant, raised a number of critical questions that American and Asian intelligence agencies were struggling to answer. First is whether a foreign government aided the North in the rapid installation of what appeared to be 2,000 centrifuges, the machines that spin at high speeds to enrich uranium. Second is whether the North’s real purpose is to build a new, far more powerful class ofnuclear weapons, perhaps to bolster the credentials of the heir apparent, Kim Jong-un, the son and grandson of the only two leaders North Korea has ever known. Asked in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, where he was on an official visit, whether he believed the North’s story that it was producing only low-enriched uranium that could not be used in nuclear weapons, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates told reporters, “I don’t credit that at all.” He argued that the new facility, once it was operating, could enable North Korea to build “a number” of nuclear devices beyond the 8 to 12 they are now presumed to have. Adm.Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on ABC’s “This Week” that for a decade the United States had believed that the North wanted to “head in the direction of additional nuclear weapons,” and that the plant shown to Siegfried S. Hecker, a former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, was its chosen route. Administration officials, concerned they would be accused of an intelligence lapse, stressed that the United States had been tracking for a decade suspected efforts by the North to obtain the specialty equipment for centrifuges. They noted that President Obama, meeting in Seoul 10 days earlier with President Hu Jintao of China, had raised concerns about possible North Korean uranium enrichment. Stephen Bosworth, the administration’s special envoy for North Korea, said Monday after visiting with South Korea’s foreign minister in Seoul that the revelations about the new plant were disappointing but he did not portray them as a crisis or surprise. He said the United States had been analyzing the North’s “aspirations to produce enriched uranium for some time.” Admiral Mullen skirted a question about whether American intelligence agencies had known that a newly renovated building on the Yongbyon site had been renovated. But he said the discovery “validates a long-standing concern” about North Korea and its enrichment of uranium. David Albright and Paul Brannon, of the Institute for Science and International Security, wrote in an Internet posting on Sunday that it was possible that the North had “built another plant previously and either transferred it to Yongbyon or simply build another one based on its experience of bringing the first, perhaps smaller, one into operation.” It is also possible that the North got help from a country like Iran. The centrifuges appear similar in design to those used at Natanz, the Iranian nuclear fuel production site, but North Korea described them as higher-efficiency machines. The new plant’s modernistic technology, rich collection of centrifuges and up-to-date control room, which Dr. Hecker said were astonishing, did not exist in the spring of 2009, just before international weapons inspectors were evicted from the country. While North Korea has already tested two atomic bombs and produced other nuclear weapons, those were made from the spent fuel harvested from a nuclear reactor, not from enriched uranium. The United Nations already is punishing North Korea for flouting previous sanctions. The Obama administration’s new verbal campaign may be intended to pressure China, North Korea’s most important patron. However, Admiral Mullen did not express confidence that North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-il, would respond to new pressures, calling him “predictable in his unpredictability.”

Gymnastics officials are investigating a case of possible age falsification involving a North Korean gymnast who listed three  birth dates. North Korea and the gymnast, Hong Su Jong, will be given a chance to explain the discrepancies, the International Gymnastics Federation said. Hong’s birth date is March 9, 1989, on the entry list for the world championships this month in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. But she had a March 9, 1985, birth date at the 2004 Athens Olympics and the 2006 world championships, and a March 9, 1986, birth date at the 2007 world championships. If Hong was born in 1989, she would have been ineligible to compete in Athens.

Analysts said that the death of the official, Ri Je-gang, might help Kim Jong-il’s son, Kim Jong-un, replace elderly leaders loyal to his father with those of his choosing.

SEOUL, South Korea — A top North Korean official believed to be working to secure an eventual transfer of power fromKim Jong-il, the ailing North Korean leader, to one of his sons died last week, but analysts say they do not think it will impede the succession process. The analysts said that the death of the official, Ri Je-gang, coming soon after the death of another top official and the dismissal of yet another one, might instead help the son,Kim Jong-un,  replace elderly leaders loyal to his father with those of his choosing. The North’s state-controlled media announced that Mr. Ri, a first deputy director of the Workers Party’s influential Organization and Guidance Department, died in a car accident soon after midnight on Wednesday. He was 80. Mr. Ri’s influence came from his job of shuffling party and military officials on Kim Jong-il’s behalf. As always, when dealing with reclusiveNorth Korea, it is difficult for even longtime experts to divine exactly what is happening there, and the combination of the two recent deaths and the dismissal has fueled speculation that Mr. Ri might have been assassinated in a power struggle. But some analysts say the more plausible explanation is less nefarious: that Mr. Ri died while driving in possibly dangerous conditions. Kim Jong-il, a night owl and heavy drinker, likes to call in his confidants to late-night policy meetings and drinking parties, said Lee Sang-hyun, a North Korea analyst at Sejong Institute just outside Seoul. These officials judge their standing by whether they are invited to the night sessions, and if so, how often. “They get the order to attend in the middle of the night without a warning,” Mr. Lee said. By the time they set off to return home, they are often drunk, he added. Although top Korean officials generally retain drivers, Mr. Lee said the country’s leader often required officials to drive alone to the meetings to maintain secrecy. Speeding is also common in  the capital, Pyongyang, where there are few cars because most people cannot afford them.  But the streets are still dangerous, in part because of the country’s debilitating poverty. With the country suffering chronic shortages of electricity, street lights are dim and many tunnels have no lights at all, analysts said, and the roads are pocked with potholes. In 2003, Kim Yong-soon, Kim Jong-il’s trusted adviser on relations with South Korea, died in a car accident. Since 2001, Mr. Ri has been the No. 2 at the organization department, a party organ Kim Jong-il  used to consolidate his power in the 1970s and is still believed to be heading. Mr. Ri was also a close confident of Ko Young-hee, Kim Jong-un’s late mother, according to officials and analysts in Seoul. Ms. Ko died in 2004. “Kim Jong-unlost one of his two most important promoters, except his father,” said Cheong Seong-chang, another North Korea expert at Sejong Institute. The other is Jang Song-taek, Kim Jong-il’s brother-in-law and director of the administration department of the party. Mr. Jang is said to have been in a long-running rivalry with Mr. Ri. Mr. Jang’s influence has expanded in recent years as Kim Jong-il, who is believed to have suffered a stroke in 2008, has relied more heavily on close relatives, Mr. Cheong, the analyst, said. Yoo Ho-yeol, a North Korea expert at Korea University, said the rivalry raised questions about whether Mr. Ri’s death was truly an accident, but Mr. Cheong said that if it had been an assassination, “the North would not have announced his death as quickly as they did.” In any case, both of the experts agreed that Mr. Jang’s influence would rise further with Mr. Ri’s death. But they said that the death would not create any serious challenge to Kim Jong-un because his father had already rallied the country’s most influential political players behind his son. After the torpedo attack on a South Korean warship, which investigators from several countries recently said was carried out by North Korea,   some analysts speculated that the North had acted to increase Kim Jong-un’s chances at succeeding his father by building support for him within the military. The other top official to die recently was another first deputy director of the party’s organization department, Ri Yong-chol, 81, who the North reported had a  heart attack in April. And in May, Kim Il-chol, 80, a member of the supreme National Defense Commission, was dismissed from all his duties. The announcement cited his old age — a highly unusual move in the North, where the power lineup is filled with octogenarians. “These deaths and dismissals will give the son an opportunity to initiate a generational shift from octogenarians loyal to his father to a new lineup of officials in their 60s he is using to consolidate his own power,” Mr. Cheong said.

Analysts saw the move as shock therapy to fight inflation and curb the North’s mushrooming free market.
==::==

==::==
SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreahas taken confiscatory steps to curb unofficial economic activity and suppress inflation, issuing a revalued currency and sharply limiting the amount of old money people can exchange for new bills, South Korean news reports said Tuesday. The measures appeared to be a crude form of shock therapy intended to severely punish people involved in black market trading, which had begun to take root in North Korea in recent years as the country’s central planning system broke down. If carried out as described by South Korean and Chinese news agencies, the adjustment would wipe two zeroes off the value of North Korea’s currency, the won, and allow people to exchange only about 100,000 to 150,000 old won for the new notes. That would effectively decimate private stores of cash wealth in local currency. At the official exchange rate, 100,000 won is the equivalent of $690, and at the black market rate it is worth only  $35. Unconfirmed reports on South Korean news Web sites said that the revaluation and exchange limits briefly set off street protests in North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang, forcing the authorities to revise slightly upward the amount of currency people could exchange. The value ofthe dollarand the Chinese currency skyrocketed as people rushed to underground money-exchangers, said the Yonhap news agency of South Korea, citing anonymous North Korean traders in China. Rail stations were crammed with “uncontrollable crowds” of people rushing home to swap their money, said Daily NK, a Seoul-based Web site that specializes in gathering North Korean news, citing informants in Haesan, a North Korean town near China, and other cities. “It’s all chaos in markets and railway stations,” Daily NK quoted a North Korean as saying. But Good Neighbors, a Seoul-based Buddhist relief agency that collects information on North Korea through people inside the country, said that Pyongyang and other major cities had returned to “utter quietness” by late Tuesday as the North’s secret police, the national security agency and the military increased patrols, and most shop owners closed their stores. North Koreans were shocked by the currency reform, Good Neighbors said. Many had stored cash to help tide them over during the lean winter and spring months, but now they have suddenly seen  much of their savings wiped out, the group said. There was no official announcement of the measure in North Korea’s official media, and the accounts of protests in the North, which would be rare in the tightly policed country, could not be independently confirmed. “As people rushed to swap money, commercial activities have virtually come to a standstill,” Good Neighbors said in a statement. “The purpose of the reform is to kill private market activities that stoked anti-socialism.” South Korea has received intelligence about the reported currency move but has been unable to confirm it, said Chun Hae-sung, a government spokesman. Choi Soo-young, an expert on the North Korean economy at the government-financed Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, said: “The primary aim is to control inflation. But the North also wants to stop the market from prospering too fast.” Since a famine that killed many North Koreans and shook the rationing system in the mid-1990s, the North’s centrally planned economy, with state-run stores that sell goods at government-set prices, has coexisted with an unofficial economy where people sell homegrown food or goods smuggled in from China. For a time, those nascent signs of private-sector activity were cited as evidence that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, might be inclined to follow the example of China, the North’s neighbor and most important backer, which began to move away from its dysfunctional central planning system in the late 1970s. At that time, Beijing first allowed entrepreneurs to supplement the country’s state-run production and distribution systems. But after years of tolerating unofficial markets, North Korea declared in 2005 that it was reinforcing the ration system. Since then, it has restricted the kinds of goods that can be sold in the markets, how often they should open and the age of people who can sell there. Earlier this year, Vitit Muntarbhorn, the United Nations’ special representative on the human rights situation in North Korea, said that the government had singled out women in a crackdown on marketing activities. He said that by suppressing the private markets, the government was demonstrating its intention to keep North Koreans dependent on the state. Women have been especially active in the private markets, and there have been reports in the South Korean news media about young North Korean women protesting against the government’s renewal of antimarket measures while food shortages have persisted. In June, the authorities shut down the largest unofficial market for food and goods outside Pyongyang, dispersing traders to smaller markets in other districts, according to South Korean news reports at the time. One reason is that the mix of state and private activity has fueled inflation, partly by drawing goods that would otherwise be sold at low, state-subsidized prices into more lucrative private markets. “With the government stores unable to provide enough supplies, unofficial markets have fueled inflation,” said Dong Yong-sueng, an economist at the private Samsung Economic Research Institute who monitors the North Korean economy. Food priceshave risen so sharply in recent years that workers can buy only two kilograms of rice, about four and a half pounds, with their monthly wages, according to Open Radio for North Korea, a Seoul radio station and Web site that specializes in collecting news from informants in the North. The North Korean officials also saw the increasingly vibrant markets as a conduit of capitalist ideas and outside influence on the tightly controlled populace. By wiping out much of the wealth that traders have accumulated, the currency measure could anger many people who lose money. But from the government’s perspective it could have the effect of reducing a growing income gap among citizens, Mr. Choi said. The measure will have an immediate but short-lived impact in fighting inflation, Mr. Choi and Mr. Dong said. But it could also worsen the North’s already acute shortages by discouraging the markets, which have emerged as an important source of food for North Koreans. “As long as the North’s official economy cannot generate enough goods, and unless it can invite foreign investors by improving external relations, inflation will recur,” Mr. Dong said. “The vicious circle will continue.”

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreahas shut down its largest unofficial market in a sign that the Communist government was intent on quashing, or at least better controlling, market activities that it hadtolerated for years, Seoul-based organizations monitoring the country said last week. The market, on the outskirts of Pyongyang, was closed sometime in June and vendors were dispersed to two or three smaller  nearby markets, according to the Network for North Korean Democracy and Human Rights, or NKNet, which says it monitors the North using informants from inside the country. Such markets began opening in the 1990s when a multiyear famine loosened the government’s control on the  food supply. The closed market, called Pyongsong, had included an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 stalls where people sold everything from home-grown foods — cultivated outside collective farms — to goods smuggled from China. Some analysts say the North is cracking down on the markets because it fears the spread of capitalist ideas. But others say its move, against Pyongsong at least, might not be ideological. “Many members of the elite are making money off these markets, so I don’t think the government will try to completely shut down the markets,” said Kay Seok, a Seoul-based researcher for Human Rights Watch who has studied the North’s market activities. “Instead, they will try and figure out a way to control the markets as much as possible while making as much profit out of them as possible.” NKNet reported that the authorities had shut Pyongsong because vendors in the prosperous market did not donate to “urban beautification.” North Korea watchers have said the government is making a push to beautify cities before 2012, when the country’s leader, Kim Jong-il, is expected to say which of his three sons will succeed him. After years of allowing unofficial markets to operate, North Korea began placing restrictions on them in 2005, a campaign that defectors say has had limited success as people find ways around the rules. In January, for example, North Korea announced that informal markets should open only once every 10 days, and should sell only clothes and privately produced farm produce, according to the mass-circulation daily Chosun Ilbo of South Korea. Manufactured and imported goods should be sold only in state-run stores, the new directive said.

After former President Bill Clinton won the freedom of two American journalists, officials were busily calculating whether the psychology in Pyongyang had changed.

WASHINGTON — A day after former PresidentBill Clinton’s flight intoNorth Koreato win the freedom of two American journalists, the Obama administration moved Wednesday to send a stern message to the North Korean government: nothing has changed. WhilePresident Obamacelebratedthe emotional reunion of the journalists,Laura LingandEuna Lee, with their families, he said Mr. Clinton’s “humanitarian mission”did not ease the demands of the United Statesand many allies that North Korea alter its behavior if it wants to escape its isolation. But even as the administration took pains through its statements to assure allies abroad and voters at home that it would not be lured naïvely into yet another round of fruitless talks with the North Korean government, officials were busily calculating whether the psychology in the North had changed in a way that might create opportunities for resolving the long confrontation over its nuclear ambitions. They were also evaluating preliminary impressions brought back by Mr. Clinton and the other Americans on the trip about North Korea’s reclusive leader,Kim Jong-il, and any diplomatic signals Mr. Kim might have been trying to convey. Administration officials said the White House had no plans to change its strategy for negotiating with North Korea, which involves imposing strict sanctions on the government and inviting it back to multiparty negotiations only if it agrees to give up itsnuclear weaponsprogram. “We have said to the North Koreans that there’s a path to better relations,” Mr. Obama said in an interview with MSNBC. “We just want to make sure the government of North Korea is operating within the basic rules of the international community that they know is expected of them.” Mr. Obama’s message, repeated by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, illustrated the determination of the White House not to allow Mr. Kim to turn Mr. Clinton’s visit to his advantage in talks with the United States and other countries. Still, the events of the past two weeks show that relations between the United States and the North are, if nothing else, rich in diplomatic theater, with a new American administration working to find the right tone and strategy for dealing with a country that has confounded multiple presidents, including Mr. Clinton. Officials said the administration’s restatement of its policy did not mean that it was blind to the opportunities that could flow out of the mission’s happy outcome. “How this impacts the psychology of the North Koreans, no one can tell,” said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the issue. The White House began to debrief Mr. Clinton later on Wednesday, after he had short phone conversations with Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton, who is traveling in Africa. After delivering Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee to their families at an airport in Burbank, Calif., Mr. Clinton flew to his home in Chappaqua, N.Y. Among other issues, administration officials said, there is no established protocol for a face-to-face debriefing of a busy former president about intelligence and diplomatic matters. Do you summon him to the White House, or do you send a delegation to visit him? Mr. Clinton has not spoken publicly about the trip, which was cloaked in secrecy until just before he arrived in North Korea. He flew across the Pacific and back on a Boeing 737 that belongs to Steve Bing, a film producer and friend of the former president. Mr. Bing has been a major donor to Democratic candidates. For all the talk of the North’s isolation, the United States and North Korea hold regular back-channel talks through North Korea’s United Nations mission. The so-called New York connection laid the groundwork for Mr. Clinton’s visit and will probably play a part in what comes next. The release of the journalists could break an impasse between the United States and North Korea because, officials and outside experts said, there was virtually no prospect of reviving nuclear negotiations as long as the women appeared to be headed to a North Korean prison camp. At the same time, Mr. Kim  is likely to expect some kind of payback for the pardons, political analysts said. How the United States responds to Mr. Kim’s expectations may determine whether Mr. Clinton’s visit leads to a genuine opening between the countries. “They’re going to expect us to take our foot off the pedal,” said Victor Cha, who negotiated with North Korea in the Bush administration. “If China calls and says North Korea is willing to come back to six-party talks in Beijing if we relax the sanctions, this becomes a tough call.” In a sign of the administration’s sensitivity, a senior official said the United States had briefed officials at the highest levels of the Chinese and Russian governments last weekend about the nature of Mr. Clinton’s mission, to reassure them that the White House did not intend the visit to lead to bilateral talks with North Korea. One American official noted that Mr. Clinton, in his talks with Mr. Kim, broached the issue of Japanese and South Koreans abducted by North Korea — politically emotive matters for those countries, in their dealings with the North. Some of the administration’s calculations will be influenced by Mr. Clinton’s observations about Mr. Kim’s health and mood. He suffered a stroke last year, and his diminished health led to speculation that the North was caught up in a struggle to succeed him. American officials are also eagerly interviewing David Straub, a former director of the State Department’s Korea desk, who accompanied Mr. Clinton. Mr. Straub  speaks Korean and took part in back-channel communications with North Koreans when he was in the government. As the administration deliberates over North Korea, there are reports that the North is suspected of spreading its technology. The Sydney Morning Herald in Australia reported last week thatMyanmar was building a nuclear reactorand plutonium extraction plant, with help from North Korea. The acting State Department spokesman, Robert A. Wood, said Tuesday, “We’re obviously looking into these types of reports.” Mrs. Clinton said recently that there was concern about possible transfers of nuclear technology from North Korea to Myanmar.

SEOUL, South Korea — An image of the North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, shown recently on government-run television appears to be a doctored version of an earlier photo, raising the possibility that Mr. Kim’s health has deteriorated to the point where he has had to skip public appearances, a South Korean newspaper reported on Monday. On June 14, the state-run Central TV showed what it said was a still photo of Mr. Kim posing with a group of soldiers indoors during a visit to a military unit. The Chosun Ilbo, South Korea’s largest newspaper, said Tuesday that it looked remarkably similar to a photo the North Korean government had said was taken April 25. The newspaper quoted unidentified intelligence officials as saying that there was “a high possibility” the April image had been recycled. In both pictures published by Chosunon Monday, Mr. Kim stands with a group of soldiers under what looks like the same ceiling lights and the same Communist slogan. The later image, captured from television, is too blurry to make precise comparisons, but the heights and positioning of the soldiers in both images look strikingly similar, except for 13 figures who do not appear in the later picture. Officials at the National Intelligence Service, the main South Korean spy agency, said they could not confirm the report. South Korean analysts and media scrutinize nearly every image and statement from the North for clues about Mr. Kim’s health, a topic of intense interest since last September, when news reports surfaced that Mr. Kim, 67, had suffered a stroke in August. American and South Korean officials say that Mr. Kim appears to have designated his youngest son,Kim Jong-un, as his successor.

SEOUL, South Korea — Two American journalists who have been detained inNorth Koreafor two months on charges of illegal entry and “hostile acts” will be put on trial June 4, the Communist North announced on Thursday. The reporters, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, were arrested by the North Korean military on March 17 on the border between China and North Korea. They had been in China reporting on North Korean refugees forCurrent TV, a San Francisco-based media company founded by Al Gore, the former vice president. In announcing the trial date, the North’s state-run news agency, KCNA, gave no details on  what charges they faced. But the government had earlier said that it found evidence of illegal entry and unspecified hostile acts. The news agency  said that the country’s highest court, the Central Court, decided to try the case, indicating that the journalists will have no chance to appeal. The court usually hands down its verdict at the end of a one-day hearing. Under North Korea’s criminal code, a person convicted of hostile acts against the state faces at least five years in a labor camp. Illegal entry carries a sentence of up to three years. The trial comes amid heightened tension between North Korea and the United States after the North launched a long-range rocket on April 5. The United States pressed the United Nations Security Council to tighten sanctions on the North. In retaliation, Pyongyang expelled United Nations nuclear monitors, and threatened to restart a plant that makes weapons- grade plutonium and to conduct a nuclear test. News of the trial date came just days after Iran released an Iranian-American journalist sentenced to eight years in prison on charges of spying for the United States. The journalist, Roxana Saberi, was released Monday after an appeals court reduced her original sentence to a two-year suspended sentence.

North Korea also threatened another missile launch and nuclear test unless the United Nations lifts sanctions.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreasaid Wednesday that it would start a uranium enrichment program, declaring for the first time that it intended to pursue a second project unless the United Nations lifted sanctions. Calling theUnited Nations Security Council“a tool for the U.S. highhanded and arbitrary practices,” North Korea also threatened to conduct nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests. It would take North Korea months to prepare a nuclear or ballistic missile test, and some Western intelligence agencies suspect that it has already been pursuing a covert uranium-based nuclear program in parallel to its known plutonium-based program. New nuclear tests would use up some of North Korea’s fissile material, but give it more information to improve its technology, as would new missile tests. By making public threats, the North used a familiar tactic to raise the stakes in  its  standoff  with Washington. Analysts say the country needs outside aid to feed its own people and outside enemies to justify its harsh rule. Since the collapse of the Soviet bloc, when North Korea lost most of its trade partners and aid providers, the impoverished country has used threats as a survival tactic. (When the United States and South Korea provide the North with aid, the government internally tells its people that the “enemies come groveling with tributes.”) North Korea’s nuclear programremains its main, and perhaps only, attention-gathering tool and bargaining chip, and it has repeatedly wrested more aid from its threats, and even new bouts of engagement with Washington. The North’s first nuclear test in 2006 was considered something of a failure by the United States and South Korea. And a North Korean ballistic missile launched in 2006 blew up 40 seconds after blastoff and, contrary to North Korean claims, another rocket launched in early April failed to put a satellite into orbit, American officials said. On April 13, the Security Council issued aunanimous statementdenouncing the North’s rocket launching as a violation of a resolution after the North’s first nuclear test in 2006 that banned the country from nuclear and ballistic missile tests. The Council called for tightening sanctions, a move that the North on Wednesday said was tantamount to “a declaration of war.” A Foreign Ministry spokesman told the state-run news agency,KCNA, that the country would “take additional self-defensive measures” unless the Security Council apologized immediately, specifying “nuclear tests and test-firings of intercontinental ballistic missiles.” North Korea also “will make a decision to build a light-water reactor power plant and start the technological development for ensuring self-production of nuclear fuel as its first process without delay,” the spokesman said. Such fuel would be uranium-based. Engineers use the same fuel-making technology to produce highly enriched uranium for nuclear bombs. North Korea reportedly has told United States officials that it has extracted enough plutonium for several bombs by reprocessing spent nuclear fuel. But it has never confirmed that it has been pursuing a clandestine uranium-enrichment program that would provide an alternative means of bomb-making. On Wednesday, Fred Lash, a State Department spokesman, defended the Security Council’s action as “balanced and appropriate.” “We certainly call on North Korea, as we have in the past, to uphold its commitments” under two documents, he said: a Sept. 19, 2005, joint statement of six-party talks on North Korea, and a 2006Security Council resolutionimposing sanctions. “We remain committed to achieving the verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, hopefully through the six-party talks,” he said. “We urge them, as we always do, to return to the table.” The North insisted that its April launching, conducted after it ignored repeated offers of dialogue from Washington, was solely to put a communications satellite into orbit. But Washington maintained that the launching was a disguise for testing ballistic missile technology. Over the weekend, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Washington would not be “blackmailed” by the North. The United States and its allies will “tighten the band around North Korea,” she said. Washington’s approach appears to be based partly on a belief that the North’s recent moves were meant more for domestic purposes than to gain leverage internationally. Since his reported stroke in  August,  North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-il, seems to have shifted his priority to demonstrating leadership and securing a stable transfer of power to one of his three sons. And the best way to do so, experts say, is  to highlight the one achievement Mr. Kim can boast of: his nuclear and missile programs. Washington’s current stand on North Korea has raised some concern in Seoul. After recent policy discussions in Washington, Moon Chung-in, a North Korea expert at Yonsei University in Seoul, described the American attitude as “just like the first-term Bush administration.” Shin Nakyun, a South Korean lawmaker, who also attended the discussions, said: “Although they said they keep their door open for North Korea, I felt they were turning uniformly hard-line. They said there will be no carrots for the North.” The Bush administration reversed its refusal to engage the North after the North conducted its first nuclear test in 2006. Washington offered a string of concessions but was disappointed when North Korea did not acknowledge the suspected uranium-enrichment program or helping Syria on nuclear issues.

The moves, which came hours after the United Nations Security Council chastised North Korea, pose a nettlesome foreign policy test for the Obama administration.

WASHINGTON —North Korea, angered by aUnited Nationsrebuke of its recent missile launching, declared on Tuesday that it would permanently pull out of nuclear disarmament talks and restart its nuclear program. It also expelled United Nations inspectors from the country. The moves, which came hours after theUnited Nations Security Councilchastised North Korea for violating a United Nations resolution, pose a nettlesome foreign policy test for the Obama administration. Political analysts said they did not expect North Korea’s latest actions to immediately heighten the nuclear danger the country posed because it had dismantled parts of its nuclear plant at Yongbyon. North Korea has  taken a hard line before, only to soften its stance once it got  concessions or made a political point. Still, the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, said North Korea’s threat to abandon multiparty talks and reactivate its Yongbyon nuclear reactor represented a “serious step in the wrong direction.” He urged the North Korean government to return to the bargaining table. Privately,  administration officials said they expected little change in tone or tactics from North Korea until there was some resolution of an internal struggle to replace the country’s leader, Kim Jong-il, who only recently began appearing in public again after recuperating from what South Korean and Western intelligence officials have said was a stroke. “If you tried to do a grand bargain with these guys right now, it’s not clear that they would want to,” said Marcus Noland, an expert on North Korea at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “This is a situation in which no one can afford to look conciliatory to an adversary.” For now, at least, the administration’s strategy is to try to persuade China to exert its influence on the North to resume negotiations over its nuclear program, while trying to devise more targeted economic sanctions against the North. The Security Council decided unanimously on Monday to tighten sanctions against North Korea, and the White House has asked the United Nations sanctions committee to develop a list of North Korean companies to be singled out by April 24. The focus is expected to be on companies involved in missile and nuclear technology. Given the poor record of sanctions against North Korea, some analysts said they doubted that these measures would prove effective. They noted that China, which is by far North Korea’s largest trading partner, opposed a stronger United Nations response to the missile launching. Even by its strident standards, the North Korean government used particularly uncompromising language, saying the Security Council’s vote to condemn the launching and tighten sanctions was an “unbearable insult” to the North Korean people. “There is no need for the six-party talks anymore,” saida statementissued by the Foreign Ministry, referring to the off-again-on-again talks between North Korea and five countries, including the United States. “We will never again take part in such talks and will not be bound by any agreement reached at the talks.” The International Atomic Energy Agencysaid itsinspectors had been ordered to remove surveillance devices and other equipment at the Yongbyon nuclear plant, and to leave North Korea as soon as possible. Siegfried S. Hecker, a professor at Stanford University who has extensively toured the plant, said it would take six months to rebuild the cooling tower that North Korea blew up in June 2008 as part of an earlier agreement. But Dr. Hecker said the North Koreans could begin reprocessing plutonium from an existing cache in a couple of weeks. That would allow them to make at least one additional bomb, he said, which might embolden them to conduct another test and refine their bomb-making expertise. “With Yongbyon disabled, it meant no more bombs and no better bombs,” Dr. Hecker said. The North had earlier agreed in principle to give up its nuclear material and any weapons, but talks on how to reach that goal  stalled. During the Bush administration, North Korea is believed to have produced enough bomb-grade plutonium for six or morenuclear weapons. Dr. Hecker said that throwing out inspectors also raised the risk that North Korea could sell nuclear material to other countries. The United States has worked to get North Korea back to the negotiating table, even as it has tried unsuccessfully to win a tougher statement from the Security Council in response to the April 5 missile launching. The launching, experts said, was supported by the North Korean military and was part of a larger drama in which Mr. Kim was  reasserting his grip on the levers of power. North Korea had said the launching was meant to send a satellite into orbit, but Western analysts said it was a failure, with parts of the rocket plunging into the sea off Japan.  Nevertheless, it was worrisome because the North was using the same technology as an intercontinental ballistic missile. On Tuesday, China, which along with Russia had blocked a  sharper  rebuke from the United Nations, said it hoped that North Korea would reconsider. The Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said he was confident that the talks would resume, even if “emotions usually run high in such situations.” At the White House and the State Department, officials seemed to be digging in for a long struggle. “You have to be able to withstand short-term setbacks,” said one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter. “You can’t judge these things by short-term reactions.”

Before a long-planned arms control speech in Prague, President Obama is confronted with North Korea’s missile test, and links that country’s defiance with the need for nonproliferation.
==::==
2009-04-06T00:00:00Z
==::==
PRAGUE — Hours afterNorth Korea’s missile test,President Obamaon Sunday called for new United Nations sanctions and laid out a new approach to American nuclear disarmament policy — one intended to strengthen the United States and its allies in halting proliferation. “In a strange turn of history, the threat of global nuclear war has gone down, but the risk of a nuclear attack has gone up,” Mr. Obama told a huge crowd in the square outside of Prague Castle. “Black market trade in nuclear secrets and nuclear materials abound. The technology to build a bomb has spread.” And yet, he said, too few resources have been committed to developing a strategy to stop terrorist groups like Al Qaeda that are “determined to buy, build or steal” a bomb. Mr. Obama said that his administration would “reduce the role ofnuclear weapons” in its national security strategy, and would urge other countries to do the same. He pointed to the agreement he reached last week with President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia to begin negotiations on reducing warheads and stockpiles, and said the two countries would try to reach an agreement by the end of the year. He also promised to aggressively pursue American ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which in the past has faced strong opposition in Congress. It is a strategy based on the idea that if the United States shows it is willing to greatly shrink the size of its atomic arsenal, ban nuclear testing and cut off the worldwide production of bomb material, reluctant allies and partners around the world will  be more likely to rewrite nuclear treaties and enforce sanctions against North Korea and Iran. In his speech, he said North Korea’s missile test illustrated “the need for action, not just this afternoon at the U.N. Security Council, but in our determination to prevent the spread of these weapons.” “Rules must be binding,” he said. “Violations must be punished. Words must mean something.” Those words were added to the end of a long-planned arms control speech hours before, after the president was awakened at 4:30 a.m. by his press secretary, Robert Gibbs, with news of North Korea’s defiance. The president quickly began talks with senior officials, including Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, his former rival who offered up the now famous “It’s 3 a.m. and the telephone rings” campaign advertisement that was meant to show that Mr. Obama was not prepared to deal with an international crisis. Mrs. Clinton talked to South Korean, Russian, Chinese and Japanese officials, administration officials said. Mr. Obama, meanwhile, got on the phone with Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Gen. James E. Cartwright, the vice chairman. He also spoke by phone to Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and huddled with Gen. James L. Jones, his national security adviser, before heading to the square outside of Prague Castle to address the crowd there. Despite his calls for action, it remained unclear exactly what the West would be able to do to  punish North Korea. President George W. Bush pressed for similar sanctions after the North’s nuclear test in October 2006, but they had little long-term effect. At the United Nations Security Council on Sunday, members were at an impasse on whether to condemn the test. The United States and its main allies — Japan, France and Britain — were pushing for a resolution denouncing the launching as a violation of the 2006 sanctions, which demanded that North Korea suspend any activity related to the launching of ballistic missiles. As talks continued after a three-hour emergency session ended inconclusively, diplomats said a main issue would be determining if the failed launching violated any resolutions. “We think that what was launched is not the issue; the fact that there was a launch using ballistic missile technology is itself a clear violation,” said Susan E. Rice, the American ambassador. China left its position ambiguous, although diplomats said that at  the initial meeting it stressed that the North Koreans had a right like any other country to launch satellites. “Our position is that all countries concerned should show restraint and refrain from taking actions that might lead to increased tensions,” Yesui Zhang, the Chinese ambassador, told reporters. Igor N. Schcherbak, the Russian envoy, said that his country did not think it was a violation of the previous resolutions banning ballistic missiles, but he left some wriggle room by saying that Russia was studying the matter. In his speech, Mr. Obama said he still planned to continue with missile defense, but he tied the need for such a system to any Iranian acquisition of nuclear weapons. Russia opposes locating a defense shield in Poland and the Czech Republic, as current plans call for, and Mr. Obama has responded by pushing the Russians to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. Missile defense is a resonant issue in Prague, since the now-collapsed government of Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek went to bat against popular opinion here to support the missile shield, only to have the Obama administration begin backing away from the plan. But Mr. Obama praised the government’s support, saying there was still a need. “Let me be clear: Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile activity poses a real threat, not just to the United States, but to Iran’s neighbors and our allies,” Mr. Obama said. “The Czech Republic and Poland have been courageous in agreeing to host a defense against these missiles. As long as the threat from Iran persists, we will go forward with a missile defense system that is cost-effective and proven.” Despite his categorization of Iran and North Korea as threats, the new nuclear strategy as laid out in his speech sidestepped the question of exactly how to handle them, or the risk posed by Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal. Those cases have proved to be some of the hardest in modern nuclear strategy. And they prompt a question that has haunted past administrations: How do you compel a country to stop its drive for nuclear weapons when sanctions fail and military action seems far too risky? Past threats to isolate Iran were stymied first by high oil prices — which washed away the effects of modest economic sanctions — and then by Iran’s determination to enrich uranium no matter the cost. Mr. Obama has said  he will  try to engage Iran, but that has raised concerns both within the administration and among allies that the country’s nuclear program would be able to progress while talks proceeded. Perhaps trying not to overload a Pakistani government that has shown itself to be overwhelmed by daily political and terrorist attacks, Mr. Obama made only oblique mention of a concern voiced frequently inside the White House: That Al Qaeda and other terrorists view Pakistan’s arsenal of 60 to 100 weapons as the ultimate goal of a campaign to destabilize that government. On the North Korean issue, President Bush’s six-party talks, a process that Mr. Obama has embraced, set up a diplomatic framework. But they still failed to prevent the country from harvesting the fuel for six or eight weapons, testing one device, and advancing plans to test missiles. The diplomatic challenge was underscored again while North Korea was preparing its latest missile test. In London last week, Mr. Obama raised the imminent test with President Hu Jintao of China, whom the United States has relied on to influence the North. A senior administration official, briefing reporters, said he believed the Chinese had expressed concerns to the North, urging it to halt the flight. If so, Beijing was ignored — as it was twice in 2006, when it told the North not to conduct missile tests and then its nuclear test. That suggests, one of Mr. Obama’s aides said Sunday, “that either the Chinese aren’t trying very hard, or the North Koreans aren’t listening very well.”

Much of the world viewed the launching on Sunday as an effort by the North to prove that it is edging toward the capability to shoot a nuclear warhead on a longer-range missile.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreadefied the United States, China and a series of United Nations resolutions by launching a rocket on Sunday that the country said was designed to propel a satellite into space, but that much of the world viewed as an effort to prove it is edging toward the capability to shoot a nuclear warhead on a longer-range missile. North Korea launched the rocket at 11:30 a.m. local time, or 10:30 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time, said the office of the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak. Early reports from the Japanese prime minister’s office indicated that the three-stage rocket appeared to launch successfully, with the first stage falling into the Sea of Japan and the second stage into the Pacific. South Korea vowed a “stern and resolute” response to the North’s “reckless act.” South Korean officials, after studying the rocket’s trajectory, said it appeared to have been configured to thrust a satellite into orbit, as the North had claimed. No debris was reported to have fallen on Japanese land. There has been no confirmation of whether the third and final stage of the launching took place. But what may have mattered most to North Korea was simply demonstrating that it had the ability to launch a multistage rocket that could travel thousands of miles. The motivation for the test appeared as much political as technological: After acquiring the fuel for six or morenuclear weaponsduring the Bush administration, and negotiating a halt of its main nuclear reactor in return for aid, North Korea’s recent statements appear to be a bid for attention from the Obama administration. The Japanese government strongly protested the launching over its territory and asked for an emergency meeting of theUnited Nations Security Council. Lee Dong-kwan, a spokesman for the South Korean president, said, “North Korea’s launch of its long-range rocket poses a serious threat to the stability of the Korean Peninsula and the rest of the world at a time when the entire world is pulling its wisdom together to overcome the global economic crisis.” Over the years the North has sometimes conducted tests as a gambit to extract concessions for more aid and fuel and to demonstrate its nuclear capabilities. Manufacturing a nuclear warhead that is small enough, light enough and heat-resistant enough to be mounted atop a missile is far more complex than building a basic nuclear device — and intelligence officials and outside experts believe North Korea is still years from that accomplishment. Typically, it takes many years of experimentation for a nation to learn how to shrink an ungainly test device into a slim warhead. Nonetheless, the series of tests in recent years — in 2006 and 1998 — is prompting fears of North Korean proliferation among Japanese, Chinese and Western leaders. North Korea’s missiles have ranked among its few profitable exports — Iran, Syria and Pakistan have all been among its major customers. If this long-range test ends up a success, it would presumably make the design far more attractive on the international black market. The launching provides one of the first tests of Mr. Obama’s reaction to a provocation, on the weekend that he is scheduled to lay out for the first time, in a speech in Prague, his strategy to counter proliferation threats. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has ruled out any effort to shoot down the missile if the mission appeared to be a serious effort to launch a satellite. Rather, Mr. Obama’s top aides said during last week’s Group of 20 summit meeting in London  that if the missile were launched, they would seek additional sanctions against the country in the United Nations Security Council, perhaps as early as this weekend. President Bush pressed for similar sanctions after the North’s nuclear test in October 2006, but those sanctions had little long-term effect. “We have made very clear to the North Koreans that their missile launch is provocative,” Mr. Obama said Friday after meeting with President Nicolas Sarkozy of France in Strasbourg, France. Mr. Obama took the issue up on Wednesday in London with President Hu Jintao of China. While Washington has signaled calm, the Japanese response has been unusually strong. Japan deployed ships into the Sea of Japan and suggested it would try to shoot down any “debris” from the launching that threatened to hit the country. However, there is no evidence they tried to do so, and on Saturday, to the embarassment of the Japanese military, the country falsely reported twice that the missile had been launched. With the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, reportedly recovering from a stroke last summer, the missile test may also be an effort by him — or some in the military — to demonstrate that someone is firmly in control and that the country’s missile and nuclear programs are forging ahead. In recent times top American intelligence officials have told Congress they believe Mr. Kim is back in charge of the country, but they admit considerable mystery surrounds the question of whether he has regained all of his faculties. Stephen W. Bosworth, Mr. Obama’s special envoy on North Korea, told reporters that while the United States would seek to punish the North for the test, it was also prepared to resume six-nation talks with North Korea to persuade it to give up its nuclear weapons program. “We must deal with North Korea as we find it, not as we would like it to be,” Mr. Bosworth said. In addition to Japan, South Korea, which is in easy reach of North Korean missiles, deployed navy ships with missile tracking radar near North Korea. But President Lee, too, emphasized that the six-party talks should resume. North Korea tried and failed to loft satellites in 1998 and again in 2006. Western aerospace experts said the new North Korean rocket appeared to be fairly large — much bigger than the one Iran fired in February to launch a small satellite, and about the same size as China launched in 1970 in its space debut. David C. Wright, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a private group in Cambridge, Mass., said the North Korean rocket might be able to lift a small satellite of 220 pounds into an orbit some 250 miles high. If used as a ballistic missile, he added, the rocket might throw a warhead of 2,200 pounds to a distance of some 3,700 miles — far enough to hit parts of Alaska. Western analysts agree that North Korea’s missile launching is a military endeavor, despite its payload of an experimental communications satellite and its cocoon of North Korean propaganda. Starting with Sputnik in 1957, most of the world’s intercontinental ballistic missiles  began life as satellite launchers. Dennis C. Blair, the director of national intelligence, told reporters in March that “North Korea is attempting to demonstrate an ICBM capability through a space launch.” While many analysts have looked at the launching through a military lens, some say another perspective involves political rivalries on the Korean peninsula. For years, South Korea has been gearing up to fire a satellite into orbit and join the space club. Its spaceport of Oinarodo is nearly ready, but a launching scheduled for this month was delayed, giving North Korea an opening. “They’re racing to beat the South Koreans,” said Tim Brown, a senior fellow atGlobalSecurity.org, a private group in Alexandria, Va.

Punitive sanctions after the launch of a missile would most likely make no difference, because North Korea will return to negotiations in any case.

Busan, South Korea NOT so long ago, when we wanted to learn why hostile leaders were hostile, we studied their ideologies. Nowadays, having learned that ideology is either dead or an arbitrary system of signs, we analyze leaders by “putting ourselves in their shoes” — in other words, by assuming that everyone thinks the way we do. So it is that North Korea watchers who speak no Korean can confidently tell the rest of us what motivates Kim Jong-il. His country is poor, so he wants aid. We bombed his country flat in the Korean War, so he’s afraid of us. That missile launching Pyongyang has said it will carry out next week? Mr. Kim wants to get President Obama’s attention, so he can squeeze more money and security guarantees out of the next round of talks. If, however, we assume the perspective expressed in the North Koreans’ own official writings, things look very different. The first step is to regard not the devastation of the Korean War but the victories of the late 1960s as having defined the country’s relationship with Washington. That was when the North detained the crew of the American spy ship Pueblo for almost a year and shot down an American reconnaissance plane, killing all 31 people aboard. Every North Korean schoolchild knows that the United States did a lot of saber-rattling but ended up doing nothing. Over the past decade North Korea’s string of nuclear provocations has reinforced the public conviction that Washington’s bark is worse than its bite. Kim Jong-il has so far shown little indication that he does not share this conviction. As for economic matters, the leadership in the North has always considered them secondary to domestic security. If the masses lived well, fine, but Mr. Kim’s father, Kim Il-sung, once told the East German dictator Erich Honecker that they behaved better when they didn’t. In the mid-1990s, when Kim Jong-il was forced to choose between opening his country to the outside world and letting perhaps a million citizens starve to death, he did just what his father would have done. North Koreans now know that they are much poorer than their brethren in the South. They know this not just because the information cordon that once sealed off the country is in tatters, but also because the Kim Jong-il regime openly, even proudly, admits the gross economic disparity. The propaganda apparatus assures the masses that their heroic sacrifices are helping to nuclearize the North and keep America down. They are also told that the South Korean masses, for all their material comfort, are ashamed of being under the thumb of the Yankees and yearn to live under Kim Jong-il. This message worked well enough when left-wing South Korean administrations were paying tributary visits to Pyongyang, and making sure that their news media referred to Kim Jong-il as “the National Defense Council chairman.” But since he became president of South Korea last year, the conservative Lee Myung-bak has attached conditions to aid for the North and sharply criticized its nuclear program. The message to  the North Korean people is clear: their Dear Leader is not as feared and respected as they have been led to believe. This challenge has thrown the Kim regime into a crisis of which the outside world remains largely unaware. Thus, with the announcement of the imminent missile launching, the dictator is not trying to get Mr. Obama’s attention so much as his own people’s. It is not merely a question of carrying out the threats of the anti-Lee rhetoric, rich in allusions to a pending comeuppance, that have filled the party newspapers since last fall. The now-familiar cycle of North Korean provocation, American warnings, North Korean follow-through and American calls for more peace talks — calls that are always mocked as an abject surrender — must turn every few years if the “military first” regime is to justify its existence and give heroic meaning to the people’s hardship. Were the North to exchange its nuclear program for an aid package and an American Embassy it would quite literally become a poor man’s version of South Korea. Mr. Kim is realistic enough to know how long such a state would last. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has been wise to reject the idea of shooting down the Taepodong-2 missile. It is safer to allow Pyongyang another hollow victory than to humiliate it before the world. Punitive sanctions after the fact would most likely make no difference, because North Korea will return to negotiations in any case. But next time we go into talks, we must do so with an awareness of the domestic political realities that force the North Koreans to do the things they do. This means demanding changes where they matter most, and can be immediately verified — on the propaganda front — before putting our faith in some grandiose timetable of disarmament. If Kim Jong-il will not cease referring to himself as a “military first leader,” or stressing that America and North Korea “can never share the same sky,” we can be certain, without letting yet another deadline elapse, that he is negotiating in bad faith. For far too long, American diplomats have treated Kim Jong-il’s political culture as his business. It is ours as well.

In what appears to be its first message to the incoming Obama administration, North Korea has demanded that the U.S. normalize relations with it before it abandons nuclear weapons.

SEOUL, South Korea — In what appears to be its first official message to the incoming Obama administration,North Koreahas demanded that the United States normalize relations with it before the North abandons nuclear weapons. “It is a twisted logic to assert that the bilateral relations can be improved only when we show nukes before anything else,” the North Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “We will never do such a thing as showing our nuclear weapons first, even in 100 years, unless the U.S. hostile policy and nuclear threat to the North are fundamentally terminated.” The statement, distributed Tuesday night, came a week before President-electBarack Obamaformally takes office, and coincided with the Senate confirmation hearings for Hillary Rodham Clinton, Mr. Obama’s choice to be secretary of state. Mrs. Clinton indicated that the Obama administration would be more willing than the Bush administration was to engage directly with North Korea. During the past several years of six-nation talks, which  also included China, South Korea, Japan and Russia, the United States focused on dismantling the North’s nuclear weapons facilities and stopping the North from spreading nuclear technology to countries like Syria. As the talks stalled, however, critics said the American approach had failed because it did not address what they called the root ofNorth Korea’s nuclear weaponsdevelopment: a lingering hostility from the 1950-53 Korean War that keeps the United States and North Korea deeply mistrustful of each other. The war ended with a truce, not a peace treaty. The North Korean statement said Washington’s “hostile” policy had led to the North’s development of nuclear weapons. “We won’t need atomic weapons when U.S. nuclear threats are removed and the U.S. nuclear umbrella over South Korea is gone,” the North said. In Washington, a State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, said that “there is going to have to be a denuclearized Korean Peninsula” before the North could expect the United States to normalize diplomatic relations with North Korea.

North Korea refused to agree to a system of verifying its promise to end all nuclear activity.

WASHINGTON — A final push by President Bush to complete an agreement to dismantleNorth Korea’s nuclear weaponsprogram collapsed Thursday, leaving the confrontation with one of the world’s most isolated and intractable nations to the administration of President-elect Barack Obama. Four days of negotiations in Beijing ended in an impasse afterNorth Korearefused to agree to a system of verifying that it had ended all nuclear activity, which it had pledged to do. Among other things, the North Koreans have objected to allowing soil and air samples to be taken near nuclear facilities and sent overseas for testing. North Korea could still return to the bargaining table, as it has after previous rifts. Officials, however, indicated that any talks were unlikely to resume before Mr. Bush stepped down in less than six weeks, depriving him of the chance for the breakthrough that the White House had hoped to reach with the North Koreans in the sunset of his presidency. “What’s unfortunate is that the North Koreans had an opportunity here,” the White House press secretary, Dana M. Perino, said Thursday. “There was an open door, and all they had to do was walk through it.” The collapse of talks is reminiscent of a similar breakdown at the end of 2000, when President Clinton gave up on a plan to travel to North Korea in the waning days of his presidency as it became clear that a deal over eliminating North Korea’s medium-  and long-range missiles was out of reach. During Mr. Bush’s presidency, North Korea has tested its first nuclear weapon and has accumulated enough nuclear fuel to build eight more weapons, according to American estimates. The deal in which North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear weapons program was first struck in February 2007, but it has been fragile from the outset. Only two months ago, the administration officially removed North Korea from a list of state sponsors of terrorism in a bid to salvage the deal. Michael J. Green, a former National Security Council adviser under President Bush who is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said the administration had erred in removing North Korea from the list without extracting a more concrete step on verification. “The United States expended its carrots, including delisting North Korea from the terrorist list, in exchange for a verbal promise that Pyongyang would sign on to these verifications,” he said. “We now know the North Koreans tricked us.” A State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, said the administration would not restore North Korea to the list because the decision to remove it had been made “based on the law and the facts.” But at the White House, Ms. Perino suggested that the United States would reconsider some of the assistance it had provided under carefully calibrated agreements over the past two years. The aid includes fuel oil that the United States — along with China, Russia, South Korea and Japan, who are the other parties in the talks — had offered in exchange for North Korea’s steps toward dismantlement, but she emphasized that no decisions had been made yet. Even as the administration pushed to conclude a final deal, it had appeared that North Korea wanted to stall, perhaps to seek different terms from Mr. Obama’s administration. As a candidate and president-elect, Mr. Obama has pledged to take aggressive steps to halt nuclear proliferation by North Korea, criticizing Mr. Bush’s handling of the confrontation with North Korea as unnecessarily belligerent in the beginning and ad hoc later on. At the same time, Mr. Obama has not proposed a radically different approach to North Korea than the one Mr. Bush has pursued for the past two years. In a debate against Senator John McCain in September, Mr. Obama criticized Mr. Bush’s initial hostility toward North Korea, saying it resulted in that country’s decision to abandon the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and to test a nuclear weapon in 2006, but he also acknowledged the diplomatic effort that has since followed. “When we re-engaged — because, again, the Bush administration reversed course on this — then we have at least made some progress, although right now, because of the problems in North Korea, we are seeing it on shaky ground,” Mr. Obama said at the time. Mr. Obama’stransition officedeclined to comment on the latest breakdown in talks over the North Korean nuclear program. North Korea’s hard-line posture in recent talks has prompted some officials to question whether its reclusive leader,Kim Jong-il, was fully in charge after a stroke in August, creating a leadership vacuum that made North Korean negotiators unwilling to complete an agreement. A French doctor who treated him, François-Xavier Roux, confirmed inan interview with the French newspaper Le Figarothat Mr. Kim had a stroke but that his condition had since improved. Dr. Roux, a neurosurgeon based in Paris, told the newspaper that Mr. Kim had undergone treatment but not an operation; he last treated him in late October, he told the newspaper. Mr. Green, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said North Korea might be balking at vigorous verification measures because it was not forthcoming in its declaration of nuclear activities this summer. He said the uncertainty surrounding the country’s intentions posed an enormous challenge for the incoming administration. He advocated a “very carefully calibrated” balance between incentives and punitive actions, like halting fuel oil shipments. The latest breakdown in talks came after American and North Korean negotiators had reached what officials described as a verbal agreement on the conditions for inspections of the North’s nuclear facilities, including its main plutonium reactor at Yongbyon. The United States also wanted measures to verify North Korea’s proliferation and other nuclear activities. Administration officials said that the other nations in the talks had agreed on a written proposal, presented by the Chinese this week, but that North Korea continued to object to some of the verification measures. “Well, it’s the same old problem,” the American negotiator,Christopher R. Hill, said in Beijing, according to a State Department transcript. “The North Koreans don’t want to put into writing what they are willing to put into words.”

President Bush’s deal to remove North Korea from the terrorism blacklist is far from perfect. The next president will have to move it ahead.
==::==

==::==
We’re glad to see that the nuclear deal with North Korea is back on track. Presuming the latest agreement holds (always a big if with North Korea), President Bush can at least say that when he left office Pyongyang was no longer producing plutonium for nuclear bombs. President Bush finally removed North Korea from the terrorism blacklist after Pyongyang agreed to a compromise plan to let American and other inspectors verify that it is shutting down its weapons program. The deal is far from perfect. It includes vague and confidential terms that could cause problems. But it is not the surrender that hard-line critics are charging. In recent weeks, both sides have been playing a dangerous game of chicken. After North Korea shuttered its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, the White House balked at taking it off the terrorism list and insisted that Pyongyang also accept a go-anywhere-see-anything verification plan. The North  then barred inspectors from Yongbyon, threatened to resume plutonium production and appeared to be preparing for its second nuclear test. Instead of full access to any site with potential nuclear relevance, the compromise provides that inspectors can go to Yongbyon facilities and some academic institutions; access to other sites is by “mutual consent.” We would have preferred to see a more specific commitment for inspections at the site of North Korea’s 2006 nuclear test and hope Pyongyang’s pledge to let inspectors take samples from sites is as firm as administration officials say it is. We also know the cost of letting this deal fall apart. For six years, Vice President Dick Cheney and other hard-liners managed to block any serious talks with North Korea. In that time, North Korea’s scientists produced enough plutonium for at least four more weapons — in addition to the one or two already believed to be in its arsenal — and tested a nuclear weapon. There is no way that strategy can be considered a success. We still do not know if North Korea will ever abandon its nuclear weapons. The next president will have to demonstrate persistence, vigilance and flexibility to try to move this deal ahead. It now looks as if he’ll have a chance to try.

Christopher R. Hill extended his trip to Pyongyang in order to salvage a nuclear disarmament deal that the White House had hoped would be a major achievement.
==::==

==::==
WASHINGTON — The Bush administration’s top envoy forNorth Korea, Christopher R. Hill, extended his trip to Pyongyang on Wednesday as negotiators from both sides searched for a  way to salvage a nuclear disarmament deal that the White House had hoped to portray as a major achievement. The administration is desperate to restore an accord that has been teetering on the edge since last week, when North Korea broke the seals that United Nations inspectors had placed on its equipment and said it was restarting a facility to manufacture bomb-grade plutonium. State Department officials maintained that Mr. Hill would not offer substantive concessions but  had proposed changes in what one official described as the “choreography” of arrangements meant to verify the accord. Administration officials have acknowledged that the accord could collapse if the two sides do not reach an agreement this week. The Bush administration has already been fending off criticism from conservatives in Washington who argue that the United States should have extracted more concessions as part of the nuclear pact. North Korea was supposed to be dismantling its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon as part of the agreement, and any resumption of nuclear work at the complex would violate the terms of the agreement, which was announced with fanfare in June and was followed by North Korea’s public demolition of a cooling tower at Yongbyon. North Korea’s government has complained that the United States has not kept its part of the deal to remove the country from a list of state sponsors of terrorism,  and instead has made new demands. Those include requiring North Korea to accept a strict and intrusive verification system before the United States would carry out reciprocal steps. Mr. Hill is trying to find a work-around. One possibility, a senior administration official said, would be to rely more heavily on China, as close to an ally as North Korea has at this point, by giving it a more prominent role in verification efforts. Under one scenario, the official said, North Korea would submit a list of its nuclear sites to China, rather than to the United States; it would still have to permit inspections from American and Chinese officials. Mr. Hill will continue negotiations  on Thursday in Pyongyang, North Korea’s capital, administration officials said. The reported ill health of Kim Jong-il, the North’s leader, has also added uncertainty to the efforts. In Seoul, South Korea, on Tuesday, Mr. Hill told reporters that an agreement on verification did not mean that the North would be subject to immediate inspections. “The verification will actually take place later on, but we need to know what the rules of the road are for verification,” he said.

North Korea demolished a cooling tower that was the most prominent symbol of its plutonium production.

==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — In a gesture demonstrating its commitment to halt its nuclear weapons program,North Koreablew up the most prominent  symbol of its plutonium production Friday. The 60-foot cooling tower at the North’s main nuclear power plant collapsed in a heap of shattered concrete and twisted steel, filmed by international and regional television broadcasters invited to witness the event. The tower is a technically insignificant structure, relatively easy to rebuild. North Korea also has been disabling — but not destroying — more sensitive parts of the nuclear complex, such as the 5-megawatt reactor, a plant that makes its fuel and a laboratory that extracts plutonium from its spent fuel. Nonetheless, the destruction of the tower, the most visible element  of the nuclear complex at Yongbyon, 60 miles north of Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, affirmed   the incremental progress that has been made in American-led multilateral efforts to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons programs. “As you all saw, the cooling tower is no longer there,” Sung Kim, a senior State Department official who witnessed the blast  from a hill, told South Korean television.  “It’s a very significant disablement step.” But some experts in South Korea said the demolition, although dramatic, did not answer key questions, such as how many weapons North Korea  has built or whether it has exported its nuclear technology to countries like Syria. “It’s symbolic. But in real terms, whether demolishing or not a cooling tower that has already been disabled doesn’t make much difference,” said Lee Ji-sue, a North Korea expert at Seoul’s Myongji University. The demolition also shows that North Korea has concluded that the Yongbyon complex, in service for several decades, has served its purpose after producing an unknown number of nuclear weapons, Mr. Lee said. United States officials have accused North Korea of hiding an uranium-enrichment program, a charge that the North’s declaration on Thursday failed to address. On Thursday, North Korea submitted its first significant — although  partial — account of its arms programs. Almost simultaneously, President  Bush announced that Washington was removing North Korea from the  U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism, and issued a proclamation lifting some sanctions under the Trading with the Enemy Act. “We appraise this as a positive step,” a spokesman for the North Korean Foreign Ministry told the North’s state-run news agency on Friday night. But if Washington wants to see further progress in ending the North’s nuclear programs, he said, it must “completely and comprehensively abolish its hostile policy.” The spokesman added that South Korea should also be inspected and monitored to guarantee  the “denuclearization of the whole Korean Peninsula.” North Korea regularly accuses the United States of deploying nuclear weapons in the South. The Yongbyon complex, built around a Soviet-era nuclear reactor, is the North’s only known source of plutonium. North Korea had started disabling the reactor and other parts of the complex last year under an agreement with the United States, South Korea, Japan, Russia and China. Under the deal, North Korea has been receiving fuel aid from the five nations. But it was not obliged to destroy any of its nuclear facilities until further talks determine  what rewards it will get in return. South Korean and American officials welcomed the early demolition of the cooling tower as an encouraging sign of North Korea’s commitment to a broader deal under which Washington hopes to eradicate all the North’s nuclear assets. “By demolishing the tower, North Korea appears to demonstrate that it would not produce any more plutonium,” said Kim Yeon-chul, a North Korea expert at the Asiatic Research Center at Korea University in Seoul. The cooling tower carries waste heat from the reactor. While the Communist government kept its nuclear activities shrouded in secrecy, steam curling  from the tower into the atmosphere was captured in spy satellite photographs, providing outside observers with the most visible sign of operations at Yongbyon. The photographs reminded the rest of the world of the operation’s dangers. North Korea shocked the world in October 2006 by detonating a nuclear bomb in an underground test. It is also suspected by U.S. officials of  providing  nuclear technology to countries like Syria.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreadrove up tensions on the Korean Peninsula on Friday, test-firing  short-range missiles off its western coast, threatening to slow down its promised disabling of nuclear weapons facilities and accusing South Korea of sending warships across a disputed border, which it said could lead to naval clashes. South Korea played down the missile launchings, saying that they were part of routine military training. “We are closely monitoring the situation,” said South Korea’s presidential spokesman, Lee Dong-kwan. “We believe North Korea, too, does not want a strain in inter-Korean relations.” In Washington, a White House spokesman, Gordon D. Johndroe, said the missile launchings were “not constructive.” Experts here said the North was escalating tensions to improve its bargaining power in negotiations with Washington and with South Korea over economic cooperation. “By launching the missiles, North Korea wants to put pressure on South Korea and the United States,” said Baek Seung-joo, an analyst at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses in Seoul. The Yonhap news agency in South Korea quoted government sources as saying that North Korea had launched three to six missiles. Hours later, North Korea accused South Korea of moving 14 warships beyond the disputed border in the Yellow Sea on Wednesday, and warned of the possibility of naval clashes along the world’s most heavily armed frontier. Also on Friday, North Korea’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement blaming the United States for an impasse in six-nation talks on ending North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. The North said it would further slow its disabling of nuclear facilities if the United States continued to demand a fuller accounting of its nuclear activities.

YONGBYON,North Korea(AP) — The broadcaster APTN, the international television division of The Associated Press, was permitted on Friday to visit the North Korean nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, the heart of the North’s nuclear program. At the site, 60 miles north of Pyongyang, the capital, Yongbyon’s chief engineer reiterated the government’s position that it was disabling the reactor as promised in the disarmament-for-aid deal, but that it had slowed down its compliance because the other countries were not meeting their commitments. APTN showed North Korean workers in  protective suits removing spent nuclear fuel from the facility’s  reactor. The visit came as  talks have stalled over differences on whether the North has fully declared its nuclear programs under an October deal reached with the United States, China, Russia, Japan and South Korea. “It has been slowed down,” said the chief engineer, Yu Sun-chol. “Especially the discharge of fuel rods from the core has been slowed down.”

In rare remarks on the issue,North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-Il, indicated that he was ready to begin dismantling his country’s nuclear program, China’s official Xinhua news agency reported. “Recently some signs of easing on the Korean Peninsula have appeared,” Kim was quoted as saying in a meeting with China’s visiting foreign minister, Yang Jiechi. He said “all sides should implement the initial actions” of the accord reached in February between his country, the United States, Japan, South Korea, Russia and China under which the North pledged to scrap its nuclear program in exchange for energy aid and various diplomatic incentives. Mr. Yang arrived Monday amid hopes that Beijing would be able to get the reclusive Kim government to start honoring its commitments. United Nations nuclear inspectors and the American envoy to the six-party talks, Christopher R. Hill, visited Pyongyang, the capital,  last month, but they were not able to secure meetings with Mr. Kim.

The U.N.’s nuclear monitoring agency and North Korea have reached an agreement about how the agency will verify the shutdown of the country’s main nuclear reactor.

PYONGYANG,North Korea, June 29 (AP) — The United Nations’ nuclear monitoring agency and North Korea have reached an agreement about how the agency will monitor and verify the shutdown of the country’s main nuclear reactor, the agency’s deputy director said Friday. A team from theInternational Atomic Energy Agencyreturned Friday to the North Korean capital from a two-day trip to the Yongbyon nuclear complex, reported APTN, the international television division of The Associated Press. It was the first visit by agency personnel to the facility since United Nations monitors were expelled from the country in 2002. “We have concluded this understanding, what our monitoring and verification activities are in principle,” said Olli Heinonen, the agency’s deputy director, in footage shot by APTN. He did not provide specifics of the agreement. Mr. Heinonen said that his team, which had been invited by North Korea to discuss details of shutting down the reactor, was preparing to report to the agency’s board of governors within one week, but that the timing of the shutdown was up to the six countries, including North Korea,  involved in talks over its nuclear program. North Korea agreed in February to close the reactor in exchange for economic aid and political concessions, under an accord reached in talks with  the United States, China, Japan, Russia and South Korea. But North Korea ignored an April deadline to close the reactor because of a banking dispute with the United States, which was settled this week. On Monday, North Korea announced that it would move forward with the disarmament deal. The  initial phase calls for North Korea to shut the Yongbyon reactor and receive 50,000 tons of heavy fuel oil. Meanwhile, North Korea has test-fired three surface-to-surface missiles that landed in its territorial waters, the Yonhap news agency of South Korea and United States Defense Department officials reported. Yonhap said the tests were on Wednesday, but American officials said they took place Tuesday.

China and the United States are close to an accord to let North Korea regain some of the $25 million frozen in a bank in Macao.
==::==
2007-03-01T00:00:00Z
==::==
WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 — China and the United States are close to an accord to letNorth Korearegain some of the $25 million in its funds frozen in a bank in Macao now that it has agreed to start dismantling its nuclear arms program, American officials said Wednesday. The American officials said arrangements for North Korea to get a portion of the funds frozen at Banco Delta Asia, a small family-owned bank accused of money laundering, have been the subject of intense discussions this week in China. A deal could be announced in the next few weeks, they said. The issue of the funds, frozen a year and a half ago, was a major factor in the off-again-on-again six-party negotiations with North Korea over its nuclear program. North Korea angrily boycotted the talks for most of the last year, charging that the bank action was based on false charges and was an example of economic coercion. The intention to ease the freeze on the North Korean funds was not announced at the time of the North Korea accord reached on Feb. 13, but officials said at the time that they expected the issue to be resolved. Daniel Glaser, a deputy under secretary of the Treasury, has been in China this week for discussions about the subject. Mr. Glaser said this week that the United States had gone through more than 300,000 documents from Banco Delta Asia and consulted on them with both North Korea and China. The effort, American officials said, was meant to determine which of the North Korean funds were tainted by illegal activities and which were legitimate. “All of this work that we’ve done has put us in a position where we can begin to take steps to resolve the Banco Delta Asia matter,” Mr. Glaser told reporters in Hong Kong on Monday. He said the resolution of the matter would be completed “in a timely fashion” and “as quickly as possible.” The expected return of some of the frozen funds to North Korea — officials involved in the discussions say the sum could exceed $12 million — offers a striking case study of how the United States has used its financial laws to extend its reach to foreign banks and isolate a country from the international financial system. Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state who negotiated the nuclear deal with North Korea, said Wednesday that he had no doubt that freezing the funds compelled North Korea to negotiate. “I think they were concerned about the fact that we were able to go after an important note of their financing,” he said, testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. Hill added that the agreement on nuclear matters meant no easing of American concerns over North Korea’s illicit activities on drugs, weapons or counterfeiting. “I can assure you that we have not, and will not, trade progress on denuclearization by turning a blind eye to some of these other activities,” he said. The Bush administration hopes to replicate the North Korean experience with Iran, but American officials involved in the planning acknowledge that this might be more difficult because Iran has a web of banking relationships throughout Europe and the Middle East. Sanctions against Iran approved by the United Nations Security Council in December have contributed to Iran’s economic isolation, administration officials say. In addition, Treasury steps similar to those against Banco Delta Asia have forced Iranian banks to carry out transactions, including the sale of oil, in currencies other than the dollar. These steps have complicated business deals and the willingness of some foreign companies to invest in Iran, energy experts say. Recently, for example, Russia said it was slowing its investment in an Iranian civilian nuclear plant, saying that it objected to being paid in euros. Banco Delta Asia was seen in financial circles as an early test case of American efforts to use such sanctions against not only North Korea but also other countries charged with supporting terrorism or illegal weapons proliferation. In 2005, for example, the Bush administration labeled Banco Delta Asia a “primary money laundering concern” and charged that it was helping North Korea carry out counterfeiting, narcotics trafficking and other illicit activities. North Korea denied the accusations, and Banco Delta Asia, in filings with the Treasury Department, said it had no evidence of such activities for North Korea. Nevertheless, the bank and the Chinese government closed accounts of 20 North Korean banks, 11 North Korean trading companies, 9 North Korean citizens and 8 Macao-based companies that do business with North Korea, according to bank records. The bank also promised to cease any further business with North Korea or its business partners. American officials have suggested that some of these accounts helped North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-il, maintain a lavish lifestyle in Pyongyang, the capital. While the $25 million in Banco Delta Asia is believed to be a small part of North Korea’s financial activities with the outside world, it reflects only the amount of money in the bank at the time the funds were frozen. The volume of transactions conducted by the bank for North Korea could involve many times that amount of money, according to people close to the investigation into the bank. The main enforcement tool by the United States was an announcement that it was considering a step barring American banks from doing business in dollars with Banco Delta Asia, effectively threatening to shut it out of the international banking system. To protect themselves, American banks then stopped doing business with Banco Delta Asia. Those steps, in turn, forced the bank to shut itself down, hand itself over to the Chinese government and freeze all funds linked to North Korea.

SEOUL, South Korea — An evangelical activist from Arizona, imprisoned byNorth Korealast year after he illegally entered the country on Christmas Day, appeared Wednesday on South Korean television and spoke for the first time about his treatment by his captors. The activist, Robert Park, 29, a Korean-American who wasreleased in Februaryafter 43 days of detention, gave a harrowing account of his imprisonment, which he said included beatings, torture and sexual abuse. “The scars and wounds of the things that happened to me in North Korea are too intense,” Mr. Park said in an interview with the South Korean broadcaster KBS. “As a result of what happened to me in North Korea, I’ve thrown away any kind of personal desire. I will never, you know, be able to have a marriage or any kind of relationship.” Mr. Park said he attempted suicide soon after he returned to the United States. Hetold the magazine Christianity Todaythat he had been “in and out” of psychiatric hospitals for treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. He hadcrossed into North Koreaover the frozen Tumen River, which forms the border with China. He carried only a Bible and some letters urging the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, to close  prison labor camps in the North, free all its prisoners and resign. Analysts in Seoul said such personal affronts to Mr. Kim were  forbidden in the North and typically drew long prison terms or  death sentences. But Mr. Park told friends in Seoul before he left that he would die with political prisoners in the North if Mr. Kim refused to free them. Mr. Park read a confession on North Korean television, after which North Korean officials said they “decided to leniently forgive and release him, taking his admission and sincere repentance of his wrongdoings into consideration,” according to a report at the time by the North’s official news agency, K.C.N.A. But Mr. Park said Wednesday that the apology was a fake, and that the statement had been dictated to him. He said that he had a new appreciation for the harshness and cynicism of the North Korean government, which he vowed to devote  his life to fighting. “They have really thought about this,” he said. “How can we kill these people? How can we starve these people? How can we enslave these people? How can we control these people?” Robert R. King, President Obama’s envoy on North Korean human rights issues, has called North Korea “one of the worst places in terms of lack of human rights.”

The Obama administration is trying to choke off the flow of luxury goods for cronies of Kim Jong-il.

WASHINGTON — The latest target for the United States, as it tries to tighten the screws onNorth Korea, is a shadowy party organization, known as Office 39, which raises hard currency to buy fine liquor, exotic food and luxury cars for cronies of North Korea’s leader,Kim Jong-il. The Obama administration on Monday singled out Office 39 as one of several North Korean entities that it says are engaged in illicit activity — fleshing out new sanctions that werefirst announced in July by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clintonduring a visit to South Korea. Under a new executive order, the United States will try to choke off the flow of luxury goods into North Korea, which officials say Mr. Kim uses to buy the loyalty of the political elite, as well as the sale of conventional weapons by the North. The Treasury Department also designated entities suspected of trafficking in nuclear technology, using existing authority. “We need to send a signal to the North that provocative behavior will not go unpunished,” saidRobert J. Einhorn, the State Department’s special adviser on arms control and nonproliferation issues. “They are not directed at the people of North Korea, but at their leaders.” The administration finds itself at something ofa crossroads in its North Korea policy: determined to keep up the pressure on the North, while starting to question whether and when to engage the government. A wide range of outside experts have counseled Mrs. Clinton to restore some contact, contending that the sanctions have done little to change North Korea’s behavior and that the impasse is becoming increasingly dangerous. The administration’s moves came as Mr. Kim returned from amysterious visit to China last week, during which he met with President Hu Jintao. The North Korean leader passed up an opportunity to meet former President Jimmy Carter,who was in Pyongyang, the North’s capital, to win the release of a jailed American citizen. Mr. Kim’s decision puzzled administration officials and North Korea experts. Among the possible explanations, said one official: North Korea is now so economically and politically dependent on China that Mr. Kim felt that he could not afford to delay a planned visit to China. Then, too, Mr. Carter was not carrying any diplomatic message from the Obama administration, which may have made it easier for Mr. Kim to skip the meeting. In a letter to Congress on Monday,President Obamasaid the new sanctions were justified afterNorth Korea’s “unprovoked attack” in March on a South Korean warship, the Cheonan, which killed 46 sailors; as well as its nuclear and missile tests, and a variety of other illicit activities. Eager to demonstrate solidarity with South Korea, Mrs. Clinton previewed the measures during a visit to Seoul with Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, in which he announced joint American-South Korean military exercises. At the time, though, officials had few details. On Monday, the Treasury filled in the blanks, designating five entities and three individuals linked to weapons of mass destruction. Some of these entities, like the Korea Taesong Trading Company, have already been sanctioned, either by the State Department or the United Nations Security Council. Mr. Obama, in his new executive order, identified two entities and one individual suspected of involvement in conventional arms sales. The best known is the Reconnaissance General Bureau, an intelligence agency. The order also designates the commander of the agency, Gen. Kim Yong Chol. The focusing on Office 39 builds on longstanding efforts to deprive the North Korean elite of luxury goods. Sometimes known as Room 39, Office 39 is a branch of the Korean Workers’ Party that raises and manages a slush fund of hard currency for Mr. Kim’s family and friends. While some of Office 39’s dealings are believed to be legitimate — it exports exotic mushrooms, ginseng and seaweed, for example — the organization is suspected of being involved in the counterfeiting of American currency and drug trafficking. The Treasury Department said Office 39 had been involved in methamphetamine distribution and the production of heroin and opium. Office 39, which answers directly to Mr. Kim and has its headquarters not far from his villa, also procures luxury goods for the leadership. Last year, American officials said, the Italian government foiled its attempt to buy two Italian-made luxury yachts worth more than $15 million for Mr. Kim. Critics say that most of North Korea’s luxury goods flow through China, which is unenthusiastic about sanctions. Mr. Einhorn said that he would travel to Beijing soon to encourage the government to enforce the measures rigorously. Stuart A. Levey, the undersecretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence, said the designations of entities would have global impact because “there is already a real wariness” among foreign banks and companies about doing business with North Korean enterprises.

The North Korean regime’s propaganda now boldly promises that the North will attain the status of a “strong and prosperous country” by 2012.

NEVER mind the chronic food shortage: North Korea’s propaganda apparatus is partying like it’s 99 — and over there, it is. Year 1 of the Juche Calendar (named after “Juche Thought,” the regime’s official pseudo-ideology) was 1912, the birth year of the state’s founder, Kim Il-sung, whose birthday was celebrated last week. The new century will therefore be celebrated next year with all the requisite hoopla, which must then be outdone in 2012 for the 100th anniversary of Kim’s birth. The approach of back-to-back centennials, each symbolic of a national coming-of-age, puts great pressure on Kim’s successor and son, Kim Jong-il, to improve living conditions for the masses. So far, his response recalls the Soviet joke about Leonid Brezhnev “fixing” his stalled train by pulling the curtains and pretending it was moving. The North Korean regime, having been relatively cautious in its economic propaganda for decades, now boldly promises that the North will attain the status of a “strong and prosperous country” by 2012. The drastic transformation is said to be already under way, thanks largely to production increases effected by “C.N.C., ” or computerized numerical control. The English-language abbreviation, an incongruous sight in this most xenophobic of countries, now turns up in everything from wall posters to children’s songs. Below is my translation of a representative cross section of this new agitprop, taken from recent issues of the party daily, Rodong Sinmun, and some monthly magazines. It includes a song about “Juche iron” and vinalon, the national synthetic fiber, and a comic strip about a woman who manages to snag the bouquet for workplace innovations every time. A resident of an industrial town recalls the glory of a visit by the “Great General,” Kim Jong-il, while an article about friendly soldiers betrays the regime’s concern about worsening relations between civilians and the military. Remarkable even by North Korean standards is the current emphasis on kinship metaphors; in letters to the editor, people praise Kim Jong-il as a parent by blood, or describe the people in their “neighborhood unit” — in reality, a mutual-snitching association — as their “real” brothers and sisters. This being spring, the propaganda is not particularly angry; anti-American rhetoric tends to peak in June and July, when the start and finish of the Korean War are commemorated. How Grand Socialism Is! (Verse from a song in Rodong Sinmun, March 29; lyrics by Ryu Dong-ho) How grand, the vinalon fabric pours out like a waterfall How grand, the Juche iron glows like a fiery sunrise My socialist homeland overflows with joy Ooh it’s good, ah it’s good The day of living well draws nigh How grand socialism is! Quote Box (Youth Literature magazine, January 2010) “Without fail, we must throw open the great doors to a strong and prosperous country in 2012, the hundredth anniversary of the Great Leader’s birth, and the start of a new century in the Juche era of our glorious Kim Il-sung’s Korea.” —KIM JONG-IL A Place I Never Want to Leave (Rodong Sinmun, March 29) One February day last year, the Great General visited the town of Manpo, his face wreathed in joyous smiles. Factories, streets, houses — everything was clean and well ordered, and the convenience stores were well stacked with practical things. In a satisfied tone the Dear General warmly said that Manpo was well laid out, that the residents’ ideological morale was very good and that in terms of production, service, urban management and planning the town was a socialist paradise, a model for the entire country. Nothing could compare to the joy and deep emotion the local officials felt at being so generously praised ... The Dear General went on to say warmly that coming to Chagang Province, where things are going so well, makes him truly happy, relieving him of all his worries. Having arrived there, he said, he never wants to leave. Never wants to leave! How profound those words are. Profound words filled with the lofty idea that when all our workers and officials, like the people in Chagang Province, in Manpo, make their ideology, their aspirations, their fate as one with the leadership of the revolution, so their hearts burn with patriotic spirit, they too will be able to transform their home towns and workplaces into a socialist paradise — and build a strong and prosperous Juche nation in this, our homeland. Dispatch From a Worker-Correspondent (Rodong Sinmun, March 29) At Sinuiju Shoe Factory, Comrades Ri Jong-hee, Ri Song-gum and Ri Son-yong are well known for being good machine operators. Having been assigned to the stamping press after graduating from middle school, they harbor an extraordinary pride and confidence, relentlessly improving their technical skills and bringing about innovations in shoe production. Assuming a special responsibility for the maintenance of equipment, they managed to maximize utilization, thus making it possible for the factory to fulfill its one-year plan way ahead of schedule — a glorious feat. Our Strength (Poem from Children’s Literature magazine, March 2010) You Yankee bastards, look in surprise at the sky; Then come here with bent heads, looking into the ground You wonder what power fired the Kwangmyongsong missile And how, startling the world, We broke new ground in C.N.C. technology You can’t begin to know our military-first strength; It can’t be measured with your yardsticks. Crow Mimics Swan (Korean Woman magazine, February 2010) On an autumn day last year, when the leaves were falling, the U.S. Department of State put out a “Human Rights Report.” Nitpicking that this country’s human rights are like this, that country’s like that, it was a veritable laundry line, with enough items hanging off it to fill hundreds of sacks.... It’s funny all right, like a crow mimicking a swan. Because the whole world knows that the United States leads the way in human rights violations. To name just one instance: In May last year the United States bestially murdered 140 Afghans, including 95 children. Such calamities happen on a daily basis wherever America goes in the world. The United States is truly the devil of our times, amusing itself with murder. “America” is synonymous with “massacre.” For the world’s most serious violator of human rights to blather on about them is a mockery, an insult to human rights. ... It’s like the old story of the thief who cried “Thief!”: America’s moaning about human rights is a crafty trick aimed at covering up its own status as the world leader of human rights violations. But can a crow become a swan just by whitewashing itself? Soldiers Are Our True Children, Our True Brothers (Chollima magazine, February 2010) It was a November day last year at Comrade Jong Man-chol’s house, which nestled cozily at the foot of a mountain. Some familiar-looking soldiers had opened the front gate and were standing in the courtyard. “What’s this,” cried Man-chol’s mother, Yun Myong-wol, as she flew out to greet them. “You never said you were coming!” “When we were here a few days ago we noticed you having trouble getting the fire going,” said Comrade Soldier Kim Kwang-su with a smile. “So we’re here to fix the furnace.” “It’s nothing, we can do it ourselves,” she said. “You’re busy as it is, so get going!” “No problem at all.” Myong-wol tried vainly to push them away; in no time Comrade Officer Kim Song-min and the other soldiers were immersed in the repair of the furnace. Watching them with trusting eyes, she felt a surge of warm emotion: “What magnificent soldiers they are!” In that moment she saw before her, as if it were yesterday, all the officers and soldiers from the nearby unit who had looked after her family like blood brothers ever since her son returned with distinction from his own military service. Our soldiers, she thought: dropping by on birthdays, or on Korean War Victory Day, inspiring our son to keep the flower of revolution alive, taking care that our lives would be free from even the slightest inconvenience ... Later, having finished the furnace repair, the soldiers smilingly gave her a box of matches. “Mother, light the fire.” “As if I need to test it, when our sons have fixed it.” Our sons! Indeed! Our soldiers are our masses’ true brothers, true sons. —RI MYONG-SU Letter to the Editor (Rodong Sinmun, March 29, 2010) I am an old war veteran living in Pyokdong County. Thinking back on those days in the battlefield, when we cut down throngs of enemy bastards in a rain of fire, I still feel a youthful passion and ... the urge to jump into the maelstrom of life. That’s how I feel, all right — but how can someone so old help build a strong and prosperous country? Still, I am always in the warm care of the citizens in my neighborhood unit .... When I think of them, and how warmly they look after me, as if defying a care to cloud my face, the tears spring to my eyes even before I can thank them. Every day, every minute, experiencing our society as it really is, I want to boast to the world of my pride in being a member of this great family, with the General as my parent. —RI PYONG-JO, Pyokdong County, Neighborhood Unit 71

“Kimjongilia” is built around interviews with more than a half-dozen North Koreans who fled their country but can’t shake its hold on their imaginations.

Mystery, violence, appalling repression, colorful spectacle, a dictator in a jumpsuit — it’s no wonder North Korea has become an increasingly popular subject for documentary makers. In“Kimjongilia,”the director, N. C. Heikin, sets herself apart by adding a new element to the mix: interpretive dance. The film is built around interviews with more than a half-dozen North Koreans who fled their country but can’t shake its hold on their imaginations. Trapped in webs of anger and anguish, they tell their stories: a man escapes a prison camp because his friend hits the electric fence first and shorts it out; a successful singer is sold into sexual slavery in China; a woman’s entire family is imprisoned, and nearly all its members die in the camps, because she happens to know of a friend’s affair with Kim Jong-il, the North Korean strongman. These harrowing tales are reason enough to see the movie. But Ms. Heikin wants to provide a total experience, so she adds in propaganda films, her own animated presentation of Korean history and, most noticeably, a pair of female dancers — one in traditional Korean dress, the other in the uniform of a robotic North Korean traffic cop — who twirl, thrash and crawl in concert with the extreme emotions of the escapees. It’s as bad an idea as it sounds. The film is named after a hybrid begonia developed in honor of the Dear Leader’s birthday. But kimjongilia could also describe a psychological condition: a morbid obsession with Mr. Kim and the hellish country he oversees, shared by escaped North Koreans and Western filmmakers. KIMJONGILIA Opens on Friday  in Manhattan. Directed by N. C. Heikin; director of photography, Kyle Saylors; edited by Peterson Almeida and Mary Lampson; music by Michael Gordon; produced by Ms. Heikin, Robert Pepin, Young-sun Cho and David Novack; released by Lorber Films. At the Cinema Village, 22 East 12th Street, Greenwich Village. In English and Korean, with English subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 14 minutes. This film is not rated.

Pyongyang will never give up its nukes, but it makes sense for the U.S. to continue talks.
==::==
2009-11-17T00:00:00Z
==::==
President Obama is scheduled to arrive in Seoul on Wednesday for a summit meeting with President Lee Myung-bak. No doubt, North Korea’s nuclear weapons program will play a major role in the forthcoming negotiations. It is noteworthy that Stephen Bosworth, the U.S. envoy to North Korea, will fly to Pyongyang soon. So,  in all probability, the long-awaited direct talks between the United States and North Korea — the first official contacts since the second nuclear test in May — are going to start in the near future. This is good, especially since this time the Americans are coming to the  table with a more realistic understanding of the North’s strategies and goals. People in Washington have finally realized what should have been understood years ago: Under no circumstances is North Korea going to surrender its nuclear weapons. North Korean leaders believe that they need these weapons both as a deterrent and a diplomacy tool. Only through the existence of the nuclear program can North Korea, a destitute third-rate dictatorship, manipulate the outside world into providing generous aid. It is often suggested that Pyongyang might be lured into surrendering its nukes by a large lump-sum payment that could kick-start its economy (this is, essentially, the official strategy of the South Korean administration). Alas, a cash-for-nukes solution will not be acceptable to Pyongyang: The lump sum payment would be spent quickly, and without nuclear weapons, additional aid would be very moderate and would come with strict conditions about monitoring distribution. Such conditions are not acceptable, from the North Korean perspective, since the regime uses the foreign aid, above all, to reward the faithful and bribe those groups whose discontent might threaten its survival. Therefore, the only survival strategy is to keep manipulating neighboring powers in order to extract more aid, with the nuclear program being the major tool of this blackmail diplomacy. Under such circumstances it is clear that negotiations with North Korea have no chance to succeed if by “success” one means “complete, irreversible and verifiable elimination of North Korea’s nuclear weapons program,” once postulated by President George W. Bush as the supreme goal of U.S. policy. Such elimination is not going to happen as long as the current regime stays in power, and its collapse, while highly probable in the long run, is unlikely to occur in the near future. If de-nuclearization is impossible, does it make sense to negotiate with Pyongyang at all? It seems that the answer should be in the affirmative: There are useful goals that can be reached via such negotiations. First, it is possible to agree on dismantling the North Korean nuclear research and production facilities. North Koreans do not need their old labs, since their estimated 5 to 10 nuclear devices are sufficient for both military deterrence and diplomatic blackmail. If they produce 10 or 20 additional devices, their leverage will not increase, so they can sacrifice their research facilities if the Americans will agree to pay enough. This deal might be worthwhile, since it will decrease the probability of proliferation to third parties. Second, North Koreans will probably agree to some nonproliferation measures. Of course, they will charge as much as they can, but once again, if agreed measures seem to be efficient, this deal makes sense. Third, the negotiations will allow a channel of communication with Pyongyang to be kept open at a time when Kim Jong-il’s health is ailing and changes (not necessarily for the better) might happen at any time. Last but not least, the negotiations will create an environment in which North Korea’s exchanges with the outside world will become possible. As the experience of the Cold War has demonstrated, these exchanges lead to the spread of information, which in turn slowly undermines the power of the regime, whose legitimacy is largely based on false claims. In the long run, these exchanges will probably prove decisive, since they will contribute to the growth of the internal forces that alone can change North Korean state (and, among other things, bring about de-nuclearization). However, success is possible only if American negotiators will be persistent, patient and ready to bargain hard. They should also be prepared if the North Koreans, upon discovering that Americans are not rushing to shower them with cash this time, again use their favorite trick and stage yet another crisis in order to demand more money for restoring the status quo. If this happens, calm and polite indifference to North Korean histrionics is the best policy. Perhaps slow-going negotiations will decrease the likelihood of such an outbreak. In order to succeed, the U.S. negotiators also should be relieved from the political pressure to produce some immediate results that could be presented as a “breakthrough” to the American and international audience. We have seen many such fake breakthroughs in the past: It usually took a few years to see that these agreements were useless, or even harmful, but by that time new people were in charge in Washington, so Kim Jong-il could start the game anew. Let’s hope it will not happen again: The pace of negotiations should be slow, bargaining should be hard, and no magical breakthrough should be expected.

One of the two journalists held captive for months inNorth Koreaconceded to relatives after her release on Wednesday that she had “very briefly” crossed into the Communist country, her sister said Thursday. Lisa Ling, the television personality, revealed that her sister —Laura Ling, 32, a reporter with Current TV — planned to write an editorial explaining the events that led North Korean authorities to detain her and a fellow American journalist,Euna Lee, 36. But Ms. Ling, speaking by telephone on CNN Thursday evening, revealed that the two women did apparently cross into North Korea from China as they were researching a story on human trafficking on March 17. The women were subsequently convicted and sentenced to 12 years hard labor. “She did say that they touched North Korean territory very, very briefly,” Ms. Ling said of her sister, adding later, “She said that it was maybe 30 seconds, and everything just got sort of chaotic. It’s a very powerful story and she does want to share it.” Ms. Ling, a former co-host of The View, said that she would leave it to her sister to divulge  the remaining details for her captivity. The women’s return to the United States on Wednesday was set in motion by former president Bill Clinton, who traveled to the reclusive country earlier this week to negotiate their release with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, who granted them a pardon. But until Thursday, it was unclear whether the women had actually crossed the border into North Korea or had simply been captured  on the Chinese side. Either way, what followed were more than two months of harrowing confinement, Ms. Ling said on Thursday. She said that her sister had spent much of her time in isolation, with only three small meals a day that consisted primarily of rice with rocks mixed in, small vegetables, and fragments of fried fish “which she developed a reaction to.” Ms. Ling was confined to a small cell, where she would walk in circles for exercise, read books, and occasionally bathe. “Bathing was a little bit difficult because they didn’t have hot water,” Ms. Ling said, “So she would fill up buckets and she would say, ‘O.K., on Saturday I’m going to wash my hair.’” Among Ms. Ling’s only human contact, her sister said, was with the guards who were assigned to her cell. “I think she won a lot of her captors over,” Ms. Ling said. “She had some really lovely things to say about the people who were watching her. She had two guards in her room at all times. And even though they couldn’t speak together, they developed a sort of strange kinship.” In her short time home, Ms. Ling has been racked by a fear of being alone. On Wednesday, exhausted from her ordeal, Ms. Ling wanted to take a brief nap but pleaded for her sister to be there when she woke up, her sister said. She added that her sister’s colleague, Ms. Lee, has also been trying to adjust to her new life at home with her family. “I hear that Euna’s 4-year old daughter does not want her to leave her sight,” Ms. Ling said. “She keeps following her from room to room.”

A summit in Asia broke out into an acrimonious exchange between Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and North Korea.
==::==

==::==
PHUKET, Thailand — The United States andNorth Koreafell into an acrimonious exchange on Thursday, with the North Korean government ridiculing Secretary of StateHillary Rodham Clintonas a “schoolgirl” and a “pensioner,” two days after she compared its leaders to unruly children. At a meeting of Southeast Asian nations here, the war of words competed for attention with Mrs. Clinton’s campaign to marshal worldwide pressure on the North Koreans to dismantle theirnuclear weaponsprogram. On Thursday, the Foreign Ministry in North Korea issued a statement criticizing remarks Mrs. Clinton made this week to ABC News, in which she said the best response to North Korea’s behavior would be to ignore it, as one would a child clamoring for attention. “We cannot but regard Mrs. Clinton as a funny lady, as she likes to utter such rhetoric, unaware of the elementary etiquette in the international community,” the North Korean statement said. “Sometimes she looks like a primary schoolgirl and sometimes a pensioner going shopping.” North Korea said it would defend its sovereignty against the United States, which it accuses of aiming nuclear weapons at it. The ill will surfaced vividly during a meeting of theAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations, orAsean, at this Thai resort when the North Korean delegation turned up on a hotel podium to deliver a scheduled statement. The officials were told that Mrs. Clinton was due to speak soon, though she was running late, as she has often this week. After huddling, they stalked away and held a news conference nearby, at which they reiterated that North Korea would never return to multiparty talks with South Korea, Japan, Russia, China and the United States, talks that are aimed at curbing its nuclear ambitions. For her part,Mrs. Clinton said she was encouraged by the international supportfor putting pressure on North Korea. Even Myanmar, she said, responded to requests by China and other countries to track a North Korean freighter this month that American officials suspected was carrying illicit cargo. “The international community’s response to North Korea’s actions has been unequivocal and nearly unanimous, leading to a new consensus,” Mrs. Clinton said at a news conference, during which she read a lengthy statement restating the American policy on North Korea. She said there was a commitmentto carry out the sanctions called for in a United Nations Security Council resolutionadopted in June after North Korea’s recent arms tests. Among its measures, the resolution bans weapons shipments to North Korea and seeks to squeeze the sources of financing for its nuclear and missile programs. Mrs. Clinton singled out China, an influential neighbor, for asking officials in Myanmar, formerly Burma, to help in dealing with the North Korean freighter, which was steaming toward Myanmar. The vessel, the Kang Nam 1, eventually turned around on its own, and she called China’s pressure a “proximate cause.” She said she would discuss further steps in pressing North Korea with senior Chinese officials during consultations with China next week in Washington. Mrs. Clinton is leading the strategic and economic dialogue jointly with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. The United States has talked to China and other countries about a package of incentives, including economic and energy aid, which could be offered to North Korea in return for dismantling its nuclear program. But even before Thursday’s vitriolic statements from North Korea, American officials said they were more focused for now on inflicting pain on North Korea than on luring it back to the bargaining table. “We are not interested in half measures,” Mrs. Clinton said. “We have no desire to pursue protracted negotiations that will only lead us right back to where we have already been.” Mrs. Clinton said the North Koreans had been intransigent in their public statements during the conference. Other senior American officials said the tone of the North’s statements was openly hostile. Still, Mrs. Clinton may have contributed to the chilly atmosphere in her remarks just before the meeting. “Maybe it’s the mother in me,” she told ABC News, “the experience I’ve had with small children and teenagers and people who are demanding attention: don’t give it to them.”

White House officials are starting to wonder if North Korea’s leader has sent them on a fishing expedition as they track a ship with a history of arms shipments.
==::==
2009-07-01T00:00:00Z
==::==
Inside the White House, they are beginning to call it “The Cruise to Nowhere.” For more than two weeks now, White House officials have been receiving frequent updates on a rusting North Korean ship, the Kang Nam 1, as it makes its way dead-slow across the South China Sea. Earlier this month, Mr. Obama’s aides thought the aging hulk  —  with its long rap sheet for surreptitious deliveries of missiles and arms  —  would be the first test of a United Nations Security Council resolution giving countries the right to hail suspect shipments, and order them to a nearby port for inspection. But now some top officials in the Obama administration are beginning to wonder whetherKim Jong-il, the North Korean leader, ordered the Kang Nam 1 out on a fishing expedition  —  in hopes that a new American president will be his first catch. “The whole thing just doesn’t add up,” said one senior administration official who has been tracking the cargo ship’s lazy summer journey. “My worry is that we make a big demand about seeing the cargo, and then there’s a tense standoff, and when it’s all over we discover that old man Kim set us up to look like George Bush searching for nonexistent W.M.D.” Are the North Koreans really that wily? Maybe so. For a country that prides itself on its hermetic seal, it has played a pretty impressive game for the past eight years. As the United States headed for Iraq, it amassed the fuel for six or eight nuclear weapons. Mr. Kim set off a nuclear blast in 2006, then got the United States to take the North off the terrorism list in return for hobbling its main nuclear facility. Now it has set off another test and appears to be reactivating that facility, prompting Mr. Obama’s defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, to vow he would not “buy the same horse” a second time. With the world on high alert to intercept North Korean shipments  —  maybe a load of missiles like it sent to Yemen a few years back, or reactor parts like those that helped Syria start a secret program  —  imagine the headlines if the United States and its allies chased after a ship full of innocuous cargo. Inside the administration, officials ranging from Vice President Joe Biden to the deputy secretary of state, James Steinberg, have cautioned the administration to go slow. The Navy seems to need no convincing. It has kept the the U.S.S. John McCain  —  named for the senator’s father and grandfather  —  well beyond the horizon, so there is no sense of a low-speed chase at sea. Pentagon officials are clearly not eager to confront the Kang Nam 1. The intelligence about what is on board is typically murky. Some say they suspect small arms, which are banned by the United Nations resolution but hardly a major threat. Members of Mr. Obama’s team who served in the Clinton administration remember past embarrassments, including the interception of a Chinese ship suspected of carrying chemical precursors in the early 1990s. When the ship was finally cornered, the cargo turned out to be benign. Mr. Obama’s top aides say they are acutely aware of the dangers if the same happened with the Kang Nam 1. Whatever momentum the administration has created to confront the North Koreans would be lost if the first intercepted ship was carrying sea bass, or Ping-Pong balls. The Kang Nam 1 is hardly the only slow-burning confrontation withNorth Koreathese days, or even the most important. The country’s nuclear tests, while less than impressive, indicate that Mr. Kim’s engineers are getting better at nuclear detonations. They are learning from the many mistakes made during their missile tests, and they may have scheduled another one for coming days. (In 2006 the North set off missiles on July 4, and the nuclear test came onMemorial Day, showing a particular affection for American national holidays. Many expect the next missile test  —  one the North has suggested might be aimed at Hawaii  —  could come on Saturday. But if your holiday plans call for spending the day on Diamond Head, it is probably not worth cancelling your plans: There is no evidence yet the North’s missiles can reach that far, and their aim is singularly unimpressive.) But the Kang Nam 1 is a test of whether United Nations sanctions have some teeth. And in a bigger sense the caution about intercepting the ship reflects a bigger concern about going about sanctions in the right way  —  a way that keeps the allies and other nations on board. Mr. Obama is eager to demonstrate, his aides say, that he is not Mr. Bush and will not stretch the authorities granted by the Security Council. So American officials say they have no intention of boarding the Kang Nam 1 or any other North Korean-flagged ship  on the high seas, a step the North has warned it would consider an act of war. They have been telling members of Congress that this is not the Cuban Missile Crisis  — it is an effort to bring the Chinese and the Russians aboard for gradually escalating sanctions. The country watching all this most closely, officials say they assume, is Iran. When the headlines about the election and potential vote fraud in Iran begin to fade, its nuclear facilities could be the next targets of a United Nations-sanctioned inspection regime. The Iranians have, in the past, ranked among North Korea’s biggest customers for missile parts, some shipped directly from North Korea. Now that there is renewed talk of sanctions aimed at Tehran  —  a likely subject of conversation at the meeting of leaders of the largest industrial nations in Italy next week  —  the outcome of the world’s most lethargic race at sea may appear as important in the Strait of Hormuz as it does in the South China Sea.

The new effort to intercept North Korean ships, and track them to their next port if they refuse inspection, is part of what officials described as “vigorous enforcement.”

WASHINGTON — The Obama administration will order the Navy to hail and request permission to inspect North Korean ships at sea suspected of carrying arms or nuclear technology, but will not board them by force, senior administration officials said Monday. The new effort to intercept North Korean ships, and track them to their next port, where Washington will press for the inspections they refused at sea, is part of what the officials described as “vigorous enforcement” of the United Nations Security Council resolution approved Friday. The planned American action stops just short of the forced inspections thatNorth Koreahas said that it would regard as an act of war. Still, the administration’s plans, if fully executed, would amount to the most confrontational approach taken by the United States in dealing with North Korea in years, and carries a risk of escalating tensions at a time when North Korea has been carrying out missile and nuclear tests. In discussingPresident Obama’s strategy on Monday, administration officials said that the United States would report any ship that refused inspection to the Security Council. While the Navy and American intelligence agencies continued to track the ship, the administration would mount a vigorous diplomatic effort to insist that the inspections be carried out by any country that allowed the vessel into port. The officials said that they believed that China would also enforce the new sanctions, which also require countries to refuse to refuel or resupply ships suspected of carrying out arms and nuclear technology. While China has said little in public about how it plans to deal with North Korea, once a close cold war ally, one official said the administration was told by their Chinese counterparts that China “would not have signed on to this resolution unless they intended to enforce it.” The strategy of ordering ships to stop but not provoking military action by boarding them was negotiated among Washington, Beijing and Moscow. It is unclear to what degree South Korea or Japan, at various times bitter adversaries of North Korea, would order their naval forces to join in the effort to intercept suspected shipments at sea, largely because of fears about what would happen if North Korean ships opened fire. A senior administration official said Monday evening that the United States believed that it already had sufficient intelligence and naval assets in the Sea of Japan to track North Korean ships and flights. The country’s cargo fleet is relatively small, and the North is wary, officials say, of entrusting shipments banned by the United Nations to Panamanian-flagged freighters or those from other countries. Until now, American interceptions of North Korean ships have been rare. Early in the Bush administration,a shipment of missiles to Yemen was discovered, but the United States permitted the shipment to go through after the Yemenis said they had paid for the missiles and expected delivery. Under the new United Nations resolution, American officials said they now had the authority to seize such shipments. The senior administration officials outlined Mr. Obama’s approach a day before the president was to meet for the first time on Tuesday with South Korea’s president, Lee Myung-bak, a conservative who has been far more confrontational in his dealings with North Korea than most of his predecessors. The resolution authorizes nations to seek to stop suspect North Korean shipments on the high seas, but they do not authorize forcible boarding or inspections. “The captains will be confronted,” one official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was discussing a security operation that America’s key allies had only been partially briefed on. Even if they refused to allow inspections, the official said, “These guys aren’t going to get very far.” While the captain of a ship may refuse inspection, as the North Koreans almost certainly would, the Obama administration officials noted that most North Korean vessels have limited range and would have to seek out ports in search of fuel and supplies. American officials believe that previous North Korean shipments of nuclear technology and missiles have gone undetected. The North Koreans were deeply involved in the construction of a reactor in Syria until September 2007, when the reactor was destroyed in an Israeli air raid. But no ships or aircraft carrying parts for that reactor were ever found. Mr. Obama’s decisions about North Korea stem from a fundamentally different assessment of the North’s intentions than that of previous administrations. Nearly 16 years of on-and-off negotiations — punctuated by major crises in 1994 and 2003 — were based on an assumption that ultimately, the North was willing to give up its nuclear capability. A review, carried out by the Obama administration during its first month in office, concluded that North Korea had no intention of trading away what it calls its “nuclear deterrent” in return for food, fuel and security guarantees. Mr. Obama’s aides have said that while the new president is willing to re-engage in either the talks with North Korea and its neighbors, or in direct bilateral discussions, he will not agree to an incremental dismantlement of the North’s nuclear facilities. “There are ways to do this that are truly irreversible,” said one of Mr. Obama’s aides, declining to be specific. North Korea is already working to reverse the dismantlement of some of its facilities negotiated in Mr. Bush’s last days in office. In the weeks ahead of and after its second nuclear test, conducted May 25, North Korea has disavowed its past commitments to give up those weapons, and said it would never bow to the demands of the United States, its allies, or the United Nations. On Saturday the North said that it would reprocess its remaining stockpile of spent nuclear fuel into plutonium, adding to an existing stockpile believed sufficient to make six or eight weapons. Such announcements have heightened fears that North Korea’s next step could be to sell more of its nuclear or missile technology, one of the few profitable exports of a broken, starving country. The result is that Mr. Obama, in his first year in office, is putting into effect many of the harshest steps against North Korea that were advocated by conservatives in the Bush White House, including Vice President Dick Cheney. The new approach, officials said, will also exploit elements of the Security Council resolution to try to close down the subsidiaries of North Korean missile makers in China, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East, where the North has its biggest customers.

Intelligence officials are struggling to compile a dossier on Kim Jong-un, thought to be in line to succeed his father.
==::==
2009-06-15T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — There is only one photograph available outsideNorth Koreathought to be that of the man South Korean officials believe will inherit the world’s most unpredictable regime, one that is armed with nuclear weapons. In that picture, the man,Kim Jong-un, a son of the ailing North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, is an 11-year-old. “When Prince Jong-un shook hands with me, he fixed me with a vicious look,” Kim Jong-il’s former Japanese sushi chef wrote in a 2003 memoir describing his first encounter with the boy, then 7, dressed in a military uniform and known as a “prince” among his father’s aides. “I still cannot forget the look in his eyes. It seemed to say, ‘This is a despicable Japanese.’ ” The chef, who goes by the pen name Kenji Fujimoto, said in an interview that as a teenager, Kim Jong-un was already his father’s favorite and “looked just like him.” The lone photo and Mr. Fujimoto’s memories form part of the few precious strands of information analysts and intelligence officials in South Korea and Washington rely on as they struggle to put together a dossier on Kim Jong-un, the youngest and least-known of Kim Jong-il’s three sons. They describe Kim Jong-un as a man in his mid-20s, of medium height, overweight and prone to high blood pressure and suffering from diabetes, and with character traits similar to his father’s. “We picture a charismatic young man, authoritarian, politically astute and precocious and ambitious,” said Cheong Seong-chang, a researcher at the Sejong Institute, near Seoul. “We picture Little Kim Jong-il.” The question of who will succeed Kim Jong-il has  grown in importance since he was reported to have suffered a stroke in August. Last week, South Korean news reports, lawmakers and analysts who have access to intelligence assessments said that Mr. Kim, 67, had decided to hand over the reins to Kim Jong-un while North Korean generals, ruling party officials and diplomats abroad were all pledging fealty to the son. But the walls of secrecy that surround North Korean leaders make the guessing about who is in and who is out in the succession game notoriously difficult.  Indeed, the dearth of information about Kim Jong-un speaks volumes about how little the world knows about North Korea itself. Intelligence officials acknowledge that much of what they have gleaned is little more than conjecture, based on secondhand information from sources inside North Korea but not independently verified. The North Korean media have never shown images of Kim Jong-un in public or mentioned him by name, said Kim Sang-kook, a senior North Korea analyst at the Unification Ministry in Seoul. Until Mr. Fujimoto released the photo to the South Korean television network KBS in February, there had been no picture at all of the son. The chef said he was given the picture shortly before he fled to Japan in 2001. Mr. Fujimoto and most analysts say the son was born on Jan. 8, 1983, but others insist that he was born in 1984. Kim Jong-il apprenticed at important party and military posts for more than 20 years before officially assuming power after the death of his father, Kim Il-sung, in 1994. He appeared with his father in mass gatherings, and his photos decorated the walls of government buildings beside his father’s. No such early grooming has been reported for Kim Jong-un. Now, Kim Jong-il’s failing health is compelling Mr. Kim to begin a crash program to present his son as the next leader. But installing an untested young man at the top of abelligerent regime where septuagenarian veterans of political machinations jockeyfor power raises many questions. “We know almost nothing about the young man,” said Andrei Lankov, a Russian-born North Korea specialist at Kookmin University in Seoul. “Very young, without any administrative experience to speak of, and without his own coterie — he had not had time to create a power base. He will be an obedient puppet in the hands of people who lobbied for  this decision. Who are these people? I have no idea, to be frank.” The power elite will support another hereditary succession, to keep the peace, some analysts say. But “whoever the new leader is, it will be a collective leadership in name or actuality,” said Bruce Klingner at the Heritage Foundation, who has worked as a Korea analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency. Kim Jong-il had at least five children with three women. Sung Hae-rim, a movie star, gave birth to Kim Jong-nam, now 38. She became estranged from Kim Jong-il after he married Kim Young-sook, who gave birth to one daughter (some say two) but no son. Then Mr. Kim fell for Ko Young-hee, the prima donna of North Korea’s premier opera, who was born in Japan and emigrated to the North in the 1960s. She had two sons — Kim Jong-chol, now 28, and Kim Jong-un — and a daughter, Kim Yeo-jong, 22. Until Ms. Ko died of breast cancer in 2004, she was Mr. Kim’s de facto first lady and a fierce campaigner for her sons. With no mother to promote him to his father, Kim Jong-nam scuttled what remote chance he had of succession when he was caught and deported while sneaking into Japan on a fake passport in 2001. He was headed for Tokyo Disneyland. The middle son, Kim Jong-chol, attended theInternational School of Berne in Switzerlandin the 1990s under the pseudonym Pak Chol, according to analysts and journalists in Seoul, as well as Mr. Fujimoto — though other analysts dispute these accounts. He was said to be a fan of  Michael Jordan,  Eric Clapton and  Keanu Reeves. Mr. Fujimoto wrote that Ms. Ko often took her sons on trips to Europe and Tokyo Disneyland, and that Kim Jong-un learned English. Analysts are divided over whether Kim Jong-un also attended the school in Switzerland. They say he was enrolled from 2002 to 2007 in the Kim Il-sung Military University, a leading officer-training school in Pyongyang, the capital, but was taught at home. The son, these accounts say, is about 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighs more than 200 pounds. Mr. Fujimoto said in an interview that the young man he last saw in 2001 was stocky and athletic but not fat. He said Kim Jong-il dismissed Kim Jong-chol as “girlish” but openly complimented Kim Jong-un, saying, “That boy is like me.” The sons lived a life few North Koreans could imagine: swimming pools, water fountains, bowling alleys, billiard rooms, inline skating tracks, a beach, Jet Skis and horses. An episode relayed by Mr. Fujimoto and often cited by analysts to illustrate Kim Jong-un’s sequestered existence,  if not his leadership qualities, took place several years ago when the chef and Kim Jong-un were smoking a cigarette in a car. Mr. Kim, then 18, looked into the distance and, according to the chef’s account, said: “We are here, playing basketball, riding horses, riding Jet Skis, having fun together. But what of the lives of the average people?”

The permanent members of the Security Council have approved a draft resolution that expands export limits and financial restrictions, diplomats said.
==::==
2009-06-11T00:00:00Z
==::==
UNITED NATIONS— The Security Council’s five permanent members agreed on Wednesday on a draft resolution that would ratchet up sanctions againstNorth Koreaby concentrating on  its financial transactions and its arms industry, including allowing for inspections of its cargo vessels on the high seas. The sharply worded resolution, while diluting some of the sanctions sought by the West and Japan, would still serve notice on North Korea that its nuclear and other weapons programs had  created sufficient alarm to forge a rare unified front among the world’s major powers. Written by the United States, the resolution came after  more than two weeks of negotiations among the five permanent members — China, Russia, the United States, Britain and France — as well as with Japan and South Korea. It was presented to the full Security Council on Wednesday, and although no timetable for a vote was announced, it could come as early as Friday. Given its supporters, the measure seems assured of passing. Vitaly I. Churkin, the Russian ambassador, told reporters, “Having sanctions and things like that is not our choice, but a certain political message must be sent, and some measures must be taken, because we are facing a very real situation of proliferation risks.” North Korea did not react immediately, although its reclusive government has said in the past that ship inspections or other intrusive steps would be considered acts of war. If the resolution is approved, the next hurdle will be ensuring its highly technical provisions are all carried out. Not all resolutions are equally respected by United Nations member states, and, as Ambassador Jorge Urbina of Costa Rica noted, the draft resolution is complex. The biggest question mark involved China, which has been reluctant to deploy the full weight of its influence on North Korea out of fear of destabilizing it amid a leadership transition. But various analysts suggested that it would not have publicly backed such sanctions unless it was serious about responding to North Korea’s undergroundnuclear test on May 25. “They are deeply troubled by North Korean actions,” Jonathan D. Pollack, a professor of Asian and Pacific studies at the Naval War College, said in a telephone interview from Beijing. The nuclear test followed a series of confrontational actions taken by the North, largely reversing every step it had taken to abandon its nuclear program in recent years. “It is important for there to be consequences, and this sanctions regime, if passed by the Security Council, will bite and bite in a meaningful way,” said Susan E. Rice, the American ambassador, who shepherded the resolution through the negotiations. The United States and its allies had wanted the draft resolution to include mandatory cargo inspections, if there was reasonable suspicion that the cargo was weapons-related — something Washington had been seeking outside the United Nations during the Bush years through its Proliferation Security Initiative. But China and Russia balked at mandatory inspections. In a compromise, the resolution requests that states inspect ships on the high seas. If the country where the ship is registered decided to reject an inspection in international waters, then the country would be required to direct the vessel to a nearby harbor for an inspection. If neither happened, the episode would be reported to the Security Council’s sanctions committee. The resolution also suggests that states should cut off “bunkering” services, like refueling, for North Korean vessels. It is assumed that North Korea would balk at any inspections of its ships, analysts noted, and the resolution does not come under a United Nations provision that would allow the use of force as the ultimate fallback. The sanctions basically fleshed out measures that were first listed in a Security Council resolution passed after North Korea’s first nuclear test in 2006. They were never enacted, because the North agreed to participate in talks to dismantle the program. The draft resolution condemns the latest North Korean nuclear test, demanding that North Korea conduct no more tests and that it suspend its ballistic missile program and rejoin the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The theme salted throughout the resolution is choking off anything that might feed the country’s nuclear and weapons programs, including a complete arms embargo, with the exception of small weapons. Arms generate significant earnings for North Korea, Ms. Rice said, “and we think it important that that source of revenue be entirely curtailed.” Analysts said the proposed sanctions with the most bite might be the financial ones. They called upon member states to cut off financial services related to the North’s nuclear and weapons programs, to avoid any new grants or loans to the country and to halt other trade support like export credits. Financial transactions for humanitarian or development purposes would be allowed. William H. Tobey, the former senior Bush administration official for nuclear nonproliferation, who is now at Harvard’s Belfer Center, said that North Korea imported about $3 billion in goods annually, $2 billion of it from China. It exports about $1.5 billion legally, so it needs significant credit to make up the difference. “It would put a significant crimp in their ability to import,” he said of the financial sanctions. In recent years, efforts to sanction rogue states like Zimbabwe have foundered on the split between Russia and China, on one side, and Western nations on the other. The fact that all five permanent Security Council members agreed on the draft showed how seriously they viewed the gradual global decay in the nuclear nonproliferation treaty — a message aimed not only at North Korea but at other countries suspected of trying to developnuclear weapons, like Iran. “They have to get North Korea right, because it has implications for the entire nonproliferation regime,” said Robert C. Orr, the United Nations assistant secretary-general for policy planning.

American journalists Euna Lee and Laura Ling have already paid a huge price for doing their job. They should be freed immediately.

North Korea’s bankrupt justice system has delivered a cruel verdict — 12 years of hard labor —  to the American journalists Euna Lee and Laura Ling. After a detention of nearly three months in perhaps the world’s most repressive country, they have already paid a huge and unfair price for doing their job. They should be released immediately. Ms. Ling, 32, and Ms. Lee, 36, were detained on March 17 by North Korean soldiers patrolling the border between China and North Korea. They were employed by Current TV, a San Francisco-based media company that was co-founded by Al Gore, the former vice president. News accounts said they were reporting on North Korean refugees who had fled the country — a highly sensitive issue — although Ms. Ling’s sister told ABC News that the women were working on a report about the trafficking of women from North Korea to China. Whatever the case, they do not deserve to be sent to a brutal labor camp where, according to international human rights activists and North Korean defectors, detainees endure beatings, hunger and inhumane workloads. With no access to lawyers or due process, the two journalists did not have anything approaching a fair chance to defend themselves. We don’t know how much their ordeal is being driven by North Korea’s succession saga or escalating tensions with the United States over Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons program. We know that there is no excuse for their detention or this outrageous sentence. North Korea has shown leniency to Americans in the past. In 1996, on a drunken dare, Evan Hunziker swam across the Yalu River from China and was accused of spying and was detained for three months. He was freed after Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, who at the time was a congressman, traveled to Pyongyang, North Korea’s capital, to plead for his release. In 1994, Mr. Richardson also negotiated the release of an American pilot shot down over North Korea. We hope the Obama administration is vigorously working the few diplomatic levers available. It should urge China, North Korea’s main food and fuel supplier, to speak up for the two journalists and send an American envoy to make the case directly in Pyongyang. Failing to free them would only worsen relations with President Obama, who came into office committed to reviving negotiations, and add to growing calls in Washington — and around the world — for tougher sanctions.

The possible shipment of an intercontinental ballistic missile could be a sign that North Korea might be planning another long-range missile test.
==::==
2009-05-31T00:00:00Z
==::==
A senior American official on Saturday confirmed South Korean news reports that the North seemed to be preparing to ship an intercontinental ballistic missile toward a testing site on the waters between Korea and Japan, a sign thatNorth Koreamight be planning another long-range missile test. It would probably take several weeks for the missile to reach the site and be put in place, and there was still no evidence that the North Koreans had the technology to create a nuclear device small enough to fit atop a missile. The North Koreans have conducted two such tests before,including one over Japanese territory, and American officials are particularly concerned about Japan’s reaction to another test. Such missiles could theoretically reach Alaska and Hawaii. The news comes as North Korea has been test-firing short-range missiles since Monday, when it conducted an underground nuclear test. North Korea last test-fired a long-range missile on April 5. That test did not achieve its goal of putting a satellite into orbit.

Political uncertainty and Kim Jong-il’s questionable health are two of the issues that contribute to a diplomatic challenge facing the Obama administration.
==::==
2009-05-27T00:00:00Z
==::==
WASHINGTON — In dealing withNorth Korea, American officials are reduced to studying two-month-old photographs of its reclusive leader,Kim Jong-il, to calculate how long he is likely to  live. The new administration’s North Korea team includes a special emissary who works part time as an academic dean and a State Department official who has yet to be confirmed by Congress. And as President Obama tries to find a way to punish North Korea forits latest nuclear test and missile launchings, his senior aides acknowledge that every policy option employed by previous presidents over the past dozen years — whether hard or soft, political or economic — has been fruitless instopping North Korea from building a nuclear weapon. “As much as they understood this was going to be an issue, they weren’t ready for a nuclear test in May,” Marcus Noland, an expert on North Korea at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said of Mr. Obama and his advisers. “They’re in a situation now where they have to contain and manage a crisis.” That crisis, officials and independent experts said, is all the more treacherous because of the deep political uncertainty in North Korea. American officials say they believe that Mr. Kim, in rapidly declining health, ismaneuvering to make his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, his successor, perhaps after a period in which his brother-in-law, Jang Seong-taek, would serve as a regent. The nuclear test and the test-firing of six short-range missiles, the American officials said, must be understood within the context of this internal struggle to extend the Kim dynasty’s rule for another generation. But they warn that the information coming out of North Korea is frustratingly vague and inconclusive. Mr. Kim, officials noted, skipped a recent meeting with Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov. Chatter about the health of Mr. Kim  has spiked in Beijing and in Seoul, where North Korea-watching is an obsession. Even a recent official photo of Mr. Kim, which shows him alive but feeble, is open to conflicting interpretations, an official said: it may be that North Korea wants to show that he is still in control, or it may be that it is signaling that the end is near and appealing for help in a perilous transition. “People who tell you they know what’s going on there don’t know,” said one official, who spoke anonymously because he was not authorized to speak publicly. “What’s undeniable is that there are substantial challenges to all the previous approaches to North Korea.” Of the options still on the table, the measures that the Obama administration seems most drawn to would constrain the North Korean government’s access to funds. These steps, which would be carried out by the Treasury Department either openly or covertly, would be directed at banks in Europe and the Middle East that are used by the Kim family, officials said. The administration may also raise its pressure on China and South Korea to cut off investments in North Korea — a delicate task, given Beijing’s reluctance to appear to bow to American influence. Finally, the United States and South Korea could start boarding ships traveling to and from North Korea that they suspect are carrying nuclear technology. But American officials said they were wary of doing that because of the risk of a military confrontation. The United States, experts say, has little choice but to continue negotiating with North Korea through the six-nation process, which also includes South Korea, China, Russia and Japan. The Obama administration may have to dispense with the usual bag of carrots and sticks, however. “The North Korean leadership cares about internal matters, not external matters,” said Wendy R. Sherman, who coordinated North Korea policy in the Clinton administration. “They care about external matters only insofar as it helps ensure the survival of the regime.” Under those circumstances, she said, North Korea is not likely to be receptive to incentives. And it may have concluded that havingnuclear weaponsis a necessity for its own preservation. The detention of two American television journalists by North Korea injects another combustible element. The two journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, were arrested in March andcharged with illegally entering the country with “hostile” intent. Their trial, set for June 4, “is a risk but also a possibility,” depending on how the North handles the case, Ms. Sherman said. All of this adds up to a formidable diplomatic challenge for the Obama administration, at a time when its energies are being consumed by Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran. North Korea lacks the  high-powered attention that those countries are receiving. The special representative for North Korea policy, Stephen W. Bosworth, is a well-regarded diplomat and a former ambassador to South Korea. But he divides his time between this assignment and the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, where he is dean. Kurt M. Campbell, an Asia security expert nominated to become the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, is likely to play a significant role. But he has not yet been confirmed. The State Department spokesman, Ian C. Kelly, said Mr. Bosworth took part in meetings on North Korea by phone from New York on Monday and was in Washington on Tuesday. “Ambassador Bosworth is fully engaged, full-time engaged,” he said. Among the other influential players on North Korea policy, officials said, are James B. Steinberg, deputy secretary of state, and Jeffrey A. Bader, senior director for Asian affairs on the National Security Council. Mr. Steinberg will attend a regional security conference in Singapore this week, where he will accompany Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates to meetings with defense ministers from Japan and South Korea, the Pentagon said. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, the first senior American official to speak openly about how a succession struggle would complicate dealings with North Korea, has worked the phones over the past three days. But, officials said, it is ultimately Mr. Obama, a young president at the dawn of his administration, who will have to decide how to deal with Mr. Kim, an aging leader at the twilight of his.

In a message to the former American envoy, North Korean officials said they are willing to move forward with denuclearization talks.
==::==

==::==
BEIJING (AP) — North Korean officials have expressed their willingness to move forward with long-stalled denuclearization talks and played down recent reports that the government is preparing to test-fire a long-range missile, a former American diplomat said Saturday after a private visit toNorth Korea. The message given to the former envoy, Stephen W. Bosworth, was a softening of North Korea’s increasingly belligerent rhetoric recently. Over the past few weeks, the government has declared that it would scrap peace agreements with South Korea, warned that the divided peninsula was on the brink of war and appeared to be preparing to test a missile capable of reaching the western United States. Mr. Bosworth, the former American ambassador to South Korea and now an academic, said the officials he met with kept an upbeat tone regarding the nuclear talks and a willingness to talk to President Obama’s administration. “We can continue to work towards eventual denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” Mr. Bosworth said after arriving at Beijing’s international airport. “They understand the Obama administration will need some time to sort itself through the policy review and they expressed patience, there is no sense of alarm or urgency.” Mr. Bosworth, the dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University in Massachusetts, said the delegation of academics he was traveling with expressed concern about any potential missile launching plans. “We indicated there was concern that they might be preparing for a missile launch; they said that we should all wait and see,” he said. Mr. Bosworth did not give the names of the officials he met with during the five-day visit, but said they were from the foreign affairs, military and economic ministries. His group was on a private visit and not representing the United States government. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is expected to name a special representative for North Korea, but the timing is uncertain.

SEOUL, South Korea — More than a month after his absence from an important anniversary parade fueled theories that he had suffered a stroke,North Korea’s leader,Kim Jong-il, was reported by state media on Saturday to have inspected a military unit. Later Saturday, state television carried still pictures of Mr. Kim chatting with the soldiers, clapping his hands and watching military training. They were the first pictures of him released in nearly two months. The Korean Central News Agency reported that Mr. Kim, 66, had visited an all-female artillery company. The exact location and the date of what was described as a visit to a frontline unit were not disclosed. Accompanied by his top military aides, Mr. Kim watched shooting practice and inspected the barracks, the mess hall and a supply room before posing for pictures with the soldiers, the agency said. North Korea’s Central Television later released still photographs of Mr. Kim’s visit. In one picture carried by South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency, Mr. Kim, wearing his trademark black sunglasses and zip-up Mao suit, stood on a verdant hill, surrounded by North Korean Army officers. Yonhap said that in the photos Mr. Kim appeared to have lost some weight but was active. It was the second time in a week that North Korea had reported a public appearance by Mr. Kim. The previous Saturday, the state news agency said Mr. Kim had watched a soccer match, but it did not release photos or video, nor did it say when or where the game took place. That was his first reported public appearance since mid-August. The new agency report, though it was filed early Saturday, was listed as the last dispatch for Friday, the 63rd anniversary of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea.  International observers were watching for some sign that the government would use the occasion to try to dispel speculation about Mr. Kim’s health. After he missed a parade on Sept. 9 for the 60th anniversary of the founding of North Korea, South Korean and American officials said they believed he had had a stroke.

Hinting at a wider cultural thaw, a concert by the New York Philharmonic was the first permitted by an American orchestra in the country.

PYONGYANG,North Korea— As theNew York Philharmonicplayed the opening notes of “Arirang,” a beloved Korean folk song, a murmur rippled through the audience. Many in the audience perched forward in their seats. The piccolo played a long, plaintive melody. Cymbals crashed, harp runs flew up, the violins soared. And tears began forming in the eyes of the staid audience, row upon row of men in dark suits, women in colorful high-waisted dresses called hanbok and all of them wearing pins with the likeness of Kim Il-sung, the nation’s founder. And right there, the Philharmonic had them. The full-throated performance of a piece deeply resonant for both North and South Koreans ended the  historic concert in this isolated nation on Tuesday in triumph. On Wednesday, North Korea’s main state-controlled daily newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, gave a brief account of the concert, with a picture of the orchestra, on an inside page. Of Lorin Maazel, the Philharmonic’s music director, it said, “His performance was very sophisticated and sensitive.” The audience applauded for more than five minutes, and orchestra members, some of them crying, waved. People in the seats cheered and waved back, reluctant to let the visitors  leave. “Was that an emotional experience!” said Jon Deak, a bass player, backstage moments after the concert had ended. “It’s an incredible joy and sadness and connection like I’ve never seen. They really opened their hearts to us.” The “Arirang” rendition also proved moving for the orchestra’s eight members of Korean origin. “It brought tears to my eyes,” said Michelle Kim, a violinist whose parents moved from the North to Seoul, South Korea, during the Korean War. The piece was part of a program carefully constructed to showcase the orchestra and its tradition. A State Department official who accompanied Zarin Mehta, the orchestra’s president, on a planning trip to Pyongyang, the North’s capital, last year suggested that “Arirang” be played, Mr. Mehta said. The emotional setting took a turn away from the political theme that had dominated the visit, which began on Monday and ends on Wednesday, when the orchestra flies to Seoul. It was the first time an American cultural organization had appeared here, and the largest contingent of United States citizens to appear since the Korean War. The trip has been suffused with political importance since North Korea’s invitation came to light last year. It was seen by some as an opening for warmer relations with the United States, which North Korea has long reviled. The concert brought a “whole new dimension from what we expected,” Mr. Maazel told reporters afterward. “We just went out and did our thing, and we began to feel this warmth coming back.” He suggested that there would be a bigger impact. “I think it’s going to do a great deal,” he said. “I was told 200 million people were watching. That’s important for the people who want relations to improve.” The concert was broadcast live in many nations, including in North Korea. “If it does come to be seen in retrospect as a historical moment,” he added, “we will all be very proud.” Still, there was little indication that the good will generated by the visit would affect a critical issue: North Korea’s nuclear program, and efforts to determine the extent of it. At a banquet following the concert, Song Sok-hwan, the vice-minister of culture, said: “All the members of the New York Philharmonic opened the hearts of the Korean people.”  He called the concert “an important occasion to open a chapter of mutual understanding between the two countries.” It did not appear that the country’s leader, Kim Jong-il, was present at the concert. High-ranking officials did attend, including the vice president of the Presidium of the Supreme People’s Assembly, the vice culture minister and the chairman of the Pyongyang People’s Committee, akin to mayor. In Washington, on Tuesday, the White House played down the significance of the concert, while criticizing the North for failing to meet its commitments to disarm. Dana Perino, the White House press secretary, said the performance neither hurt nor helped American diplomatic efforts. “At the end of the day, we consider this concert to be a concert,” Ms. Perino said, “and it’s not a diplomatic coup.” At the outset, the sound of the American national anthem at the East Pyongyang Grand Theater was striking. The North Korean anthem came first, and the audience stood for both. The flags of both countries flanked the stage, which was separated from the audience by a bank of flowers. The players moved on to the prelude to Act III of Wagner’s “Lohengrin” and Dvorak’s “New World” Symphony. Then Mr. Maazel introduced the next work, “American in Paris” by Gershwin. “Someday a composer may write a work titled ‘Americans in Pyongyang,’ ” he said. In Korean, he added, “Enjoy!” The audience, mostly stone-faced until then, grew slightly more animated. For an encore, Mr. Maazel introduced the overture to “Candide” by Leonard Bernstein, which the orchestra played conductorless, in homage to Bernstein, a former Philharmonic music director. The concert evoked other orchestra missions to repressive states, like the Boston Symphony Orchestra’s visit to the Soviet Union in 1956, followed soon after by a Philharmonic visit, and the Philadelphia Orchestra’s trip to China in 1973. At a news conference earlier in the day, Mr. Maazel drew a distinction between Tuesday night’s concert and the Philharmonic’s visit to the Soviet Union. “It showed Soviet citizens that they could have relations with foreign organizations and these organizations could come in the country freely,” he said. “But what the Soviets didn’t realize was this was a two-edged sword, because by doing so they allowed people from outside the country to interact with their own people, and to have an influence. It was so long lasting that eventually the people in power found themselves out of power” in a country that was a “global threat.” “The Korean Peninsula is a very small area geographically,” Mr. Maazel said, “and has an entirely different role to play in the course of human events.” Drawing a parallel, he added, “would do a disservice to the people who live here and are trying to do their art and make a better world for themselves and all of us.”

TheNew York Philharmonic’s concert inNorth Koreaon Feb. 26 will be broadcast that evening on WNET, Channel 13,  and distributed  two days later onPBS, broadcast officials said Wednesday. In an unusual arrangement, ABC News will cooperate with WNET, New York’s public television station, to produce the broadcast.Bob Woodruff, a correspondent for  ABC News  who has reported from the tightly closed North, will provide “behind-the-scenes coverage” of the concert, WNET said. Because of the time difference, the concert will actually take place before dawn New York time on Feb. 26. A live broadcast will be made available for any takers by EuroArts Music International, which produces and distributes classical music programming and has the rights to the broadcast outside  South Korea. One place where the broadcast is still uncertain is North Korea itself. Government officials there have not said whether the concert will be shown on local television, according to Eric Latzky, the Philharmonic’s spokesman. Given North Korea’s deep isolation and the government’s tight control  over its citizens, the broadcast issue is of crucial interest. Orchestra officials said they had pressed hard to have the concert shown on North Korean television, to ensure that it would be heard by more than just a small audience of dignitaries. The broadcast of any event from North Korea is  rare. The joint WNET-ABC News effort came from a desire to jump on the newsworthy nature of the event, said Neal Shapiro,  president and chief executive of WNET’s parent, the Educational Broadcasting Corporation, which also includes WLIW, Channel 21, on Long Island. Mr. Shapiro is a former producer at ABC News and president of NBC News. “I didn’t want to just show a concert,” he said in a phone interview. “It was a historic place at a historic time.” Mr. Shapiro continued, “What makes it so interesting is the very nature of North Korea and what it means to have an organization steeped in everything that the free world implies, the center of culture and capitalism, making an appearance in North Korea.” So, he said, “I called up my friends at ABC News and said, ‘Why not do something together?’ ” Mr. Shapiro said that Mr. Woodruff would provide commentary and reporting, ABC News  might  provide related footage, and the package would be assembled in New York the day of the concert. “It’s what we would call crashing, in the TV business,” he said. The orchestra leaves Thursday for a long tour of Taiwan and China, including Hong Kong. In December it accepted an invitation by North Korea to visit amid a longstanding effort of diplomatic engagement by the United States, intended mainly to induce North Korea to end its nuclear program. The concert in the capital, Pyongyang, and another in Seoul were added to the tour. This would be the first major cultural visit by Americans to North Korea. The State Department has backed the trip as a potential opening for the country toward the outside world. The trip coalesced during an optimistic time in negotiations over the  nuclear program. But efforts have sputtered in recent months. The North missed a year-end deadline to disclose all its nuclear programs. The orchestra will play at the East Pyongyang Grand Theater, performing Dvorak’s Symphony No. 9 (“From the New World”), Gershwin’s “American in Paris” and the Prelude to Act III of Wagner’s “Lohengrin.” The broadcast will also be of some financial interest to the orchestra. Once the cost of production is recouped,  it can share in the profits from DVDs and television distribution, said Thomas Baer, an executive producer of EuroArts. South Korea’s Munwha Broadcasting Company, a producer,  will provide the equipment for the telecast, trucking it across the border. ARTE France is also a producer. Mr. Baer said the production was extraordinarily complicated. “This one involves doing a first-class broadcast and distributing it from a country that has no infrastructure in the area in which we are operating,” he said. “All the equipment, down to generators and cable, has to be brought into the country from South Korea. You can’t go down to the rental place and swap out a lens in Pyongyang.” Mr. Baer  said North Korean government officials had been cooperative. “It’s very hard for the North Korean authorities to deal with this kind of onslaught of people they would never see,” he said.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreasaid Friday that it had already explained enough about its nuclear programs to meet a deadline for declaring its nuclear activities, saying the information was in a nuclear declaration it prepared in November and gave to the United States. The statement from the North Korean Foreign Ministry on Friday was carried by the Korean Central News Agency, North Korea’s voice  to the outside world. It was the country’s first official pronouncement after it missed a Dec. 31 deadline to disable its main nuclear complex at Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang, and, according to other nations involved in six-nation talks, failed to provide a full list of its nuclear activities, including weapons, facilities and fissile material. The statement said that North Korea had already conducted “enough discussions” with the United States officials after they demanded more negotiations on its November draft declaration. Using the abbreviation of the North’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the Foreign Ministry said, “As far as the nuclear declaration on which wrong opinion is being built up by some quarters is concerned, the D.P.R.K. has done what it should do.” In Washington, officials disputed North Korea’s claims, saying the government in Pyongyang had not yet provided a declaration. They muted their criticism, however, and said that issue had not reached an impasse. “The North Koreans know what’s expected of them and what the rest of the parties are looking for, and that is a full and complete and accurate declaration of their nuclear activity,” said Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman. “They know that.” The chief American negotiator, Assistant Secretary of State Christopher R. Hill, left Washington on Friday en route to China, where the status of North Korea’s adherence to its commitments to dismantle its nuclear weapons program will be the focus of a new round of negotiations. An administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the situation, played down the North Korean statement, saying it followed a pattern of public posturing in advance of new talks. Since the passing of the deadline, agreed on in October,  the United States, South Korea and Japan have criticized the North and called for details on how much plutonium it had produced at Yongbyon, whether it had provided nuclear assistance to Syria and what it had done with tons of aluminum tubes it had bought from Russia, the type that could be used to build centrifuges to enrich uranium. The State Department’s spokesman, Sean McCormack, said that the United States and the other countries involved in the talks had not reacted more strongly to the missed deadline because foreign nuclear experts were continuing their work to dismantle the Yongbyon plant, hoping through that work to learn more about aspects of North Korea’s nuclear program. “We’re breaking new ground here,” Mr. McCormack said. “This hasn’t been done before.” Earlier in the day, North Korea also renewed its threat to bolster its “war deterrent,” a phrase it uses for its nuclear arsenal. The North, with one of the world’s largest standing armies, usually threatens to bolster its deterrent when it feels international pressure in crucial negotiations. North Korea has acknowledged building bombs with plutonium, but has denied pursuing an alternative weapons program using enriched uranium. In the October deal that North Korea struck with the United States, South Korea, Japan, China and Russia, it promised to disable its nuclear facilities and give a full list of its nuclear programs in exchange for one million tons of heavy fuel oil, or its economic equivalent, and diplomatic concessions. It has so far received 150,000 tons of oil and 5,010 tons of steel products to renovate its aging power plants. On Friday, North Korea accused the United States and other countries of delaying the fulfillment of their commitments to provide the aid and remove the North from American terrorism and trade blacklists. “We still hold hope that the Oct. 3 agreement will be implemented smoothly if all countries participating in the six-party talks make sincere efforts based on the principle of action for action,” the statement said. North Korea said the disablement work at Yongbyon was “completed within the technologically possible scope as of Dec. 31.” But since the aid delivery “has not been done even 50 percent,” the North had to “adjust the speed of the nuclear disablement process,” it said. The work of unloading spent fuel rods from the North’s nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, a crucial part of the disablement, will take an additional 100 days, it said.

North Korearemained silent as the last hours of 2007 passed and it missed a year-end deadline to give a full accounting of its nuclear weapons. It gave no explanation for breaking its promise to the United States, China, Japan, Russia and South Korea, and it faced no outcry.  “We’ve seen these kinds of delays or other things occur in the process as we move along, and in some ways I think you have expect those things,” said Tom Casey, a State Department spokesman. In Crawford, Tex., where President Bush was vacationing, a White House spokesman, Scott M. Stanzel, said: “I think we had all hoped that North Korea would meet the Dec. 31 deadline. We hope they will do that as soon as possible.” The Japanese Foreign Ministry called the missed deadline “unfortunate.” The South Korean Foreign Ministry said it was “regrettable.” Russia and China were silent on the issue.

WASHINGTON  (Reuters)  —North Koreahas not met its commitment to  account fully  for its nuclear activities by the end of 2007 under a disarmament agreement, the United States said  Sunday, urging North Korea to comply with its obligations. North Korea, which tested a nuclear device in 2006, is facing a deadline at 11 a.m., Eastern time,  on Dec. 31  to disclose  details of its nuclear program under a disarmament-for-aid deal it reached with the United States, China, Russia, Japan and South Korea. “It is unfortunate that North Korea has not yet met its commitments by providing a complete and correct declaration of its nuclear programs and slowing down the process of disablement,” a State Department spokesman, Tom Casey, said in a statement. “We urge North Korea to deliver a complete and correct declaration of all its nuclear weapons programs and nuclear weapons and proliferation activities and complete the agreed disablement.” American and South Korean officials have called on North Korea to say how much plutonium it has produced  —  about 110 pounds  by the United States’ estimates  —  and respond to  American suspicions about a secret program to enrich uranium for weapons.

In the first significant cultural visit by Americans, the New York Philharmonic plans to visit Pyongyang.
==::==
2007-12-10T00:00:00Z

Adding a cultural wrinkle to the diplomatic engagement between the United States andNorth Korea, theNew York Philharmonicplans  to visit Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, in February, taking the legacy of Beethoven, Bach and Bernstein to one of the world’s most isolated nations. The trip, at the invitation of North Korea, will be the first significant cultural visit by Americans to that country, and it comes as the United States is offering the possibility of warmer ties with a country that President Bush once consigned to the “axis of evil.” “We haven’t even had Ping-Pong diplomacy with these people,” said Ambassador Christopher R. Hill, the Bush administration’s main diplomat for negotiations with North Korea and the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs. Just last week Mr. Bush sent a letter to Kim Jong-il, North Korea’s leader, suggesting that ties would improve if North Korea fully disclosed all nuclear programs and   got rid of  its nuclear weapons. Conservatives have criticized the Bush administration for engaging with North Korea when it has violated  nuclear promises, and in the face of recent intelligence indicating its possible assistance to Syria in beginning work on a reactor. State Department officials said the orchestra’s invitation from North Korea and its acceptance represented a potential opening in that Communist nation’s relationship with the outside world, and a softening of its unrelenting anti-United States propaganda. “It would signal that North Korea is beginning to come out of its shell, which everyone understands is a long-term process,” Mr. Hill said. “It does represent a shift in how they view us, and it’s the sort of shift that can be helpful as we go forward in nuclear weapons negotiations.” The Philharmonic’s trip, which has generated some controversy among orchestra musicians and commentators, will follow a venerable line of groundbreaking orchestra tours that have played a role in diplomacy, the most famous one, perhaps, taking place in 1973, when the Philadelphia Orchestra traveled to China soon after President Nixon’s historic visit and amid what came to be known as Ping-Pong diplomacy. In 1956 the Boston Symphony was the first major American orchestra to travel to the Soviet Union. The New York Philharmonic, under Leonard Bernstein, went three years later. Of the Philharmonic’s excursion, Mr. Hill said, “I hope it will be looked back upon as an event that helped bring that country back into the world.” The Philharmonic, led by its music director, Lorin Maazel, has been considering the visit since an invitation arrived by fax in August. It was a typed letter from the North Korean culture ministry, in English, accompanied by a cover letter from a private individual in California who said he was acting as an intermediary. The orchestra had the invitation authenticated by the State Department, which has provided advice and help in negotiating the terms of the visit. Mr. Hill said that he did not know how the invitation had come about. But its timing was significant, after a series of breakthroughs in a decade-long effort to have North Korea halt its nuclear program. In February North Korea agreed to shut down its main reactor in exchange for economic aid and other inducements. The reactor was switched off in July, a month before the invitation. And in September the Bush administration said that North Korea had agreed to disable its main nuclear fuel plant and give an accounting of its nuclear facilities, fuel and weapons by the end of the year. Progress toward the Philharmonic’s visit accelerated when orchestra executives and a State Department official visited Pyongyang in October. The final major logistical pieces of the concert fell into place late last week, after a visit to Seoul, the capital of South Korea, by Zarin Mehta, the orchestra’s president. The Philharmonic’s spokesman, Eric Latzky, confirmed that the trip was on, but he declined to discuss details publicly until a news conference at Avery Fisher Hall tomorrow, when it is to be formally announced. Mr. Hill, who was in Pyongyang last week delivering Mr. Bush’s letter and inspecting nuclear facilities, said he planned to attend the news conference. He has spoken privately to the orchestra members. Even more surprising, the Philharmonic said that Pak Kil-yon, North Korea’s representative to the United Nations, would also attend, a rare public appearance by a North Korean diplomat. Mr. Hill said he believed that the conditions sought by the Philharmonic had been met. They included the presence of foreign journalists; a nationwide broadcast to ensure that not just a small elite would hear the concert; acoustical adjustments to the East Pyongyang Grand Theater; an assurance that the eight Philharmonic members of Korean origin would not encounter difficulties; and that the orchestra could play “The Star-Spangled Banner.” Once the orchestra members had given their approval, the major stumbling block became transportation. The orchestra, staff members and journalists are expected to number about 250. A plane that can also carry the many large instruments had to be found. Asiana Airlines, a South Korean carrier, offered such a plane, provided that financing could be secured, said Evans Revere, a former senior United States diplomat who is president of the Korea Society, which helped plan the visit. MBC, one of three main broadcasters in South Korea, offered to pay for the charter in exchange for the rights to broadcast an extra concert by the Philharmonic in Seoul on its return from Pyongyang, Mr. Revere said. “The balance that’s being achieved here is pretty nifty,” he said. “It’s a nice message being sent to the peninsula that the premier American orchestra is performing in both capitals within hours of each other.” One of the remaining loose ends is the procurement of climate-controlled trucks to transport instruments to and from the airport. One possibility is arranging for South Korean trucks to be driven across the border. The North Korean government can be unpredictable, and there is always the possibility that the visit could be derailed. The concert is planned for Feb. 26 at the end of a previously planned tour in China. The orchestra is expected to stay in Pyongyang for two nights, with some teaching and a ceremonial dinner thrown in. Some questions have been raised about the appropriateness of visiting a country run by one of the world’s most repressive governments. North Korea’s policies have been blamed in part for the famine-related starvation of perhaps two million people and it confines hundreds of thousands of people in labor camps. If the orchestra goes to Pyongyang, “it will be doing little more than participating in a puppet show whose purpose is to lend legitimacy to a despicable regime,” Terry Teachout, an arts critic and blogger, wrote on the online opinion pages of The Wall Street Journal in late October. Richard V. Allen, a national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan, and Chuck Downs — both board members of the United States Committee for Human Rights in North Korea — made a similar point on Oct. 28 on the Op-Ed page  of The New York Times. “It would be a mistake to hand Kim Jong-il a propaganda coup,” they wrote. Mr. Hill acknowledged that “in a very theoretical way” any kind of opening lends legitimacy to the North Korean government. “But not opening up has not had any positive effect in bringing North Korea out of its shell,” he said. Mr. Latzky declined to discuss the concert program, but orchestra officials have said from the beginning that it would probably include American music.

Roh Moo-hyun is only the second South Korean president to visit since the two Koreas were divided.
==::==
2007-10-03T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL, South Korea, Oct. 2 — Stepping into the international spotlight at a delicate time for his isolated   government, the reclusive North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, welcomed PresidentRoh Moo-hyunof South Korea to Pyongyang, the North’s capital, on Tuesday  for three days of talks. It was only the second meeting between leaders of the two Koreas since they were  divided 60 years ago, and Mr. Kim had mobilized a huge crowd to welcome Mr. Roh, who came with offers of peace and economic aid. The North Korean leader himself was dour and reserved, a  contrast to his effusive manner in 2000, during the first such meeting, when he hugged Kim Dae-jung, then the South Korean president, a scene that softened his image in South Korea and beyond. On Tuesday morning, Pyongyang’s usually drab sidewalks blossomed with color as North Koreans, dressed in their holiday best, waved pink and red paper flowers, according to South Korean television reports from Pyongyang. Hundreds of thousands of spectators erupted into well-choreographed chants of “hurray” and “unify the fatherland” as Mr. Roh rode through central Pyongyang in an open limousine with Kim Yong-nam, who is the North’s nominal head of state but ranks second to Mr. Kim. Mr. Roh travels with a bold initiative: ifNorth Koreaagrees to work toward reducing a half century of animosity with arms cuts, the South will help rebuild the North’s moribund economy, creating a “joint economic community” as a prelude to eventual reunification. Mr. Roh will also test Kim Jong-il’s willingness to give up his nuclear arsenal in return for economic rewards and diplomatic relations with the United States and other countries. Mr. Roh’s aides say  the summit meeting, together with recent progress in six-nation talks on North Korea’s nuclear disarmament, is a sign that the North is cautiously embracing more cooperation and reform. But some analysts warn that the meeting may also be another tactical move by Mr. Kim to obtain more economic concessions without giving up his nuclear arsenal. In his journey to Pyongyang by car early Tuesday, Mr. Roh  traveled  three and a half hours from Seoul, the South Korean capital. He was accompanied by industry leaders, politicians, cultural figures and scholars. About 30 miles north of Seoul, Mr. Roh stepped out of his vehicle to make the symbolic gesture of walking across the border that divides the Koreas. He was the first South Korean leader to cross it on foot. In 2000, Kim Dae-jung flew to Pyongyang. “This line is a wall that has divided the nation for a half-century,” Mr. Roh said, as he stepped across a yellow strip with the words “peace and prosperity” written on it. “Our people have suffered from too many hardships, and development has been held up due to this wall. This line will be gradually erased and the wall will fall.” Mr. Roh said that if they tried, the two Koreas “can travel together on the road toward co-prosperity while coexisting in peace.” Formal talks with Kim Jong-il begin Wednesday. The two Koreas remain technically at war since the Korean War ended in a cease-fire in 1953.

BEIJING, July 19
 — Delegates to the six-nation talks aimed at disarmingNorth Koreaof its nuclear weapons said they had failed to set a timetable for disarmament during meetings that were scheduled to end on Friday. The chief United States envoy, Assistant Secretary of State Christopher R. Hill, tried to put a positive face on the disappointing result, saying that substantial progress had been made during the talks, but that “working groups” of experts from the participating countries would need to devise plans for the timing and sequencing of further steps. “The consensus was that given our not very successful effort with dates in the spring that we would want to have the working groups” help devise modalities to achieve the objectives of the second round of the talks. Mr. Hill said of the outstanding goals, “I feel it is quite feasible by the end of the year.” Mr. Hill said there was broad agreement over the goals for the next phase of the disarmament process. These include the permanent disabling of a nuclear reactor complex at Yongbyon, a required comprehensive declaration by North Korea of its nuclear weapons and other nuclear materials and the delivery of nearly a million tons of heavy fuel oil promised to North Korea in an agreement reached last February, once it has met its obligations. Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Association, who returned to North Korea last week after being expelled in 2002, at the start of the current nuclear crisis, confirmed this week that North Korea had shut down its reactor at Yongbyon, 60 miles north of Pyongyang, the capital, as well as its reprocessing plant where the spent fuel is turned into bomb fuel. They also confirmed that the North Koreans had stopped work on their nuclear power plant at Taechon. The activity by the North Koreans followed the resolution of a $25 million international banking dispute involving the United States and North Korea. Mr. Hill said he had established “good understanding” in talks with his North Korean counterpart. “There were very little polemics, very little sort of wandering off into other areas,” Mr. Hill said. But he added that he expected issues to become more complicated in the future, as the process moved toward actual disarmament. “This is terra incognito, you know, we haven’t done this before,” he said of the future steps. “So I think we can look ahead to some difficulties, but we’ll manage the difficulties.” The talks, which involve the United States, North and South Korea, China, Japan and Russia, had been scheduled for two days, but they were extended for a third day in order for the parties to meet with China’s foreign minister, and for China to issue a final declaration. While Mr. Hill emphasized a positive tone throughout the talks, Japan and North Korea continued to be at odds over the issue of 13 Japanese citizens that North Korea has acknowledged abducting in the 1970s and 1980s. North Korea says it has returned all of the surviving abductees, and its Foreign Ministry on Thursday warned Japan against raising the issue in the six-nation talks. Japan says it suspects that more of its citizens are being held against their will in the North, and it has excluded aid to North Korea until it receives a fuller accounting. A Japanese diplomat at the talks said that without progress on bilateral issues, there was “no prospect of change” in Japan’s policy.

BEIJING, June 18 —North Koreacould be ready to begin shutting down its plutonium-producing reactor within weeks as the first step toward disabling it by the end of this year, the top United States negotiator on North Korea’s nuclear weapons program said here on Monday. The negotiator, Christopher R. Hill, assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs, said  stalled efforts to dismantle North Korea’s nuclear weapons program could move ahead after a visit by nuclear inspectors. North Korea has invited inspectors from theInternational Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations’ nuclear monitoring program, to visit for talks about verifying and monitoring a shutdown. “This is an event we have been looking forward to for some time,” Mr. Hill said after talks with his Chinese counterpart, Wu Dawei. The atomic energy agency said it would send a team to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, next week to discuss how its inspectors would verify the shutdown, The Associated Press reported from Vienna. North Korea had refused to proceed with a February agreement to begin decommissioning its reactor in Yongbyon until $25 million in accounts linked to North Korea held in a Macao bank was transferred to North Korea. The money was frozen when the United States accused the bank, Banco Delta Asia, of complicity in financial crimes on behalf of North Korea. After months of wrangling over the method of returning the money, it  was  wired Thursday to the Federal Reserve Bank in New York. It was  then to be sent to Russia’s central bank before a further transfer to an account controlled by North Korea in a Russian commercial bank. Mr. Hill said he would hold further talks this week with disarmament negotiators from Russia, South Korea and Japan on steps to make up for some of the time lost while the transfer was being organized. These discussions would also involve setting a timetable for resumption of six-nation arms control talks. Under the agreement reached at a session of those talks in February, North Korea pledged to shut the Yongbyon reactor and to allow inspectors to verify and monitor the shutdown in return for a 50,000-ton shipment of fuel oil. Mr. Hill said  the atomic energy agency’s inspectors would hold talks with North Korea on verifying the Yongbyon shutdown and sealing the reactor, which would include the installation of television monitors at the site and other technical matters. “Our sense is we will be down to a matter of weeks,” he said. “We are not talking about months.” In the next phase, North Korea would disclose all its nuclear programs and disable all facilities in return for a further 950,000 tons of fuel oil. Mr. Hill said that from a “technical point of view” it would be possible to conclude that part of the agreement by the end of the year.

North Korea will shut down a reactor but only after the U.S. ends sanctions, the U.N. inspector said today.

BEIJING, Mar. 14 —North Koreawill honor its commitment to shut down a reactor it has used to produce fuel for nuclear bombs, but it has demanded that the United States first remove financial penalties against the country, the chief of the United Nations nuclear watchdog said today. Speaking in Beijing after a visit to Pyongyang, Mohamed ElBaradei, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said North Korean officials pledged to adhere to the terms of a Feb. 13 accord that requires, as a first step, that the country shut down its main facility to produce plutonium in exchange for shipments of heavy fuel oil. But Mr. Elbaradei said the officials he met emphasized that they would not act unless the United States resolves a dispute over North Korean deposits at a bank in the Chinese territory of Macau. The deposits, totaling $24 million, have been frozen since the Treasury Department accused the bank of helping North Korea to launder funds used in illicit transactions, including drug running, in 2005. The North Korean officials “mentioned that they are waiting for the lifting of sanctions with regard to the Macau bank,” Mr. ElBaradei said. Referring to the closure of the nuclear facility at Yongbyon, he said, “They said they are ready, willing and capable of doing that as soon as the financial sanctions are lifted.” Mr. ElBaradei’s visit to Pyongyang was the first by an official of the United Nations nuclear agency since 2002, when North Korea expelled nuclear inspectors that had been stationed there under a previous disarmament accord. The United States and North Korea accused each other of violating the accord that year.  North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty shortly thereafter. Under a new disarmament agreement reached in February, the nuclear agency would once again be asked to station inspectors in North Korea to verify that it is rolling back its nuclear weapons program. The scope and timing of such inspections remains to be worked out in future talks, but Mr. ElBaradei said his trip aimed to restore ties between his agency and North Korean officials, and he called his meetings “quite useful.” His visit ended as Christopher Hill, the United States’ assistant secretary of state and the lead United States negotiator at the six-nation talks on the North’s nuclear program, arrived in Beijing for a new round of negotiations about how to implement the Feb. 13 accord. Detailed discussions on various aspects of the accord were expected to continue into next week. The talks are viewed as essential if North Korea is to follow through on its promise to shut down Yongbyon by mid-April. North Korea has insisted for more than a year that it will not move forward with nuclear disarmament unless the United States lifts the threat of sanctions against the Macau bank and allows North Korea access to funds it has deposited there. Last fall, amid a prolonged stalemate in the anti-nuclear talks, Pyongyang conducted its first successful test of an atomic bomb. Mr. Hill and other Bush administration officials initially maintained that the financial measures had no link to the nuclear issue. But administration officials have since said that they are seeking a way to resolve the financial dispute so that the nuclear talks can go forward. Mr. Hill said after his arrival in Beijing that Washington intended to stick by a commitment it made in February to end the Macau dispute promptly. “The Macau issue will be resolved as we’ve promised,” he said. But it remains unclear how quickly North Korea will be able to retrieve all of the funds it deposited with the bank, and some diplomats say they suspect Pyongyang may intend to use the issue to delay implementing the disarmament agreement.

Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice bypassed layers of government policy review that had derailed past efforts to negotiate an agreement.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 — To win approval of a deal withNorth Koreathat has been assailed by conservatives inside and outside the administration, Secretary of StateCondoleezza Ricebypassed layers of government policy review that had derailed past efforts to negotiate an agreement, several senior administration officials said this week. After a meeting in Berlin in mid-January with  her top negotiator on North Korea, Christopher R. Hill,  who had just held lengthy sessions with his North Korean counterparts, Ms. Rice called back to Washington to describe the outlines of the deal to Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser, and then to President Bush. But to some, it seemed the usual procedures were cut short — vetting the details though an interagency process that ordinarily would have brought in Vice President Dick Cheney’s office, the Defense Department and aides at the White House and other agencies who had previously objected to rewarding North Korea before it gives up its weapons. “There was no process here,” said an  official who has been deeply involved in the issue. “Nothing. There was no airing of whether this is the way to deal with the North Koreans.” White House and other administration officials dispute that, saying that all relevant agencies were  consulted. In lieu of the formal meetings where objections to such accords were usually voiced during the president’s first term, Mr. Hadley “walked it through with concerned people,” a  senior administration official said. The official acknowledged that the process was much more informal, and rapid, than usual, although much of Mr. Hill’s work was built upon previous negotiations at the  talks that had been widely vetted across the administration. The result has been an unusual attack on the agreement from the right, starting with John R. Bolton, the former ambassador to the United Nations who takes a tough stance on North Korea issues. He said bluntly that it was a “bad deal,” and expressed the hope that  it would fall apart before being carried out. State Department officials said that Robert Joseph, the under secretary of state for arms control and disarmament, vehemently disagreed with the approach, telling associates privately what Mr. Bolton has said in public: that the new agreement was no better, and perhaps worse, than one signed  by President Clinton in 1994. Mr. Joseph, who announced last month that  he would resign soon, declined to comment Thursday. Ms. Rice on Thursday sternly played down the significance of any internal dissent, making it clear that she would not entertain dissent after the president had made up his mind. “First of all, the U.S. government is the U.S. government,” she said. “And so the decision has been taken. And since people are loyal to decisions that are taken, I think that everybody expects there to be loyalty to this decision.” Mr. Bush, asked at a news conference on Wednesday about Mr. Bolton’s critique, was succinct: “I strongly disagree — strongly disagree with his assessment.” But in Mr. Bush’s first term, the decision-making process worked very differently. State Department negotiators almost never dealt with the North Koreans without officials from the Defense Department and the vice president’s office coming along, and reporting back. In one instance, Mr. Cheney stepped into the Oval Office to put an end to a discussion under way in Beijing, when he feared an agreement setting out steps for resolving the nuclear standoff lacked the tough language on disarmament that he believed Mr. Bush wanted.  Colin L. Powell, then the secretary of state, learned of the decision after a black-tie dinner. In this deal, North Korea has agreed in principle to disarmament, but all discussion about actually giving up weapons — and what the North might receive in return — has been deferred. Senior administration officials said they had been concerned that this deal, unlike the 1994 accord, should not “front-load” benefits to North Korea, and they said that instead it would reward the country bit by bit, as it carried out a freeze, and the “disablement,” of North Korea’s nuclear facilities. “What’s different this time is that it is clear that both the president and Condi wanted a deal,” said an  official  peripherally involved in the debate. Several officials acknowledge that as the Bush presidency enters its final years, two foreign policy goals have risen higher on the agenda:  peace between the Israelis and Palestinians and disarming North Korea. Others said that the rapidly shifting terrain beneath the negotiations allowed Ms. Rice to press her case with Mr. Hadley and directly to the president. Another senior administration official said that the North Korean response to Mr. Hill in Berlin was circulated, but on a “relatively limited” basis as it was one of the most delicate national security issues facing the Bush administration. Immediately after Mr. Hill’s meeting with his North Korean counterpart in Berlin, Mr. Hill briefed Ms. Rice as she stopped in the German capital on the way home from the Middle East. She called the president from Berlin, and also spoke with Mr. Hadley, who was reviewing a copy of the document presented to Mr. Hill by the North Koreans, a senior administration official said. “Chris signed on to it in Berlin,” said a  senior administration official, although a full six-party session was required to formalize the deal because the Bush administration was insisting on a multilateral format to better enforce any agreement with the North.

A showdown was forestalled as North Korea’s news agency said it was “not worth reacting” to South Korean drills on an island the North shelled last month.
==::==

PYONGYANG, North Korea — An ominous showdown between North andSouth Koreawas forestalled Monday after the North withheld military retaliation for South Korea’s live-fire artillery drills on an island that the North shelled last month after similar drills. The North claims the island and its surrounding waters and had threatened “brutal consequences beyond imagination” if the drills went forward. But the North’s official news agency issued a statement Monday night saying it was “not worth reacting” to the exercise, and a statement from the North’s military said, “The world should properly know who is the true champion of peace and who is the real provocateur of a war.” The apparent pullback created a palpable feeling of relief in South Korea, where many people had been bracing for a showdown. Many had expected a repeat — if not worse — of the North’shour-long barrage on Yeonpyeong Island, just eight miles from the North Korean coast, which left two South Korean soldiers and two South Korean civilians dead. Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a former ambassador to the United Nations who spent five days on an unofficial visit toNorth Koreato try to break through the North’s isolation, said the talks had yielded “important progress” on its nuclear program, including a resumption of visits by United Nations monitors. “I believe the North Koreans responded positively because they had pushed themselves into the precipice and into the brink and they had to pull back,” Mr. Richardson said. North Korea’s recent aggressive actions have left it more isolated than ever, he said, “and they need food and fuel and the easing of sanctions.” “Maybe we had a little impact,” he said of the North’s restraint over the drills. After repeated delays attributed to bad weather, the drills began Monday afternoon. The 94 minutes of operations included F-15K fighter-bombers overhead and shelling into waters claimed by both Koreas. About 20 American military personnel took various support and observer roles. The United States has been South Korea’s protector since the Korean War, with 28,500 military personnel stationed in the country. South Korea insisted that the drills were routine and that it had the sovereign right to conduct such exercises, even at a time of heightened tensions. The North has made a series of provocative moves this year: sinking a South Korean warship in March, killing 46 sailors; shelling the island last month; and revealinga new and highly sophisticated nuclear facility. North Korean officials have denied any role in the sinking of the warship. Some North Korea watchers in Seoul said that the sudden softening in tone by the North was most likely part of a broader strategy to nudge both South Korea and the United States to the negotiating table. North Korea, they said, is desperate to obtainfood aidfrom the South and possibly even security guarantees from Washington as the North’s ailing dictator, Kim Jong-il, tries to engineer the succession of his young and untested third son, Kim Jong-un. “North Korea was thinking very strategically when it backed down from its confrontational stance,” said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. “I think they are trying to create the mood for dialogue.” Tony Namkung, a senior advisor to Mr. Richardson and an Asia specialist who accompanied the governor to Pyongyang, said Tuesday:  "This does not add up to a breakthrough or even a turning point. It is a small opening, a reprieve from the current tensions and an opportunity." Mr. Richardson said the United States, South Korea and other nations involved in earlier, failed negotiations over North Korea's nuclear program should exploit  "this potentially new, constructive attitude" in Pyongyang. The South was unwilling to back down over the drills, with President Lee Myung-bak, a conservative, under pressure from his right-wing base for failing to respond more robustly both to last month’s attack and the sinking of the warship. The new South Korean defense minister, a former four-star general, has vowed to strike back hard at North Korea — including airstrikes — should it attack again. Last month’s attack was particularly shocking in the South because it appeared to target the island’s small fishing community of about 1,350 civilians, as well as its military garrison. This led to uncharacteristic calls for revenge against the North. Diplomatic efforts to ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula, and perhaps halt the drills, faltered on Sunday. The United Nations Security Council held a special session, but in six hours of talks failed to agree on a measure calling for moderation and restraint by the two Koreas. Seoul also rejected calls by China and Russia to cancel the exercise. At the Security Council meeting in New York, the American ambassador to the United Nations, Susan E. Rice, defended Seoul, saying it was “important to recognize that there is nothing unusual about these planned drills.” “They are exclusively defensive in nature, and they have been regularly conducted for years,” she said. There had been some concern over the weekend that the South Korean Coast Guard’s detention of three crewmen from a Chinese ship fishing illegally in South Korean waters 170 miles south of Seoul might aggravate relations with China, North Korea’s most important ally, which has sought to defuse the North-South crisis. But both China and South Korea played down the dispute. On Monday, Mr. Richardson detailed the concessions he said the North had made related to its nuclear program, a main source of tension on the peninsula. After meetings with high-ranking military officials, the North Korean vice president and members of the Foreign Ministry, he said, the North agreed to allow United Nations nuclear monitors back into the Yongbyon nuclear complex, the site of its new facility, to ensure that it is not producing enriched uranium for a nuclear bomb. The monitors were expelled last year. North Korean officials also told Mr. Richardson that their government was willing to sell 12,000 plutonium fuel rods to South Korea, removing bomb-making material from the North, he said. “I would describe this as important progress,” he said of the concessions. If allowed access to the Yongbyon complex, monitors could verify how many of the 2,000 centrifuges North Korea says it has installed in the new facility are actually operating. They could measure production and declare whether the country is making reactor-grade or bomb-grade fuel at the complex. But without access beyond Yongbyon, the monitors would not be able to observe any plants that North Korea may be running elsewhere. American and European expertshave all said in recent daysthat they believe that the North must have other production and research facilities; without them, it would have been virtually impossible to assemble so many centrifuges, which enrich uranium, so quickly.

Oh Seung-geun was separated from his family when Communist troops bore down on Pyongyang in 1950. He may finally see his siblings again when some families are reunited on Saturday.

SEOUL,SOUTH KOREA— It was the first week of December, 60 years ago, “with snow up to my bellybutton,” and Communist troops were bearing down on his hometown, Pyongyang. Oh Seung-geun had become separated from the rest of his family — they had caught the last available train to safety with other frightened North Koreans — and now, standing in the deserted railroad station, he was alone. He was a high school kid, just 16, and he thought he would never see his parents or siblings again. Mr. Oh, who now lives in Seoul, knows that his parents have died — they would have been over 100 by now — but he found out only this month that his two sisters were alive inNorth Korea. And his kid brother, the little rascal he taught to swim in the Taedong River in Pyongyang, is also alive. Mr. Oh hopes to see all three of them on Saturday. Mr. Oh, 76, is one of 100 South Koreans selected to meet with long-lost relatives in North Korea as part of the occasional cross-border reunions arranged by the Red Cross. The reunions, as politicized as they are poignant, are to begin Saturday and continue until Nov. 5 at the Diamond Mountain resort. It was Dec. 3, 1950, when Mr. Oh lost track of his family in Pyongyang, and he begged a place on the last troop train out of the city as United Nations forces retreated southward. Three days later, the Communists took control of Pyongyang, the capital of the North. Mr. Oh’s train took him to the southern city of Busan, where he finished high school, joined the air force and in 1960 married a local girl. Fifty years later, they are still married. The trace of a Pyongyang accent is still there in his voice. He still has the trim build of a competitive gymnast — his specialty was the high bar — and his firm handshake is just right, as befits a former air force captain. He had wanted to become a pilot, but northerners were viewed with suspicion in South Korea, especially in the military, so Mr. Oh worked mostly in personnel. Later he moved to Seoul, where he became an executive with the national gas company, ran the professional soccer team that the company sponsored, and then operated a gasoline station for a few years before he retired. He first applied to get on the Red Cross reunion list 15 years ago but heard nothing. “I was afraid I was running out of time,” he said. “People usually die after 80, you know.” But two weeks ago, the Red Cross called: Its computerized lottery system had selected him from tens of thousands of reunion applicants. Since then, he said, he has not been sleeping very well, what with his parents and siblings coming to him so often in his dreams now. Mr. Oh is most eager to see his brother, Oh Seung-sup, who is four years younger. He has not had a scrap of news about him for 60 years, but he is confident he will recognize him immediately. When asked what adjective best described his brother, Mr. Oh said quickly: “Vivacious!” “I think he probably became a soldier, because he was a very active boy,” he said. “I’m sure of it, yes, a soldier.” He barely recalls one sister, Oh Yeon-sik, who was just 4 at the time. The other sister, Oh Yeon-hee, had not been born yet. She is about 60 now. Mr. Oh expects them to arrive at the reunion hungry and underfed, so he and his wife assembled small rolling suitcases packed with white rice, sugar, soaps, aspirin, laxatives, toothpaste and toothbrushes, underwear, long johns and wool socks — the practical items mentioned in guidelines from the South Korean Red Cross. Money, jewelry or any luxury items are discouraged: too easy for the authorities to confiscate. “I imagine they’ll be half-starving,” said Mr. Oh, who planned to wear one of his best suits, maybe the chocolate-brown one. “I guess they’re very poor. We’ve seen other family reunions on TV and the North Korean people wear drab colors, with poor quality material, even in their best clothes.” He said he had heard that the Northerners’ go-to-meeting clothes were usually lent to them by the government — and had to be returned after the reunions. Hundreds of thousands — perhaps millions — of Korean families were separated from 1945 to 1953, the period from the end of World War II to the end of the Korean War. Some family members became accidentally stranded in the confusion of the fighting, like Mr. Oh. Others crossed over on purpose, in search of food, jobs, schooling or lost relatives. Delegations from the rival Koreas first held talks about establishing reunions in 1971, but those meetings went nowhere. The first cross-border reunion was not held until 1985, when only 65 families were rejoined. Then 15 years went by with no reunions, until a landmark summit meeting in Pyongyang in June 2000. Since then, about 21,000 South Koreans have been reunited with Northern relatives, the Red Cross says. Meanwhile, more than 88,000 South Koreans — nearly half of them over 80 — are still waiting for some sort of contact. Many do not even know whether family members in the North are still alive. Even basic communications like phone calls, letters and e-mail are blocked by the two governments. Unless the two Koreas can soon agree to larger and more frequent reunions, most of the separated relatives will die before they see each other again. Bilateral talks failed this week about regularizing the reunions. “It’s a matter of arithmetic at this point,” Mr. Oh said. “At this rate, it will take ages. Do the math. It will take 100 years.” The North-South family reunions are a deeply sensitive issue in South Korea, and even far-right politicians are careful to be seen as supporting them. For its part, the North uses the reunions to pry humanitarian assistance — especially food, fuel and fertilizer — and diplomatic concessions from Seoul and the West. North Korea “does not see reunions as a humanitarian issue,” said Victor D. Cha, a professor at Georgetown University and an adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “They see them as a tool to extract as much aid as they can from the South.” Mr. Oh, who has no fondness for the North Korean regime, is fully aware of the politics. “Oh, yes, this event is very, very political,” he said. “It’s not a humanitarian event at all. Both countries use it for propaganda and political purposes. This is obvious.” According to people who have witnessed past gatherings, there can be scenes of joy, rejection, confusion, even trauma. Fathers fail to recognize sons, mothers spurn daughters, siblings revisit half-century-old grudges. “Everyone has a heartrending story,” said Kim Seong-kuen, the South Korean Red Cross official in charge of the reunions. “They frequently wail in sorrow, and faint,” he said, and a Red Cross medical team and evacuation personnel are always standing by. Family members are not permitted to spend the night with each other — even long-lost husbands and wives — and interactions are limited to a few hours for each of the three days they are together at Diamond Mountain. “By the time you finish crying, it’s over,” Mr. Oh said. Mr. Oh did not know which of his siblings would show up, but he said his very first questions would be about their parents — “how they lived, how they died and where they are buried.” “My biggest hope always was to see my parents again,” Mr. Oh said wistfully, suddenly sounding like a 16-year-old with snow up to his bellybutton. “But I’m sure they’ll be there. Their spirits will be there in the room with us.”

UNITED NATIONS —North Korea’s ambassador to theUnited Nationssaid Tuesday that his country’s military would respond forcefully to any Security Council condemnation over the sinking of a South Korean warship, warning that “our people and army will smash our aggressors.” In a rare news conference, the envoy, Sin Son-ho, called the South Korean investigation carried out with a number of foreign experts, which concluded that a North Korean torpedo blew up the ship, “a complete fabrication from A to Z.” Mr. Sin demanded that a team from his country’s military be allowed to carry out its own investigation on the site where the ship, known as theCheonan, exploded on March 26, killing 46 sailors. “If the Security Council releases any documents against us condemning or questioning us, then myself, as diplomat, I can do nothing,” Mr. Sin said, “but the follow-up measures will be carried out by our military forces.” Mr. Sin, while stating that he was there to clarify, not accuse, said that all the countries involved had ulterior motives that might have played a role in the crisis. The United States used the episode to overcome demands by Japan that it remove its military base from Okinawa, he argued, while the South Korean government sought to foment a crisis atmosphere in the prelude to provincial elections. He also questioned technical details of the investigation at length, calling the fact that a fisherman found the torpedo supposedly carrying North Korean markings after a naval search had yielded nothing something out of “Aesop’s fables.” He repeated statements from his nation’s leaders that the ship might have run aground or exploded because of faulty mechanics. In Washington, the State Department spokesman, Philip J. Crowley, rejected the accusations out of hand. “North Korea unfortunately has put together a string of provocative actions, from missile firings to a nuclear test to the sinking of the Cheonan,” he told reporters. “What is important for North Korea is to take stock of these provocative actions, cease this belligerent behavior, and if they do, we will respond appropriately.” At the United Nations, the United States and Japan were pushing ahead with what is likely to be a resolution condemning the attack, said Security Council diplomats. No member had staunchly opposed the move so far, so Council action could come either this week or next, diplomats said. Each Korea presented its case   to the Council on Monday. Mr. Sin declined to discuss a number of issues, calling them irrelevant to the sinking. These included the possible succession of Kim Jong-un as leader because his father, Kim Jong-il, is ailing; the chances of North Korea’s returning to talks over itsnuclear weaponsprogram; and prospects for the North Korean team in the World Cup. Off topic, the only refrain he repeated was that North Korea’s main goal was to improve the living standard of its people. For the United Nations, the warship issue is more fraught than most in trying to remain neutral, since Ban Ki-moon, the secretary general, is a former South Korean foreign minister and has expressed his own emotional reaction to the attack. In marked contrast to Mr. Ban, who often struggles to express himself in English and can come across as stiff at news conferences, Mr. Sin appeared relaxed, bantering easily with correspondents shouting questions. Although North Korea’s motivations for its actions are often opaque, Mr. Sin gave one remarkably candid answer when asked about the potential fallout from  Security Council condemnation. “I lose my job,” he said.

The widely expected conclusion was bound to escalate tensions between the Koreas and to intensify an international debate on how to punish the North.

SEOUL,South Korea— South Korea formally accusedNorth Koreaon Thursday of responsibility for the sinking of a South Korean warship in March, killing 46 sailors, in one of the deadliest provocations since the two countries ended the Korean War in a truce in 1953. In an uncharacteristicallyswift reaction, North Korea called the South Korean conclusion a “fabrication” and threatened to respond to sanctions with “strong measures, including a full-scale war.” It also offered to send a team of “inspectors” to South Korea to challenge its investigation. South Korea saw “no other plausible explanation” than a North Korean attack. “The evidence points overwhelmingly to the conclusion that the torpedo was fired by a North Korean submarine,” a team of military and civilian investigators from South Korea, the United States, Britain, Australia and Sweden said in a statement. “There is no other plausible explanation.” The widely expected conclusion was bound to escalate tensions between the Koreas and to intensify an international debate on how to punish the North. North Korea, which was also found responsible in 1987 for the bombing of a South Korean commercial jet that killed 115 people, has denied involvement in thesinking on March 26 of the 1,200-ton ship, the Cheonan, which occurred near the countries’ disputed western sea border. North Korea has vowed to retaliate against any attempts to link it to the sinking; it recently threatened to shut down the border, raising the possibility of trapping 1,000 South Korean workers at a joint industrial park in the North Korean city of Kaesong. The South insists that the sinking of its warship deserves punishment — through unilateral and United Nations economic sanctions — because it violates the United Nations charter and the 1953 Korean War armistice. “We will take resolute counter-actions against North Korea. We should make North Korea admit to its wrongdoing through international cooperation,” President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea told Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd by phone, Mr. Lee’s office said. “In the past too, North Korea had denied involvement after committing military provocations and terrorism. But this time, its sophism won’t work because we have evidence no county, no one in the world can dispute.” On Tuesday, the Notational Defense Commission, the North’s highest ruling agency headed by its leader, Kim Jong-il, vowed to retaliate against any attempt to link it to the March 26 sinking of the 1,200-ton ship, the Cheonan, which occurred near the two Koreas’ disputed western sea border. “We will swiftly respond to any punishment, acts of revenge or sanctions that violate our national interest by taking strong measures, including a full-scale war,” the commission said in statement carried in the North’s state-run media. Investigators established a criticalforensiclink when South Korean fishing boats scouring the sea bottom near where the ship went down recovered fragments of a torpedo, including a propulsion motor, propellers and a steering section, Yoon Duk-yong, the head of the investigative team, during a nationally televised news conference on Thursday morning. The parts were on display during the news conference. The fragments matched in size and shape the specifications found in sales pamphlets that North Korea has distributed internationally to export its torpedoes. In one of the parts, the investigators found a handwritten marking in the Korean alphabet Hangul, which reads “No. 1” in English. It was consistent with a similar marking found on a stray North Korean torpedo obtained by the South seven years ago, Mr. Yoon said. After an analysis of intelligence data, the team also concluded that a few small submarines and a mother ship supporting them had left a North Korean naval base two to three days before the South Korean ship was destroyed in an explosion and had returned to port two or three days after the sinking. “Furthermore, we confirmed that all submarines from neighboring countries were either in or near their respective home bases at the time of the incident,” Mr. Yoon said. “The Cheonan was split apart and sunk due to a shock wave and bubble effect produced by an underwater torpedo explosion,” he said, also citing an analysis of damage on the ship’s hull. He said the weapon was a high explosive torpedo “manufactured by North Korea.” One of the North’s ten midget submarines of the 130-ton Yeono class is believed to have approached the Cheonan by sneaking through international waters and torpedoed it at night, said Air Force Brigadier General Hwang Won-dong, a senior investigator. Mr. Hwang said the North has built the Yeono craft mainly for exports. Faced with what it considers the boldest North Korean provocation in years, the government in Seoul has begun rallying international support for sanctions against the North. It invited foreign experts to lend credibility to its investigation. it briefed its neighbors and foreign diplomats in Seoul about the investigation’s findings before formally making them publc. In recent weeks, South Korean officials have dropped widespread hints about North Korean culpability in the attack. They said that if they proved the ship had been struck by a torpedo, people would reasonably conclude that the North was to blame, given its history of military and terrorist provocations against the South. Still, South Korean officials have carefully marshaled their evidence in hopes of securing international support for sanctions. Vital to such an effort would be support from China, a veto-wielding member of the United Nations Security Council and a North Korean ally, which has shored up the regime in Pyongyang. On Tuesday, when South Korea is thought to have briefed the Chinese ambassador in Seoul about its investigation, China’s top envoy in Pyongyang met with North Korean leaders and said that the warm welcome given to the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, when he traveled to Beijing earlier this month was proof of an “undefeatable friendship” between the allies, according to North Korea’s state-run media. China’s stance is likely to drive South Korea into an even closer military alliance with the United States. Officials here have discussed increasing the number of joint United States-South Korean naval exercises in the Yellow Sea, a maneuver designed to guard against the North but certain to irk China. “This attack proves that despite the past decade of international efforts to engage North Korea, nothing has fundamentally changed,” said Ryoo Kihl-jae, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. The two Koreas remain technically at warm because the Korean War ended in 1953 with a truce, but not a permanent peace treaty. South Korea’s previous “Sunshine Policy” of engaging the North with economic aid was altered after Mr. Lee took office two years ago with a vow not to coddle the North until it gives up nuclear weapons. Even before the formal announcement of the investigation’s findings, South Korea has suspended financing for government-level exchanges with North Korea and has asked companies in the South not to start any new deals with the North. But it has shied away from consideration of a military response, which could risk a broader conflict.

A new program brings together teenage South Koreans and North Korean defectors in a rare experiment in building affinity — and preparing for possible reunification.

SEOUL — When Ju Jin-ho arrived here fromNorth Koreain 2006, it was as if he had come to an alien continent, not just the southern end of the peninsula. Even though the 14-year-old defector was placed in a school with children a year or two younger than he, most of his classmates were a head taller. They teased him as a “red.” They were far ahead of him in subjects like mathematics. As desperate as he was to make friends, he had trouble communicating. “During class breaks, they talked about nothing but computer games,” said Mr. Ju, now 17. “I started playing them so I could join their conversations. I became addicted. My eyesight deteriorated. My grades got worse.” Since last summer, however, he’s been enrolled in a new program that seeks to overcome the yawning cultural gap that has developed during the six-decade divide between the Communist North and capitalist South, which have yet to sign a formal peace since the 1950-53 Korean War. It brings together teenage South Koreans and North Korean defectors in a rare experiment here in building affinity — and preparing for possible reunification. Just how far the two sides have drifted apart, how radically different their frames of reference are, was evident when Park Sung-eun, a 16-year-old South Korean, met Mr. Ju last summer through the program in Seoul’s bustling Sinchon district. “When I asked him, ‘How do you get here?’ I expected him to say by bus or subway,” Ms. Park said. Instead, she recalled, “He gave me the whole story of his journey from North Korea through China and Myanmar,” when he fled with his family in 2005. The “Weekend Program for South and North Korean Teenagers Together” was begun last August by the Rev. Benjamin H. Yoon, 80, head of the Citizens’ Alliance for North Korean Human Rights. “Although we share the same genes, South and North Koreans live like completely different peoples, with different accents, different ways of thinking and behaving,” said Mr.  Yoon. “We forgot that before Korea was divided, we lived in the same country, marrying each other.” Under the program, the Citizens’ Alliance, a civic group founded in 1996, has brought together students from Kyunggi Girls’ High School in Seoul with young North Korean defectors for extracurricular activities. They have attended concerts together. They have cooked and compared North and South Korean dishes. The North Koreans, adept at farm work, have shown the South Koreans how to harvest yams and make scarecrows. The Southerners have given the Northerners tips on how to succeed socially as well as academically. They have made friends. One October evening, when the students had gone camping and stayed up late, Moon Sung-il, a 14-year-old North Korean, brought tears to the South Koreans’ eyes when he recounted his two-and-a-half-year flight with other defectors that took him through China, Myanmar and a refugee camp in Bangkok. But he stunned them when he said that none of this was as daunting as a South Korean classroom. “I could hardly understand anything the teacher said,” he said. “My classmates, who were all a year or two younger than I was, taunted me as a ‘poor soup-eater from the North.’ I fought them with my fists.” More than 17,000 North Koreans, one-tenth of them teenagers, have fled to the South since famine hit their homeland in the mid-1990s. The average journey to the South takes 35 months, mostly through China and Southeast Asia. Not all who start make it; some have been caught and returned to the North, where they often end up in labor camps. When they are placed in South Korean schools, these Northerners start nearly from scratch. In the North, they had spent as much time learning about the family of their leader, Kim Jong-il, as they did the rest of Korean history. Few learned English, a requirement in South Korean schools. Dropout rates among defectors are five times the South Korean average, according to the Education Ministry. With the number of North Korean refugees rising about 10 percent annually, how to integrate them has become an early test for possible unification. “Whenever something bad about North Korea came up during class, everyone turned to look at me,” said Mr. Ju, who now attends an alternative school for defectors after failing to advance to a regular high school. “When teachers and students spoke disparagingly about North Korea, I felt like they were insulting me.” Ms. Park said she used to look down on North Koreans. “I associated them with something poor, dark and negative,” she said. Although many successful South Koreans have their roots in the North — the country’s first president, Syngman Rhee; the founder of the Hyundai business empire; the family that built the South’s influential Chosun newspaper; founders of some of the biggest Christian churches — an image has developed of Northerners as second-class Koreans, needy and starving but surly and belligerent. They have takenfood aidfrom the South but threatened it with war, run prison camps and built nuclear weapons. They are friendly toward China but have rejected talks with the South. The mistrust is mutual. In the North, teachers tell children thatSouth Koreais an American colony, a springboard for a future invasion, defectors say. “Back in the North, we seldom heard teachers talk about unification. We seldom thought about it,” said Choi Hyok-chol, a 19-year-old defector. “I still don’t think it’s possible. The two economies are much too different.” In a survey last June of 1,000 South Koreans aged 19 to 59 conducted by the Korea Peace Institute, a Christian research institute, half the respondents said unification was not necessary as long as the two sides lived in peace. In a survey in September of 1,000 people aged 19 to 39, the National Unification Advisory Council for the South Korean president found that 67 percent wanted any unification to be gradual to avoid political and economic chaos. Although a spirit of unification persists in the South, many people balk at what is expected to be the prohibitive cost of integrating the economies. The North’s per capita income amounts to just 6 percent of the South’s, according to the Bank of Korea. “I used to oppose unification because I thought we’d lose more than we’d gain,” said Hur Ji-young, a freshman at Kyunggi. Her friend Lim Hyo-jeong, however, said she supported it because she saw an economic advantage in a larger domestic market. After mingling with the North Korean teenagers for a semester, hearing about their hardships and their concerns for relatives left behind, the South Koreans said they believed more strongly in unification, but now less for economic reasons than something closer to good will. “Before I joined this program, I considered unification with a calculator, not with my heart for fellow Koreans in the North,” Ms. Hur said.

SEOUL,South Korea—North Korearestored regular border crossings for traffic going to South Korean factories in the North on Tuesday, while its leader, Kim Jong-il, reiterated his government’s call for a peace treaty with the United States. North Korea had previously called for talks with Washington to replace the truce — which fell short of a formal treaty — that ended the Korean War in 1953. “We can ease tensions and remove the danger of war on the peninsula when the United States abandons its hostile policy and signs a peace treaty with us,” Mr. Kim said in a commentary carried on Pyongyang Radio, which broadcasts North Korean government statements abroad. The dispatch, which was released late Monday, did not say when Mr. Kim made the statement. But the remark was the latest in a number of recent conciliatory overtures from the North. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, North Korea restored regular  traffic for South Korean companies that have operations in ajoint industrial parkin the North Korean border city of Kaesong. The North had sharply curtailed such traffic in December. The border will now open 23 times a day to traffic to and from Kaesong, up from 6 times, said Lee Jong-joo, a spokeswoman with the Unification Ministry in Seoul. About 110 South Korean factories employ 40,000 North Korean workers at Kaesong. Ian Kelly, a State Department spokesman, said Monday that Washington was “encouraged” by the North’s recent gestures toward the South, but he said he had no comment on the North’s call for a peace treaty. Mr. Kelly urged North Korea to return to six-nation talks with regional powers about the dismantling of itsnuclear weaponsprograms. The North, which prefers a bilateral dialogue with the United States, has said the six-nation framework is dead. Also on Tuesday, a diplomatic delegation left Pyongyang, the North’s capital, for a visit to Beijing, according to KCNA, the official North Korean news agency. China is North Korea’s principal trading partner and its biggest supplier of aid. Washington has said that negotiating a peace treaty with the North is possible only as part of a broader process that addresses the North’s nuclear disarmament. North Koreaconducted its second nuclear test in May, and there is a growing suspicion among analysts in Seoul that the North is trying to win diplomatic recognition from Washington while also being accepted as a nuclear power. The United States led the United Nations forces that fought on South Korea’s behalf during the Korean War and then  signed the truce. North Korea has tried for years to bring  American administrations into peace talks while arguing that it was building nuclear weapons because of Washington’s “hostile policies.”
