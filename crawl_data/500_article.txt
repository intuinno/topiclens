Arms inspections have their uses, but they cannot be a goal in themselves, as we learned in Iraq.

North Korea and Iran get closer and closer to a full-fledged nuclear capability by the day, and as they do,  attention repeatedly turns to inspections as the remedy. Yet, too often, too many have expected too much from such mechanisms. Inspections are not a goal in themselves.  Having served as deputy chairman of UN inspections in Iraq for seven years, I know that arms inspections are no substitute for war or political compromise  —  or good independent intelligence. There is perhaps no better case study for the limits and opportunities provided by monitors than Iraq. Baghdad manipulated the great powers, and infighting among them eventually led to a dramatic and unceremonious end to inspections without any clear knowledge of Baghdad’s WMD program. There are lessons to be learned from this fiasco — North Korea and Iran are equally recalcitrant, dangerous and advancing apace in realizing their nuclear ambitions. Back in 1991, at the conclusion of the first Gulf War, the UN Security Council crafted a cease-fire resolution that continued sanctions on Iraq, and the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) was created to verify Iraqi disarmament. The resolutions accorded UNSCOM sweeping authority, allowing inspectors authority to go virtually anywhere, anytime, without notice; to take any samples and documents; to interview any individual; to bring into the country any material or device deemed necessary. Thus began the most intrusive inspection regime backed by force since the Versailles Treaty imposed similar measures on Germany after World War I. So by 1998 I found myself in Iraq at the center of a circus. I was leading a team of 70 monitors from a dozen countries to “inspect” over 1,000 buildings in eight large presidential areas, considered the most secure of Iraqi sites, access to which had been completely denied in the past. Per an agreement between Saddam Hussein and Kofi Annan, the increased oversight would hopefully lead to the end of this intrusive inspections regime. But alas, this was not exactly to be. We traveled from one palace area to another in a huge Slinky-like convoy of over 70 vehicles, and, at every location, we found the Iraqis had meticulously cleansed each building. There was not a scrap of paper anywhere. Computers had vanished. Because of these infractions, monitors demanded short-notice, anytime, anywhere inspections essentially ad infinitum. They were unwilling to sign off on Iraqi compliance as “good enough.” But Annan and some members of the Security Council believed inspectors were seeking to do too much. The French wondered whether we were being too fastidious. Was sorting out the remaining uncertainties really worth the cost of sanctions? Making matters worse, Iraq eroded any remaining unity among Security Council members by offering economic incentives to those who aided its case for ending sanctions. Russia and France were given preferential treatment in the allocation of lucrative Iraqi oil contracts under the UN oil-for-food program. Baghdad was also dangling rich oil-field-development rights in front of the noses of Security Council countries. But Washington had no interest in ending sanctions, which were the only tool short of war the U.S. had to contain Saddam. What this meant in the end was a lack of unity and credibility on maintaining the sanctions regime or even ratcheting up to war by the Security Council. These divisions were the death knell for inspections in Iraq. In some ways the cases of North Korea and Iran are eerily similar. Both countries are single, dedicated, unitary actors opposed in their WMD activities by a coalition of varying unity, commitment and purpose. Each has sought to sow dissension among the nations that want to deter its programs. Neither Pyongyang nor Tehran will ever agree to the level of intrusive inspections that happened in Baghdad. Barring difficult-to-imagine military invasions of either state, we will have to settle for less. Yet this is clearly better than nothing. First, the case of North Korea. It is impossible to know what Kim Jong-Il will decide with respect to future negotiations or the possible return of inspectors. He  is not overly vulnerable to  sanctions. Like Iraq, North Korea is driven by a tyrant and calculations about policy are deeply affected by how long that ruler may last and what may follow. Here, though, we have some advantages that we did not have in  Iraqi. Saddam gave no signs of weakening and seemed likely to survive longer than any U.S. administration. Kim Jong-Il looks to be fading. What we need now is to buy time. North Korea has demonstrated the ability to produce fissile material and nuclear explosions, though this does not yet indicate an ability to build a deliverable nuclear weapon — especially via  ballistic missile. But it is clearly North Korea’s goal. Unchecked, Pyongyang can, over the period of a few years, develop and test nuclear warheads deliverable on missiles. In the nearer term, such missiles can threaten the cities of neighboring Japan, South Korea or China. In the longer term, North Korea may be able to launch a longer-range missile with sufficient payload to carry a weapon to the United States. So the primary goal is to contain or walk back Pyongyang’s  nuclear capability and, perhaps even more importantly, guard against the transfer of weapons or fissile material to other state or non-state actors. Sampling and interviews by inspectors can serve as “tippers” of possible violations. In this way, sampling provides a useful deterrent, and is the most potent element of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  inspection tool kit for detecting nondeclared nuclear activities. The inspected party cannot know with confidence how well these sampling procedures work. UNSCOM, for example, deployed air samplers to detect prohibited chemical work at some locations in Iraq. They did not really work at all, yet Baghdad treated them as if they did. Sampling at a few locations at least constrains cheating at those sites, and sampling at nondeclared sites (even if conducted with prior notice) can create a deterrent effect throughout the entire country. Interviews can also have a powerful effect. Generally, they make it difficult for an inspected country to sustain deception. UNSCOM experts over the years came to know the Iraqi experts and their work quite well. Over time, as more questions are posed and more and more details provided, the difficulty of staying consistent with a false story increases exponentially. If we couple sampling techniques with interviews, weapons inspections may well be a sufficient tool (when combined with appropriate political incentives and disincentives) to restrain North Korea’s programs. In the case of Tehran, we are looking less at how to bide our time than how to provide trip wires. Iran can build a nuclear weapon. The questions are when and whether it will decide to do so. Weapons inspectors can perform an alert function. It would be safe to assume that Iran’s intention is to get to a point where the lead time between a decision to build a nuclear weapon and the means to effectively deliver one is relatively short. There are three key factors here: the length of time to go from low-enriched uranium produced for civilian reactors to the highly enriched uranium required for a weapon; the ballistic-missile technology required to make a long-range weapon; and the creation of a nuclear warhead to place atop the ballistic missile. While limited, the current IAEA inspection activities do provide some important bounds on uncertainty. If Iran decides to produce highly enriched uranium, the monitoring procedures will force Tehran to either build separate clandestine enrichment facilities or break inspection procedures in a way that provides clear evidence of intent to proceed beyond its purely civil nuclear program. What is lacking in the current inspection procedure is the ability to detect clandestine enrichment or the kind of weaponization activity that would help produce a functioning ballistic missile with a nuclear warhead. It is improbable that Iran will accept an inspection regime that would make this possible. And lest we forget, the invasive inspections in Iraq couldn’t even tell us everything. We will likely remain in an ambiguous, prolonged diplomatic process with Tehran that will wind up with an “assumed” ability of Iran to go nuclear at a point in the future — the so-called virtual-nuclear-weapons state. Indeed, United Nations inspectors may have lots of rights written by ambassadors between their long lunches in New York, but on the ground in Iraq and elsewhere, outside some of the most heavily guarded facilities on the planet, these inspectors have only blue hats, cameras and pencils. The other guys have guns, and they determine the real limits of inspection activities. From the experience in Iraq, we have seen the ability of the international community to hide behind inspectors in some circumstances and to expect too much from them in others. As we attend to the evolving problems with proliferation in North Korea, Iran and the states to follow, watch out for those trying to place too much responsibility on inspections and inspectors.

As the Security Council once again votes on a new round of sanctions, the question is whether there are real pressure points that North Korea will respond to.

SEOUL, South Korea — North Korean threats and weapons tests followed by American-led sanctions and short-lived deals have become an all-too-familiar pattern in the world’s response toNorth Korea’s nuclear program. With the Security Council havingapproved a new round of sanctions, the question is whether there are real pressure points that even the hermetic North Korean government will respond to or is this all just window dressing? In the newest round of sanctions afterNorth Korea’s second nuclear test on May 25, the United States and allies like Japan and South Korea have brought back measures, such as freezing the North’s overseas bank accounts, that seemed most painful to the government in the past. Diplomats call the new sanctions, which also include high-seas searches of North Korean ships for unconventional weapons, potentially some of the most potent  yet aimed atNorth Korea. But Russia and China resisted calls to make them mandatory, so it remains unclear how great an impact they will have. But mandatory or not, many analysts and former diplomats questioned whether any sanctions regime would ever have enough bite to break the cycle. “Sanctions won’t bring North Korea to its knees,” said Kim Keun-sik, a specialist on North Korea at  Kyungnam University in Seoul. “The North knows this very well, from having lived with economic sanctions of one sort or another for the past 60 years.” Most analysts agree that the most effective measures are those that target the lifestyle of North Korean leaders: financial sanctions aimed at ending all banking transactions related to North Korea’s weapons trade, and halting most grants and loans. This would effectively freeze many of the North’s overseas bank accounts, cutting off the funds that North Korean leaderKim Jong-ilhas used to secure the cognac, Swiss watches and other luxury items needed to buy the loyalty of his country’s elites. The United States has also accused the North of using such offshore accounts to launder counterfeited dollars and for narcotics trafficking, criminal activities that the Treasury Department estimates earn the government as much as $700 million annually in hard currency. A similar tactic was tried in 2005, when $25 million in North Korean accounts was frozen at Banco Delta Asia, an obscure institution in the Chinese territory of Macao. To the surprise of many at the time, the measure brought howls of protest from North Korea. “The sanctions against B.D.A. hit the regime where it hurts,” said Lee Sang-hyun, a North Korea specialist at theSejong Institute, a private research institute, using the bank’s abbreviation. However, some analysts and former officials here blame the financial sanctions for having the opposite effect, provoking the North and hardening its resolve. Some link the B.D.A. sanctions to the North’s first nuclear test, which came just a year later, in October 2006. “The sanctions against B.D.A. hurt, but in the end did they work? No, the North responded by just spitting in America’s face with the nuclear test,” said Jeong Se-hyun, who as unification minister was one of the South’s top negotiators with North Korea during the administrations of former presidents Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun, who were often at odds with Washington over pressure on North Korea. This time, in addition to financial sanctions, the proposed Security Council resolution calls for a tighter arms embargo, possible interdiction of North Korean vessels. But most analysts say that none of the threats are large enough to stop a government that seesnuclear weaponsas the key to its survival, and that has endured decades of economic sanctions and hardships, including even starvation, rather than capitulate to outside pressure. “These are people who didn’t flinch even when 2 million of their own people died of hunger,” said Lee Ji-sue, a North Korea specialist at Myongji University. And that is assuming that the sanctions are fully enforced. While many of these same measures have been included in previous United Nations resolutions, nations like China and Russia were reluctant to enforce them to avoid antagonizing the North. Critics and proponents alike agree that the linchpin in making any sanctions work is China, North Korea’s primary aid and trade partner. China shares an 850-mile border with North Korea, and its $2 billion annual trade with the North accounts for over 40 percent of North Korea’s entire external trade, according to South Korean government estimates. North Korea’s trade with China expanded by 23 percent just last year, the South Korean government said. Both United States and South Korean officials fear that although Beijing was disappointed by the North’s continued tests, it remains reluctant to push too hard. They say China fears causing a collapse of the North Korean government that could flood it with refugees and create a newly unified, pro-American Korea on its border. It remains to be seen whether Beijing or even Washington would have the stomach to enforce some of the proposed sanctions, such as interdicting North Korean ships. North Korea has proclaimed that it would regard any such search as an act of war. “The sanctions will have a bite, but I’m not sure if it will be painful enough to change North Korean policy,” said Wi Sung-lac, the Foreign Ministry’s top negotiator with North Korea. “What we need on top of the sanctions is a united approach by the key players to enforce them.” In the end, what is needed to convince the North to give up its nuclear weapons, say many analysts and diplomats, is a “grand bargain” of sweeping incentives that could include large-scale economic aid, normalization of relations with the United States and pledges that Washington will not attack or topple the North Korean government. “We need big enough carrots to go along with a stronger stick,” said Yun Duk-min, a North Korea specialist at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security, a government research institute. “That is the only hope for breaking out of this cycle.”

Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates’s trip to Asia highlighted the looming problems with North Korea.
==::==

==::==
ANCHORAGE — Defense SecretaryRobert M. Gatesruns the most powerful military in the world, but his six-day trip to Asia and Alaska this past week proved how much remains out of his control. Not only did he have to respond to the unpredictable nuclear theatrics ofNorth Korea— a country senior Defense Department officials routinely describe as not of this planet — but he also was grounded by days of repairs to his plane, which  is built to  withstand a nuclear blast but not, it turns out, a broken wing flap. From the top of a hotel crammed with Asian generals in a steamy Singapore to the bottom of a missile silo insub-Arctic Alaska, Mr. Gates took a tough line in public on North Korea and a tough line in private on the Air Force, which provides the maintenance crew for his plane. In both cases, senior defense officials said it was hard to know what was actually going on. North Korea, of course, presented the greater strategic implications. Its nuclear test on May 25, days before the major security conference that Mr. Gates attended in Singapore, woke up the clutch of defense intellectuals and, for the most part, hardened views toward the regime. American officials said that countries at the conference, called the Shangri-La Dialogue, remained divided over whether North Korea was determined to develop nuclear weapons at any cost or could still be enticed to give them up. Mr. Gates, for one, signaled that the Obama administration had lost patience with the six-party talks aimed at persuading North Korea to abandon its nuclear dreams. “Everyone in the room is familiar with the tactics that the North Koreans use,” he said with disdain in a question-and-answer session after formal remarks on Saturday. “They create a crisis, and then the rest of us pay a price to return to the status quo ante. As the expression goes in the United States, I’m tired of buying the same horse twice.” At the same time, Pentagon officials admitted that they were largely in the dark about North Korea. “I am constantly amazed by how little we know about what’s going on in the North,” a senior Defense Department official said, acknowledging the difficult road ahead. “If they are really totally crazy, how do you form a policy around that?” he said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Gates’s plane troubles were only slightly less mysterious. The problems began last Wednesday when a maintenance crew discovered that Mr. Gates’s specially fitted 747, which had flown from Washington to Wichita, Kan., to pick him up after he delivered the commencement address at his alma mater, Wichita East High School, had developed a flap problem that prevented refueling in midair, a major timesaver. After five hours on the ground in Wichita, the problem was still not solved and the plane took off on a World War II-era island hop across the Pacific to Singapore, with refueling stops in Hawaii and Guam. Mr. Gates’s planned 20-hour flight grew to 28 hours, forcing him to arrive too late for most of his Friday meetings. The aircraft, which is nicknamed the Doomsday Plane because it contains an airborne command center that can be used during an attack on the United States, was still under repair in Singapore on Sunday when the maintenance crew discovered a new hydraulic problem. Mr. Gates was grounded, he had planned to head that night to the Philippines and he was forced to truncate his schedule the next day in Manila. His staff described him as highly irritated by the Air Force, which as it happens has been angry about the defense secretary’s proposed cuts to the F-22 fighter jet program. By Monday, the plane was fixed and Mr. Gates made it to Manila and then Alaska. “Given the maintenance problems on my plane the last week, I’m really happy to be here with you today,” he told the crowd at Elmendorf Air Force Base outside Anchorage. “I’m confident that there was absolutely no connection between those maintenance problems and my decisions on the Air Force budget.” Mr. Gates next headed north in Alaska on a military transport plane to Fort Greely. There, with an eye toward North Korea — and critics of his proposed cuts to missile defense in Congress — he descended into an underground silo, inspecting an interceptor missile that would theoretically stop an incoming warhead from North Korea and declaring that Americans were safe. What did he think of the interceptor up close? “Forty years ago I was a lieutenant at an Air Force base that had Minuteman missiles,” replied Mr. Gates, who was in the last event on the last day of a very long trip. “And, you know, a missile looks like a missile. You just make sure the pointy end is up.”

FORT GREELY, Alaska — Defense SecretaryRobert M. Gatesdescended into an underground silo in this sub-Arctic outpost on Monday to deliver the message toNorth Korea— and his critics in Congress — that the United States had plenty of interceptors to shoot down an enemy missile should the North launch an attack. “We have a good capability here,” Mr. Gates said after clambering down the stairs of the silo to view one of 16 interceptor missiles designed to stop a North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile before it reaches, theoretically, San Francisco or Hawaii. “Knowing that we have this capability and that it becomes more effective each passing day should be a source of comfort to the American people in an uncertain world.” The defense secretary, who is not normally a theatrical man, engaged in the showmanship in an attempt to soothe those in Congress who have complained that his proposed $1.2 billion worth of cuts in the missile defense budget are risky at a time when North Korea has just tested another nuclear device and continues to launch missiles. In Mr. Gates’s proposed budget, plans for 44 interceptors here in Alaska and at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California would be reduced to 30, which Mr. Gates maintains is adequate for now. “It’s not a forever decision,” Mr. Gates said. “And if capabilities in one of these rogue states should develop faster, or in a more worrisome way than anybody anticipates right now, then I think the way is open in the future to add to the number of silos and interceptors up here.” Mr. Gates, who has sought a middle ground between critics of the cuts and those who say the threat from Pyongyang is hyped and that he has not cut nearly enough, said the North Korean test had had the temporary effect of muffling skeptics of missile defense over all. “I haven’t heard much out of those folks lately,” Mr. Gates said. Earlier in the day, during a four-hour stop in the Philippines, Mr. Gates said that North Korea might  be preparing to launch another long-range missile that would be theoretically able to  reach Alaska and Hawaii as well as American military targets in Japan and Guam. “We have seen some signs that they may be doing something with another Taepodong-2 missile, but at this point it’s not clear what they’re going to do,” Mr. Gates said, referring to North Korea’s intercontinental ballistic missile. He made his remarks during a joint news conference in Manila with Gilberto C. Teodoro Jr., the Philippine secretary of national defense. Over the weekend, an American official confirmed South Korean news reports of indications that the North was preparing to ship an intercontinental ballistic missile toward a testing site on the Sea of Japan, a sign that the reclusive government of Kim Jong-il may be planning another launching. Monday was the first time that the defense secretary acknowledged the possibility publicly. Mr. Gates stopped in the Philippines en route to Alaska from Singapore, where he had spent three days at a regional defense conference. During the conference, Mr. Gates raised the idea in a meeting with the defense ministers of Japan and South Korea to take a tougher approach toward the North, including the prospect of building up American defenses in the region should continuing six-nation diplomatic talks with North Korea fail.

North Korea said it had successfully conducted its second nuclear test, raising the stakes in the effort to get the nation to give up its nuclear weapons program.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreaannounced on Monday that it had successfully conducted its second nuclear test, defying international warnings and dramatically  raising the stakes in a global effort to get the recalcitrant Communist state to give up itsnuclear weaponsprogram. The North’s official news agency, KCNA, said, “The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea successfully conducted one more underground nuclear test on May 25 as part of the measures to bolster up its nuclear deterrent for self-defense in every way as requested by its scientists and technicians.” The test was safely conducted “on a new higher level in terms of its explosive power and technology of its control,” the agency said. “The results of the test helped satisfactorily settle the scientific and technological problems arising in further increasing the power of nuclear weapons and steadily developing nuclear technology.” The test clearly caught South Korea and the United States off guard, and the news hit just as South Korea’s government and people were mourning the suicide of former President Roh Moo-hyun. And hours after the test was reported, South Korean media reported that the North had fired a short-range missile. The nuclear test comes against a backdrop of uncertainty about North Korea’s reclusive leader, Kim Jong-il, and increased speculation about who might succeed him. Mr. Kim suffered a stroke last August, which prompted him to step up preparations to transfer power to one of his three known sons. Analysts believe the favorite son is his youngest, Kim Jong-un, who is in his mid-20s. North Korea conducted its first nuclear test on Oct. 9, 2006, which was considered something of a bust by South Korean and American officials. North Korea had given some advance notice before that test, which, like Monday’s test, also was conducted in the country’s northeast. Pyongyang had recently threatened to conduct a second nuclear test, citing what it called Washington’s “hostilities.” If the North’s latest test was more of a success, it could mean that North Korea has bolstered its atomic weapons capabilities — and its leverage over the United States, which has sought to  denuclearize the North. In Washington, the Obama administration had a cautious initial reaction to the news early Monday. “We are aware of the reports of a nuclear test by North Korea,” said a senior State Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the department was still gathering information. “We are consulting with our allies. Once we have established the facts, we will have more to say.” There was no immediate reaction to the test from the Chinese foreign ministry, but China’s official news agency, Xinhua, cited concern by officials in Japan, Russia and the European Union.  Japan was expected to call for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, Xinhau said. Hints that the North had conducted a new test first emerged Monday morning when South Korean authorities detected an artificially triggered tremor emanating from the area of Kilju, in northeastern North Korea, said Lee Dong-kwan, spokesman of the office of President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea. The spokesman said “intelligence officials of South Korea and the United States are analyzing the data and closely monitoring the situation.” Earlier Monday, North Korea announced that Kim Jong-il had sent a message expressing “profound condolences” to the widow of Mr. Roh, who had pursued a more conciliatory policy toward the North. It remained unclear whether Mr. Kim would send a delegation to Mr. Roh’s funeral slated for Friday. Relations between the Koreas have deteriorated since Mr. Roh’s successor, Mr. Lee, took office in February 2008, promising to reverse the “sunshine policy” of promoting political reconciliation with Pyongyang with economic aid. Agreements resulting from a 2007 summit meeting called for the South to spend billions of dollars to help rebuild the impoverished North’s dilapidated infrastructure. Mr. Lee believed that such aid must be linked to improvements in the North’s human rights record and the dismantling of its nuclear facilities. North Korea has viciously attacked Mr. Lee, calling him a “national traitor,” cutting off official dialogue and reducing traffic across the countries’ heavily armed border. The new test comes against a backdrop of heightened tensions between North Korea and the United States, which keeps a heavy military deployment in South Korea. Two American journalists are scheduled to be tried June 4 in North Korea, charged with illegal entry into the North and “hostile acts,” and that case in particular has aggravated tensions between Pyongyang and Washington. The relationship was already strained by the North’s launching of a long-range rocket on April 5. After that launch, Washington pressed the United Nations Security Council to tighten sanctions on the North. In retaliation, Pyongyang expelled United Nations nuclear monitors, while threatening to restart a plant that makes weapons-grade plutonium and to conduct a nuclear test. This month, one day after an American diplomat offered new talks onNorth Korea’s nuclear program, the North said it had become useless to talk further with the United States. “The study of the policy pursued by the Obama administration for the past 100 days since its emergence made it clear that the U.S. hostile policy toward the D.P.R.K. remains unchanged,” the North Korean Foreign Ministry said, using the initials for the country’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. In comments carried by KCNA, the ministry said: “There is nothing to be gained by sitting down together with a party that continues to view us with hostility.” The rebuff came as Stephen W. Bosworth, the American special envoy on North Korea, began a trip to Asia with a fresh offer of dialogue. The North’s vow to “bolster its nuclear deterrent” came just hours before Mr. Bosworth was due to arrive in Seoul. The North’s first nuclear test in 2006 was widely condemned, but it created a new urgency in the six-party talks that had failed to prevent the blast. The parties to the talks are the two Koreas, the United States, China, Japan and Russia. In February 2007, Washington agreed to ease sanctions against banks dealing with Pyongyang, and North Korea concurrently agreed to a process that would lead to the dismantling of its nuclear weapons program. North Korea would receive deliveries of fuel oil in exchange for certain verifications that it was ending its program. But last December the process collapsed when North Korea rejected the verification measures being sought by the Bush administration.

Pyongyang&#8217;s leaders believe that by pushing missile-launch buttons they can extract aid from the U.S. Maybe it&#8217;s time to show them they are wrong.

SEOUL — Recent weeks have been full of dramatic events on the Korean Peninsula. On April 6, North Korea, in spite of warnings from the United Nations and major states, launched a rocket (or, perhaps, a prototype intercontinental missile). Soon afterwards, it withdrew from the six-party talks on denuclearization, expelled foreign inspectors from its nuclear facilities, and asserted that it would soon start reprocessing plutonium. Finally, Pyongyang officials said that the country is preparing for a nuclear test. These actions are above all a show put on for  Washington. Pyongyang is afraid that the Obama administration,  distracted by the economy and  the Middle East, will not pay enough attention to North Korea. This would be bad news for the Pyongyang regime,  which has survived the last two decades through skillful, ruthless diplomacy aimed at maximizing unconditional foreign aid. Pyongyang  needs the United States, both as a generous donor and also as a counterweight to  China’s growing power. Pyongyang’s leaders know that  to be taken seriously, they should appear dangerous, irrational and unpredictable. So, they are trying hard. The North’s diplomats also know from  experience that blackmail usually works. From 2002 to 2006, the Bush administration followed a hard-line approach. In October 2006, the North conducted a nuclear test, and in merely four months, the United States switched to a soft line, restarted negotiations and resumed aid to the North. The decision to return to the engagement was, probably, a wise one, but its timing sent a dangerous signal to the North Koreans. They saw  —  once again  —  that their provocations are handsomely rewarded. Upon learning about the change in U.S. policy, a senior Russian diplomat remarked: “Well, from now on the North Koreans will know what to do when they again run out of money.” It seems that the North Koreans now need  money. The missile launch last month was a reminder to President Obama that U.S. checks should be in the mail. Official statements from Pyongyang even hinted at the initial price the world (and above all the United States) is expected to pay if it wants Pyongyang to behave for a while. The statements specifically mentioned the light water reactors whose construction  —   agreed upon after a blackmail campaign of 1994  —  was halted by the Bush administration. The North Koreans now say they will build those reactors themselves  —  even though this is plainly impossible due to costs and technical problems. They  seem to be saying: This is what we want from you if you do not want missiles flying and nuclear devices exploding. North Korean leaders are also frank about the likely consequences of a delay in payments: They have stated that if the U.N. Security Council does not revoke sanctions against North Korea and apologize  for introducing them, Pyongyang will have to conduct another nuclear test. Clearly, this is what’s going to happen  —  after a few months of tension-building carefully arranged by Pyongyang. However, President Obama’s  initial  reaction seems to indicate  that he  may be willing to call  North Korea’s bluff. This is an advisable approach. In the long run there is no alternative to negotiations and engagement with North Korea, but the  North’s periodic  outbursts are becoming too dangerous. It’s  time to disappoint Pyongyang officials, who have come to believe that provocation is the best way to squeeze concessions from the outside world. Nuclear tests by the North are a certainty, but what will happen if no U.S. envoy rushes to Pyongyang with a broad smile and big check? The North Koreans might just back off. It is equally possible that they will try to raise tensions even further, either by launching more missiles or by doing something innovative  —  like, say,  making a “top secret” nuclear proliferation deal with some rogue state,  followed by carefully arranged leaks to the media. Will the Obama administration be able to stay calm? Or will Washington blink and  deliver what Pyongyang wants, just to temporarily placate Kim Jong-il’s clique?  This is open to question, but  recent developments give reasons for cautious optimism. This does not mean that no talks should be conducted  —   negotiations are the only way to keep Pyongyang under some control while gradually changing the country. However talks (and, unavoidably, concessions and payments) need not  become instant rewards for outrageous provocation.  Pyongyang’s leaders believe that by pushing missile-launch buttons they can switch on the U.S. aid machine. Maybe it’s time to show them they are wrong.

The move left the country on the verge of restarting a nuclear weapons program whose shutdown was portrayed as a significant diplomatic achievement.

WASHINGTON —North Korea’s move to resume the reprocessing of plutonium, perhaps as soon as next week, left the country on the verge of restarting a nuclear weapons program whose shutdown had been portrayed by the White House as a significant diplomatic achievement. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Wednesday that the United States still hoped to preserve a hard-won agreement that called for the North to dismantle its nuclear reactor. But North Korea has refused to resume talks, and no new ones are planned. TheInternational Atomic Energy Agencyin Vienna announced Wednesday that North Korea had barred international inspectors from a reprocessing plant at its nuclear reactor complex in Yongbyon. The agency said that North Korea, which tested its first nuclear device in 2006 and is believed to have enough plutonium for at least six nuclear bombs, intended to resume production of nuclear weapons-grade fuel there within a week. While reversible in theory, any resumption of nuclear work would violate the terms of the agreement, which was announced with fanfare in June and solidified, it appeared, by North Korea’s public demolition of a cooling tower at Yongbyon. North Korea’s actions have at best returned negotiations to where they stood months ago, leaving little time for a resolution before the next American administration takes office in January. Senior Bush administration officials said Wednesday that they believed that North Korea was engaging in transparent brinkmanship to extract concessions as the United States sought to cement the country’s commitment to give up its nuclear weapons with a strict and intrusive verification system. “They don’t have a lot of ways to get leverage, and this is one of them,” one Bush administration official who was involved in the negotiations said of North Korea’s move. The official, like others interviewed for this article, spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss diplomatic efforts and internal administration assessments. North Korea’s actions are likely to provide fodder to conservative critics of the administration, who say that North Korea has no intention of giving up its nuclear program and that it is blackmailing the United States and its negotiating partners to subsidize North Korea’s failing economy. But its elaborately choreographed violation of the agreement in publicly announced steps over the past few weeks could also be part of a tough negotiating stance that North Korea feels is necessary to obtain the security guarantees and financial aid the country was promised as part of the nuclear accord. North Korea’s negotiators have strenuously complained that the Bush administration has yet to fulfill its promise to remove North Korea from a list of state sponsors of terrorism, as President Bush announced in June that he was prepared to do, and instead has made new demands. Those include requiring North Korea to accept the verification system before the United States would carry out reciprocal steps, a condition that a senior administration official acknowledged was not put in writing. “It is, I think, more serious than just brinkmanship on the part of the North Koreans,” said Charles L. Pritchard, a former ambassador and special envoy for talks with North Korea who is now president of the Korean Economic Institute in Washington. “They’re trying to recoup what they’ve given away for nothing, from their point of view.” If North Korea follows through, it would be the second time the country resumed production of the material for nuclear weapons during President Bush’s time in office. In acting now, when the White House is already consumed with a financial crisis, North Korea may be adopting a strategy similar to one it employed at the beginning of 2003, when it restarted its nuclear program just as the United States was preparing to invade Iraq. Complicating the matter is uncertainty over the health of North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-il, who administration officials said Wednesday had a stroke last month that debilitated him physically and possibly mentally. That has raised concerns that hard-liners may be acting forcefully to demonstrate that North Korea faces no leadership crisis during Mr. Kim’s illness. American and European officials, trying to assess the seriousness of the North Korean intentions, noted that so far, experts who have been overseeing the dismantling of North Korea’s nuclear program, including some Americans, had not yet been expelled from the country. “We don’t see the tensions on the ground,” the senior administration official said. The reprocessing plant, which turns spent nuclear fuel rods into weapons-grade plutonium, is the most secret part of the Yongbyon nuclear complex. Its reactivation would be significant, even though the main reactor has been partly dismantled under the agreement. Moreover, allowing international inspectors to monitor activity at the plant was one of the most significant concessions the North made as part of the agreement on ending its program. If inspectors remain barred from the plant, it will become far more difficult to keep track of how much nuclear fuel the North produces. “There are no more seals and surveillance equipment in place at the reprocessing facility,” Melissa Fleming, a spokeswoman for the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in Vienna. Arms control experts say that if the plant is in good repair, it will take little time to restart the plutonium-making process, and that making pure plutonium from spent fuel rods once the process starts could be only weeks away. It would take two to three years, by contrast, for North Korea to produce extractable new plutonium if it restarted its reactor. The Bush administration immediately warned North Korea not to reactivate the plant, while urging it to resume negotiations on ways to verify its lengthy declaration of its nuclear activities over many years. Ms. Rice, in New York for the United Nations General Assembly session, said a decision by North Korea to resume reprocessing nuclear material “would only deepen its isolation.” She has met with the foreign ministers of China, South Korea and Russia, all parties to the negotiations with the North Koreans. “Everyone knows what the path ahead is,” she said. “The path ahead is for there to be agreement on a verification protocol so that we can continue along the path of the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” She did not elaborate on what additional steps the administration would take. So far at least, officials said, it has not decided to retaliate by, for example, suspending shipments of heavy fuel oil that China, Russia, South Korea and the United States have been making under the agreement. The next American shipment is not due until October. Its fate could depend on whether the North Koreans move ahead. The impasse over the verification of North Korea’s denuclearization reflected deep suspicions on both sides. Mr. Bush has been criticized by some conservatives who say that the initial accord was not vigorous enough in verifying the North’s nuclear activities, including what officials say is a separate and still secret uranium program and evidence of the transfer of nuclear technology to other countries, specifically Syria. “We’re still not convinced they have given us a true picture of what they may or may not have done,” the senior administration official said Wednesday, underscoring, he said, the need for a vigorous protocol for future inspections. The official involved in the negotiations said that the United States had presented a draft of its verification proposals to the North Koreans in August and that it included “the max.” “We put the most we could on paper, anticipating they would bargain,” the official said. Derek J. Mitchell, a former Defense Department official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said that the American insistence on extracting a verification system was justified and probably difficult for Mr. Bush and his most hawkish aides to accept otherwise. “I’m not sure any action can be taken, or is politically viable, without a demonstration of North Korean good faith,” he said. At the same time, though, Mr. Mitchell noted that the United States had so far not conceded much, undercutting the process. While Mr. Bush gave Congress 45 days notice that he intended to remove North Korea from a list of terrorist sponsors, he did not take that step before that window closed on Aug. 11. Also, he lifted sanctions under the Trading With the Enemy Act but imposed new ones under a little publicized emergency declaration he issued the same day in June. “We haven’t given up much yet,” Mr. Mitchell said, adding that he, like others, assumed that there was little chance for an agreement during the final months of this administration. “Meanwhile, they have frozen their program. It is step by step, action for action. We can’t cut corners.”

A draft agreement on dismantling North Korea’s nuclear program is expected to be made public after a two-day recess in talks.

BEIJING, Sept. 30 — Talks on dismantlingNorth Korea’s nuclear program broke  Sunday for a two-day recess so delegates could consult their governments on a draft plan and timetable to disable the North’s nuclear facilities. The draft agreed to after four days of six-nation talks here was expected to be made public after the recess, negotiators said without revealing further details. “Assuming we go forward with this, it really lays out an entire road map through the end of the year,” the chief American negotiator to the talks,  Christopher R. Hill, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, said before leaving for Washington, according to Reuters.  “Frankly, of all the six-party meetings, this was the least stressful in terms of coming up with common positions.” He added that the talks were “really into the nuts and bolts now of implementing denuclearization.” The prospect of progress in the disarmament talks comes as the leaders of North and South Korea prepare for a three-day summit meeting beginning Tuesday in Pyongyang, the North’s capital, only the second such meeting between the  states since the Korean Peninsula was divided in 1945. The six-nation talks bring North Korea, China, the United States, Japan, South Korea and Russia together with the aim of eliminating the threat from nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula. North Korea tested a nuclear weapon last October. Under an agreement reached in February after four years of talks, the North pledged to shut its  plutonium producing reactor at Yongbyon and allow international inspectors to verify the shutdown in return for 50,000 metric tons of fuel oil. The reactor was shut  in July, and the North has begun to receive fuel shipments. The talks now under way in Beijing are aimed at carrying out the second part of the February deal that calls for the North to disclose all its nuclear programs and disable all facilities in return for a further 950,000 metric tons of fuel oil or its equivalent in economic aid.

Reports from outside the country trying to account for the firing of Pak Pong-ju, who had been prime minister since 2003, by the Supreme People&#8217;s Assembly at its annual meeting this week and the decision to replace him with Land and Transport Minister Kim Yong-il differed. No official explanation was given, but some analysts in South Korea said Mr. Pak may have fallen afoul of the military, while others cited speculation of a corruption scandal. Others said he might have been removed for failing to move the destitute economy. Some analysts focused on the transport expertise of his successor, saying he could be given the task of pushing ahead with train links with the South to build up the economy.

The agency said the country had failed to meet conditions set up in response to complaints that U.N. money was being diverted to the government of Kim Jong-il.

UNITED NATIONS, March 5  — The United Nations Development Program announced  Monday that it was suspending work inNorth Koreabecause the country had failed to meet conditions set up in response to American complaints that United Nations money was being diverted to the government ofKim Jong-il. “We have decided to suspend our operations, and the ball is really now in the court of the D.P.R. Korean authorities,” said David Morrison, director of communications for the agency, referring to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the country’s official name. The decision, which curtails 20 programs with a budget of $4.4 million, was made Friday, a day after Pak Gil-yon, the North Korean ambassador to the United Nations, met with Ad Melkert, the development program’s associate director, to say that his country would not agree to new conditions for assistance. Those conditions were that the United Nations would stop furnishing payments in hard currency to the government, local vendors and individuals, and stop making in-country hirings subject to government approval. The demands, with a March 1 deadline, were imposed by the development program’s executive board on Jan. 25 after the United States mission charged that the United Nations program had been “systematically perverted for the benefit of the Kim Jong-il regime rather than the people of North Korea.” Mr. Morrison said there was no connection between the announcement and the beginning on Monday, at the  Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York, of two days of talks between North Korea, represented by Kim Kye-gwan,  and the United States, represented by Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs,  on the North Korean nuclear program. “The timing was driven by our undertaking as made explicit in the board decision of the 25th of January to only continue our operations in the D.P.R.K. if certain conditions were met by March 1, which was Thursday,” he said. The development program also said in January that it was narrowing its program to what Mr. Morrison said were “activities designed more directly to benefit the North Korean people rather than to build capacity of the North Korean government.” Mr. Morrison said the North Koreans responded that this action “represented a politicization of the foreign assistance process.” He added that a decision on whether to end the work of the eight international staff members and 15 Koreans involved would be made  within two or three days. In a letter to Ambassador Pak on Friday, the program’s administrator, Kemal Dervis, said, “Should circumstances change at a later date, we would be willing to reconsider this position.” The program’sWeb sitelists agricultural recovery, productivity and rural energy as developmental activities in North Korea. Mr. Morrison said aid would continue under two other United Nations organs, the World Food Program and Unicef, the children’s agency. In the aftermath of the American charges in January, Secretary General Ban Ki-moon ordered a full external audit of United Nations operations in North Korea, beginning with the development program. “As far as I know, this will not affect the investigation,” Michelle Montas, Mr. Ban’s spokeswoman, said Monday.

Despite cautious words from an American envoy, North Korea appeared closer to agreeing to a deal on Friday.
==::==
2007-02-10T00:00:00Z
==::==
BEIJING, Feb. 9 —North Koreaand the United States appeared on Friday to be inching closer to a deal that would establish a schedule for the North to shut down and seal its main nuclear facilities within two months, in return for shipments of fuel oil from South Korea and the beginning of talks over normalization of relations with Washington. But the top American envoy negotiating the deal here cautioned that   the two sides remained stuck on “one or two” small issues. “Nothing is agreed unless everything is agreed,” the envoy, Christopher R. Hill,  an assistant secretary of state, told reporters as he returned to his hotel Friday night. “So I just want to be careful about predicting success tomorrow.” But in Washington, officials at the White House and the State Department were preparing for a major announcement this weekend, and  described the agreement as very different from  the nuclear freeze that the Clinton administration negotiated in 1994. That agreement ultimately fell apart, and the North has produced enough fuel for more than half a dozen nuclear weapons during President Bush’s term. “This is the Libya model,” said one senior administration official, referring to Libya’s decision in late 2003 to turn over all of the equipment it had purchased from the secret nuclear network run by the Pakistani scientist, Abdul Qadeer Khan, to produce bomb fuel. In that agreement, both the Libyans and the United States executed a series of steps, in a carefully negotiated order, that rid the country of nuclear technology and ended its isolation. It is still unclear exactly what sort of timeline North Korea would agree to, and how quickly it would turn over the plutonium it has produced, along with whatever weapons it may have built. In the past, the Bush administration has said it would never agree to the kind of “freeze” that President Clinton signed, because North Korea was not forced to give up its weapons fuel before it reaped rewards. That allowed the country to quickly restart its nuclear program, officials said. Administration officials say this agreement would be different, because the biggest benefits for the North would come only after it allowed inspectors, sealed its facilities and began to give up its weapons. But those steps will be difficult to monitor, in part because there is a dispute about how much nuclear material the North possesses. In a second stage of the agreement, the North would be required to declare how much nuclear material it has on hand and where it is located, administration officials say. Presumably, that would include the uranium enrichment program that Mr. Khan has admitted helping the North start a decade ago, but which North Korea has denied. On Friday night, Mr. Hill insisted that North Korea would be required to do more than submit to a “freeze,” and also suggested that the process of shutting down the weapons program would be carried out in stages. “We’re interested in shutting things down and continuing, through various phases, to shut down, dismantle, abandon things,” he said. “Freeze doesn’t describe that process. Freeze suggests a process where you freeze, you thaw out, freeze again. We’re not interested in that. We’re interested in kind of a one-way process.” Mr. Hill said he remained “cautiously optimistic” and declined to specify which issues were delaying an agreement, though he suggested that North Korea had unexpectedly stalled on minor details. Negotiations resume Saturday, and Mr. Hill said he still hoped that a deal could be struck by the end of the weekend. The latest negotiations over North Korea’s nuclear weapons program began Thursday in Beijing amid tempered optimism that a breakthrough, if a modest one, might be at hand. North Korea and the United States — the key players in talks that also include China, Japan, South Korea and Russia — held fruitful private meetings last month in Berlin. Mr. Hill and his North Korean counterpart, Kim Kye-gwan, have met privately more than once this week, including for lunch on Friday. Mr. Kim has told reporters that North Korea is “ready to make its first step” toward denuclearization. The starting point in the talks is a  broad accord signed in September 2005, in which North Korea agreed in principle to end its nuclear weapons program in exchange for a package of economic  and energy aid, as well as security guarantees. Subsequent negotiations stalled over the contested details of how and when the accord would be carried out. This week, though, a rough initial timeline has emerged. Russian, South Korean and Japanese news agencies have reported that a draft proposal circulated by China this week  would require North Korea to stop operations at its nuclear reactors and procession facilities within two months in exchange for initial shipments of aid, including energy supplies such as heavy oil. None of the negotiators have spoken publicly about the specifics of the proposal, but Mr. Hill confirmed that it would require “both sides” to take “initial actions” within weeks. Such a deal would constitute only a first phase of an overall denuclearization plan, and Mr. Hill suggested that more rounds of negotiations could be held in March and April. The paramount goal of the talks is eliminating North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but the negotiations have been complicated by a host of related issues. Mr. Hill said the proposed draft would also create five working groups to negotiate  separate issues. Analysts say these are likely to include denuclearization, financial sanctions and normalizing diplomatic relations between North Korea and the United States and Japan. The United States infuriated the North Koreans when it froze $24 million of their country’s  assets and accused them of laundering counterfeit dollars. North Korea has demanded that the money be released, and financial negotiators from both countries met last week in Beijing. No deal was announced, and some analysts have questioned whether a stalemate could sink a larger denuclearization deal. But Mr. Hill said the money dispute was not one of the sticking points holding up the current deal. “When I talk about one or two issues,” he said of the unresolved problems, “that is not one of them.”

The United States was seeking to revive stalled negotiations to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.

==::==
BERLIN, Jan. 17 — Seeking to revive stalled negotiations to endNorth Korea’s nuclear weapons program, the United States held   “substantive” talks with North Korean diplomats here on Tuesday and Wednesday, said the chief American envoy, Christopher R. Hill. The unusual one-on-one sessions, the first to be held outside Beijing during the Bush administration, were signs of progress since  negotiations broke off in December after North Korea demanded that Washington lift financial sanctions against it. “It was a substantive discussion,” Mr. Hill said in an interview on Wednesday, though he refused to give details. “The proof of the pudding will be when we all sit down together in the six-party negotiations.” Mr. Hill briefed Secretary of StateCondoleezza Riceon his meetings upon her arrival in Germany after a mission through the Middle East and Persian Gulf. Ms. Rice said later that Mr. Hill’s discussions “should help to prepare the way for a more favorable atmosphere at the time of the resumption of the six-party talks, which we would hope would be soon.” Mr. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, expressed hopes that those broader negotiations — which would also include China, South Korea, Japan and Russia — would resume by the end of this month in Beijing, the traditional host for these talks. An official in the North Korean Embassy here declined to comment on the talks, which are being led on its side by Kim Kye-gwan. Persuading North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-il, to abandon his nuclear ambitions has seemed an increasingly hopeless exercise since October, when North Korea tested a nuclear device and declared itself a nuclear state. The most recent talks, American officials said, foundered when the North Korean negotiators proved unyielding on the most basic issues. Still, the United States was eager to try again, seizing on a visit to Berlin by Mr. Kim to arrange a meeting with Mr. Hill, who was here ostensibly to give a talk at the American Academy in Berlin. American officials appeared encouraged by the tone of the discussions. North Korea, they noted, was open to talking despite declaring last month that it would not discuss disarmament unless the United States lifted penalties against the Banco Delta Asia in Macao, which held North Korean assets. The measures, which the United States said it imposed because of North Korea’s counterfeiting of American money and laundering of proceeds from drug running, cut off one of the North’s  valuable channels to international financial markets. On Wednesday, Russia called on the United States to remove the measures. “The United States should make some step towards the Koreans by lifting the sanctions,” the new Russian chief negotiator, Aleksandr Lusyakov, said in an interview with a Russian news agency, RIA. Treasury officials have held their own negotiations with North Korea to resolve this standoff, and plan to meet again next week, either in Beijing or New York, according to Mr. Hill. But he suggested that the United States did not intend to ease the pressure on North Korea’s finances. “We’ve had to make it clear to the North Koreans that as long as they are involved in nuclear weapons production, their international financing will come under scrutiny,” he said. Because of the arcane way that Washington and North Korea communicate in their relationship as long-term adversaries and occasional negotiating partners, some brief language in a speech Mr. Hill delivered here Wednesday provoked significant interest. Mr. Hill issued what some heard as a tantalizing offer that the United States, within the obligations of a 2005 agreement emerging from the six-party talks, looked forward “to establishing a normal relationship with North Korea.” “Obviously this is via a bilateral process, which will take a long time,” he said. North Korea has long tried to push the United States into formal bilateral talks, as a means of seeking status and legitimacy as well as to decouple Washington from its regional allies. The United States has insisted that formal talks with North Korea be held only in the six-party format. Asked to clarify whether the United States was dangling a new relationship before the North Koreans, Ms. Rice said late Wednesday that United States-North Korea ties would have to evolve within the six-party framework, and that Washington was unwavering in demanding a complete and verifiable end to the North’s nuclear program. The 2005 statement signed by the six parties “envisioned that the denuclearization of the North Korean Peninsula would lead to a bilateral — a normalization of relations between the United States and the D.P.R.K.,” Ms. Rice said, using the initials of North Korea’s official name. By engaging North Korea directly, outside China, the United States must tread carefully, a senior official involved in the talks said. American officials informed China of the meeting in Berlin, and Mr. Hill is headed to Beijing, as well as to Seoul and Tokyo, after he leaves Germany. Though the six-party talks have been held exclusively in Beijing, North Korea has used Berlin as a diplomatic venue in the past, for example during the 1990s for talks with the Clinton administration. It maintains a large embassy here, a legacy of the days of East German Communism. Ms. Rice landed here after completing meetings with Arab allies in the Middle East and Persian Gulf, and she flew over Iraq en route to Berlin. Her trip also included talks in Israel and the Palestinian territories, an effort to push ahead stalled peace talks. During an evening news conference here, Ms. Rice announced that the so-called quartet — a group of negotiators that includes the United States, the European Union, the United Nations and Russia — will meet in Washington in early February to help restart the Middle East talks.

Pyongyang had announced the biggest political gathering in decades for September — but it hasn’t happened yet.
==::==
2010-09-16T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — For weeks,North Koreawatchers have been eagerly awaiting what would be the biggest political gathering there in decades:an announced meetingof the reclusive state’s ruling Workers’ Party in “early” September to select the party’s top leadership. The first half of the month passed on Wednesday without any sign that the meeting had taken place, intensifying speculation that something was amiss. The meeting would not be routine. The North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, would be bringing together party delegates in the capital, Pyongyang, for the first time in 30 years. That has generated conjecture that he might use the event to help his third son, Kim Jong-un, make his debut as the country’s future leader. “There are good reasons to suspect that something in Pyongyang went wrong again, and the longer the delay is, the greater the scale of these unknown problems is likely to be,” said Andrei Lankov, a North Korea expert at Kookmin University in Seoul. “Even if the conference will open among the usual pomp later this week, the inability or unwillingness to convene it as initially scheduled still should not be ignored.” Several analysts cited recent severe floods as a possible factor. Good Friends, a Buddhist relief agency that says it has informants inside North Korea, said in a newsletter on Wednesday that the party meeting had been postponed because flood-damaged roads and communication lines prevented the government from gathering enough delegates. The South Korean unification minister, Hyun In-taek, said: “It may be because of the flooding, or there could be various other reasons. There appear to be internal reasons.” Cheong Seong-chang, an analyst at Sejong Institute, south of Seoul, said, “Kim Jong-il must have considered it a big burden to stage a major political event for his son’s debut while people lost lives and homes.” Mr. Kim maintains such secrecy that analysts often rely on unconfirmed news accounts, secondhand information relayed through recent defectors and occasional intelligence reports to make often conflicting conjectures. When Mr. Kim was rising to power decades ago, speculation raged as to whether his father, President Kim Il-sung, would eventually hand over power to his son and whether the son, depicted as a hard-drinking womanizer in news media outside North Korea, was capable of leading the country. Now, similar speculation and skepticism abound about Kim Jong-un. His sudden appearance in the North’s succession game a few years ago set news media outside the North scrambling to a Japanese chef who once cooked for the Kim family and to former classmates at a Swiss school where the younger Kim once studied. But little is known about the son. Analysts vary widely over whether he would get prominent party posts in the party meeting or, even if he were made Kim Jong-il’s successor, how long he would last once his father died. Kim Jong-il isbelieved to have had a stroke in 2008. Amid the information blackout, the delay in the party meeting is feeding imaginations. The South Korean news media had earlier speculated that North Korea delayed the conference because Mr. Kim’s health deteriorated after he made a trip to China late last month, or because not all the power elite was happy with the choice of Mr. Kim’s successor. Kim Yong-hyun, a North Korea expert at Dongguk University in Seoul, doubted those reports. He noted that Mr. Kim apparently was still active in his tours of factories and farms and that his solid grip on power precluded any serious challenge to his decisions. A far bigger challenge for Mr. Kim — and another possible cause of the delay — was the task of persuading party representatives gathering after such a long hiatus that he and his son would fix the economy and ease chronic food shortages, said Mr. Kim, the Dongguk analyst. Whatever the reasons, “one thing seems to be fairly certain,” Mr. Lankov said. “Something unusual is happening in Pyongyang these days.”

Former President Jimmy Carter left Friday with an American whose release he helped to secure.
==::==

SEOUL, South Korea — Former PresidentJimmy CarterleftNorth Koreaon Friday with Aijalon Mahli Gomes, an American who was sentenced to eight years of hard labor for illegally entering the country, the Carter Center said. Mr. Gomes was granted amnesty by the North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, the Carter Center said in an e-mail. Mr. Gomes, 31, and Mr. Carter boarded a plane at the Pyongyang Airport. “It is expected that Mr. Gomes will be returned to Boston, Mass., early Friday afternoon, to be reunited with his mother and other members of his family,” the statement said. Mr. Carter had been visiting Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, on a private humanitarian mission to win the release of Mr. Gomes, who was sentenced in April to eight years in a North Korean prison and fined $700,000 for entering the country illegally. There has also been speculation that North Korea might try to use Mr. Carter as a conduit to ease tensions with the United States. Mr. Carter had arrived on Wednesday at the invitation of the North Korean government, but it was not known whether he met with Mr. Kim, the North Korean leader. South Korean officials said Thursday that a special train believed to be carrying Mr. Kim had entered China around midnight on Wednesday, setting off speculation over what might have compelled him to travel to his isolated government’s closest ally while Mr. Carter was visiting. After watching Mr. Kim’s movements for the past few days, the South Korean authorities said his train had crossed the border with China, traveling from the North Korean town of Manpo to Jian in China, according to an official at the presidential Blue House in Seoul. Two South Korean intelligence sources who, like the presidential aide, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter, said Mr. Kim might be taking his son with him to introduce him formally to Chinese leaders. South Korean news outlets raised the same possibility. Mr. Kim is grooming his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, as successor, according to South Korean officials. North Korea is to convene a congress of its ruling Workers’ Party early next month, where Mr. Kim is expected to rally popular support for his succession plans. If confirmed, this would be Mr. Kim’s sixth trip to China, his impoverished country’s largest trading partner and aid provider. His last trip was in May, when he met President Hu Jintao during a five-day visit. North Korea and China usually do not confirm a trip by Mr. Kim until it is over. News of the possible trip by Mr. Kim led to rampant speculation in South Korea. Possible motives cited by analysts in Seoul included the North’s need for Chinese aid because of flooding and the possibility of a decline in Mr. Kim’s health, which might have forced aides to take him to China for treatment. Many intelligence officials believe Mr. Kim had a stroke in 2008. Around the time that Mr. Kim’s train crossed the border, North Korean news media reported that China would provide emergency flood relief. With North Korea’s relations with the South and the United States at a low point, “China is the only one Kim Jong-il can go to for aid,” said Kim Keun-sik, an analyst at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. “He badly needs aid before the party meeting to make it a national festival, as it is meant to be.” Even so, leaving North Korea without meeting Mr. Carter would be a notable breach of diplomatic etiquette, the analyst said. “A possible political message of this is that North Korea gives its priority to China over the United States,” he said. Mr. Carter was the second former United States president to visit Pyongyang on a humanitarian mission in recent years. In August last year, Bill Clinton met Mr. Kim there andreturnedwith Laura Ling and Euna Lee, two American journalists held there fortrespassing in the North. Mr. Gomes is believed to have entered North Korea in support of Robert Park, a fellow Christian activist from the United States, who crossed into the country from China in December to call on Mr. Kim to release all political prisoners. Mr. Park was expelled after some 40 days. In South Korea, where he had worked as an English teacher, Mr. Gomes attended rallies calling for Mr. Park’s release. In January, North Korean announced his arrest. In April, it sentenced him to eight years of hard labor and fined $700,000 for illegal entry and and committing a “hostile act.” China’s Foreign Ministry had no comment on reports of Mr. Kim’s  visit. Two teachers told The Associated Press that Mr. Kim spent 20 minutes Thursday at Yuwen Middle School in Jilin, in the northeast, where his father, Kim Il-sung, attended classes from 1927 to 1930. On Friday Mr. Kim had reportedly left Jilin and was heading to Changchun. There was no word on whether his son was accompanying him.

SEOUL, South Korea — An American citizen facing trial inNorth Koreafor entering the country illegally is a Christian who taught English at a South Korean primary school, former colleagues said Tuesday. On Monday, North Korea identified the man as Aijalon Mahli Gomes, 30, of Boston, and said he would be put on trial because the North Korean authorities had “confirmed criminal evidence.” He was arrested in January. “Mr. Gomes was a quiet man and was very diligent in church activities,” said Kang Hyang-seon, a teacher who worked with him at Sinbong Elementary School in Pocheon, a town north of Seoul near the border with North Korea. Mr. Gomes flew into South Korea in the spring of 2008 for a one-year teaching job with Sinbong. South Korea draws thousands of native English speakers every year from the United States, Canada and elsewhere to teach English at schools. His contract with Sinbong expired on March 31 last year, and he did not renew it, the school said. At Sinbong, he taught 20 hours a week helping third graders to sixth graders learn English. Mr. Gomes told his colleagues that he wanted to move to a town closer to Seoul so it would be easier for him to attend a foreigners’ church in the industrial district of Kuro. They remembered his  talking about doing volunteer community work with other Christians. “He was a polite man and was very nice toward children,” said Chung Pil-gyu, another Sinbong teacher. No one at Sinbong knew what had happened to Mr. Gomes after he left the school a year ago. Officials at the American Embassy in Seoul were not immediately available for comment on Tuesday. The State Department has not confirmed the man’s identity. It has been working with Swedish diplomats in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, to contact the man now identified as Mr. Gomes. Washington and the North have no diplomatic ties. Last year, North Korea arrestedtwo American journalists— Laura Ling and Euna Lee — and sentenced them to 12 years of hard labor forillegally entering the North. The women were pardoned and released five months later, after former President Bill ClintonvisitedPyongyang in August and met the nation’s leader, Kim Jong-il, to negotiate their release. Robert Park, a Christian missionary from Tucson,illegally entered North Koreaon Dec. 25 carrying a letter urging Mr. Kim to shut down prison camps and free political prisoners. North Koreareleased himlast month, saying that Mr. Park had recognized his wrongdoings and repented.

If confirmed, the easing of controls could signal a political setback for North Korea’s government after it introduced a new currency and closed private markets.

SEOUL, South Korea — Facing food shortages, severe price increases and social unrest,North Koreaappears to have relaxed, at least temporarily, its broad crackdown on private markets by allowing them to reopen with price caps, news reports and officials in Seoul said Friday. If confirmed, the move to allow the buying and selling of goods outside the country’s tightly controlled state distribution system could signal a political setback for the government of Kim Jong-il. North Korea had recently introduced a new currency and closed private markets in an effort to restore a purer form of central economic planning. Indications that the country may be easing restrictions on trading follow reports this week that Mr. Kim had dismissed the official who oversaw the introduction of a new currency and the effective confiscation of private wealth in November. North Korea has not officially announced either of those developments, and it was not possible to verify them independently. In the past week, the news media and government officials in Seoul have reported rare outbursts of protest in the North, but said that the episodes seemed isolated and that there were few signs of organized dissent. By Thursday, North Korea had begun allowing trading in markets again, the South Korean news agency Yonhap said, citing unidentified sources familiar with the North Korean situation. On Friday, Daily NK, a Web site based in Seoul that collects news from sources in the North, reported that the North Korean authorities had allowed the markets to reopen but imposed caps on market prices. “In the past few days, we have learned that market activities are coming back in the North,” said a senior South Korean government official whose departmental regulations barred him from speaking on the record about North Korea. “But we are not sure yet whether this is a policy reversal effective throughout the North or is some temporary adjustment.” North Korea had previously imposed price caps on the markets but had failed to arrest inflation, analysts in Seoul said. Daily NK’s report expressed doubt  that the latest price controls would work. Although they were much higher than the ones reportedly announced shortly after the currency reform, the new prices set by the government were still lower than those on theblack market, it said. The authorities were warning that those who ignored the price regulations would have their goods confiscated, Daily NK said. Since 2005, North Korea had taken a series of steps aimed at suppressing the markets, banning food sales outside the state’s ration system, banishing young women from the markets and suppressing smuggling from China. The strongest steps the government took against markets and the new class of traders who have profited from them began in late November when it abolished its old bank notes, requiring North Koreans to turn in their money for new bills at a rate of 100 to 1. By limiting how much they could turn in for the new currency to about $30 per person, the government wiped out much of private wealth, believing that that would help arrest inflation. But prices of food and most other basic goods have since soared, as the state-run production and distribution system has not managed to meet demand. Daily NK reported that after the government’s lifting of the private-trading ban,food pricesin some towns began easing slightly. Yonhap reported that although markets reopened, people remained suspicious of the government’s intentions. It is unclear whether protests in the North have had any destabilizing effect Mr. Kim’s government, which has survived for years despite a dismal economy and a devastating famine. Some analysts said the seemingly mistaken economic policies could have a lasting impact. North Korea’s blunder with its currency “carried the risk of making North Koreans frustrated and fundamentally skeptical about their system and authorities,” said Cho Han-beom, an analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, a government research organization in Seoul. He said a possible summit meeting being discussed between the Koreas might be a signal of the North’s need for outside aid to help defuse economic instability. The North’s economic plight deepened under United Nations sanctions imposed in response to its nuclear test last year. Internationalfood aidhas also decreased during the nuclear standoff. Yet others said they doubted that unrest was especially widespread or threatening to the government. “People can protest, but large-scale protests are impossible in the North,” said Lee Dong-bok, a former high-ranking intelligence official in Seoul. Mr. Lee said North Korean villages were divided into tiny cells that allowed the party and military members loyal to Mr. Kim to monitor each household and to block the spread of information. For years, North Korea has openly admitted food shortages, but it has blamed “hostile” American policies that it said drove it to spend most of its resources to build arms. In the past week, North Korean news media quoted Mr. Kim as saying he would redouble his efforts to fulfill the government’s promise to feed its people with “rice and meat soup.”

Washington seems to be on a new drive to stop sales of nuclear know-how, not to strike deals that only go bad.

Bill Clinton’s rescue mission to Pyongyang last week may have done more than win the freedom of two young American journalists. To many in Washington, it seemed to reconfirm hints of just how shrunkenNorth Korea’s ambitions (not to mention its leader) have become after years of confrontation with the world. Desperate for some affirmation of his legacy, this interpretation goes, the ailing Kim Jong Il used the drama to draw a former American president onto his own turf. To North Korea’s hungry populace, it doubtless looked as if the Americans had finally come to pay homage. But the truth is that North Korea no longer instills fear the way it did even during the Clinton presidency, when it once threatened to turn Seoul into a “sea of fire” if it did not get its way. For all the nuclear and missile tests the North has recently staged, such a threat today rings hollow. The North still has well-hidden artillery that could do great harm, but South Korean officials say they know that North Korea’s air force does not have enough fuel to send fighters aloft to practice for long, much less to initiate a war. And South Koreans are so unafraid of a 1950s-style invasion that they have built housing developments to the edge of the demilitarized zone dividing the Koreas. All of which seems to lend weight to the Obama administration’s instinct that this is a moment, in the words of a senior adviser to President  Obama, to “break the cycle” set under Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush: the North’s serial nuclear provocations lead to a payoff and an agreement that then falls apart, leading to another crisis and another payoff. So Mr. Obama’s aides say they are accelerating a gradual refocusing of policy away from the receding prospects of all-out war, and onto classic “containment” of the North’s one last big asset: its ability to teach other nations how to put together the building blocks of the bomb. What seems to be new is the single-minded focus on choking off Pyongyang’s efforts to sell its know-how, rather than pressing for “regime change” as Mr. Bush did in his first term, or trying too hard to lure North Korea with the prospect of full integration with the West, which Mr. Clinton dangled years ago. “We just want to make sure the government of North Korea is operating within the basic rules of the international community,” Mr. Obama told MSNBC last week. No one in Washington will admit — at least on the record — that “containment” has become the primary objective; indeed, the government’s official goal is still “complete, verifiable nuclear disarmament,” wording drawn from the Bush era. But few of Mr. Obama’s aides, some of whom have wrestled with North Korea for two decades, believe that the North will ever give up everything in its nuclear panoply — or that the outside world could ever be sure that it had. The more immediate, and practical, goal, then, is to neutralize Mr. Kim’s ability to reap cash and power from exporting its know-how for building a crude nuclear device. Mr. Obama won a little-publicized victory in that effort a few weeks ago when the White House used newly granted authority from the United Nations to put a destroyer on the tail of the Kang Nam I, a rusting cargo ship believed to be taking weapons to Myanmar, formerly Burma. No one is sure what the cargo was, and the Navy avoided a direct confrontation. But the Kang Nam finally turned around and went home, its cargo undelivered. Still, there are reasons to wonder whether containment of North Korea can work. The core idea is that wariness and time are the best instruments with which to let a corrupt, inept government rot from within, as when the Soviet Union collapsed. “I wish they’d conduct a nuclear test every week,” a member of Mr. Obama’s team joked recently, referring to estimates that North Korea has only enough fuel for 8 to 12 weapons. The problem is that every American president since Harry Truman has underestimated how much rot the North Korean regime could withstand. Each thought the North could fall on his watch. After all, it has been the most sanctioned nation on earth since the early 1950’s, and it has recently cut the few deep economic ties that it made in the past decade with the South. Some former officials, who have dealt with the North as it veered between wary interaction with its foes and overstated threats, interpreted North Korea’s demand for Mr. Clinton’s appearance in exchange for the journalists’ release as a sign that Mr. Kim might be eager to change course one more time. “They are clearly sending signals that they are ready to engage,” said Wendy Sherman, who guided Korea strategy for Mr. Clinton from the State Department. Mr. Obama has said that when North Korea is ready to return to six-nation talks, so is he. But several top officials acknowledge being surprised by North Korea’s move early this year to throw out the agreements reached at the end of the Bush era, restart its nuclear plant and test another nuclear weapon. And that has led them to toughen some of the pressure on Pyongyang. There is new attention, for example, on shutting down North Korean bank accounts and suppliers. There are new sanctions against several firms that have been financing North Korea’s missile trade, including an Iranian company. Under the United Nations resolution, member nations are being pressed to deny North Korean ships fuel and food unless their cargoes are inspected. Still, intelligence about North Korean activities is notoriously poor, and there are unconfirmed reports that the North is helping the Burmese build a reactor in their country. But perhaps the greatest risk in a containment strategy is one of inconsistency. Two Bushes, two Clintons and President Obama himself have vowed that the world will never tolerate a nuclear North Korea. If America does end up tolerating it, the Iranians will take notice. Which is why Israeli officials bring up North Korea whenever American officials talk to them about Iran’s nuclear ambitions. You Americans can try containment with North Korea, they say; it’s your problem. But don’t try to extend the concept to Iran.

An effort to bring a seemingly unyielding North Korea to heel over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
==::==
2009-07-17T00:00:00Z
==::==
UNITED NATIONS — In its latest effort to bring a seemingly unyieldingNorth Koreato heel over itsnuclear weaponsand ballistic missile programs, theUnited Nations Security Councilimposed sanctionson five trading companies and five individuals on Thursday, in addition to banning the trade of two goods linked to building ballistic missiles. The North Korean men and companies that were cited, including Hong Kong Electronics, a trading company based in the Iranian free-trade zone of Kish Island in the Persian Gulf, are the core elements of North Korea’s attempts to build nuclear weapons, diplomats said. The sanctions include a travel ban and an asset freeze on the five individuals, although it is unclear how often they travel internationally or whether they hold any foreign bank accounts. “The individuals are closely involved and responsible for these programs; they are very senior,” Yukio Takasu, the Japanese ambassador to the United Nations, said. “We have full confidence this will have a major impact.” The call for new sanctions was included ina Security Council resolutionthat was passed in June after North Korea conducted its most recent nuclear test on May 25. The North has adopted a bellicose stance toward all United Nations actions,firing off batches of missilesto thumb its nose at the threat of additional penalties. “This is probably not enough for a major North Korea response,” David C. Kang, a professor of international relations at the University of Southern California, said by telephone from Seoul. “It will hurt them in any attempt to sell weapons, so as a restraint it might be good. But in terms of getting them to change their behavior, I don’t believe that is going to happen.” The country’s belligerent attitude has been linked to the question of who will succeedKim Jong-il, the leader who is visibly ailing. South Koreans are debating whether a transition to one of Mr. Kim’s sons would bring new calm or renewed challenges to the outside world, Professor Kang said. Western diplomats said the new sanctions were determined by consensus among the Council’s 15 members, with some horse-trading, particularly with China, North Korea’s most important trading partner and ally. The Council will investigate other companies and individuals. The sanctioned companies are the Namchongang Trading Corporation, linked to purchases of pumps, aluminum tubes and other materials used in uranium enrichment; Hong Kong Electronics, which has transferred millions of dollars for Tanchon Commercial Bank; the Korea Hyoksin Trading Corporation, involved in the development of nuclear and other weapons; the General Bureau of Atomic Energy, which runs the nuclear program; and the Korean Tangun Trading Corporation, which buys much of the military research materials. The sanctioned individuals are Yun Ho-jin, director of Namchongang Trading; Ri Je-son, director of the atomic energy bureau; Hwang Sok-hwa, chief of science at the bureau; Ri Hong-sop, former director of the Yongbyon Nuclear Research Center; and Han Yu-ro, head of another trading company involved in the ballistic missile program. The goods subjected to a trading ban are a special kind of graphite and a Kevlar filament or tape, which an American official said were used in rockets.

North Korea’s official news agency reported that two U.S. journalists sentenced to long prison terms in labor camps admitted that they crossed into North Korea illegally.

Two American journalists sentenced last week to long prison terms in North Korean labor camps admitted during their trial that they crossed intoNorth Koreaillegally, and confessed to committing their crimes out of political motives, the North’s official news agency reported on Tuesday. The report by the state-runKorea Central News Agencyrepresented the North Korean government’s most detailed account to date of the shadowy circumstances surrounding the arrest, trial andconvictionofLaura Ling, 36, andEuna Lee, 32, both journalists for San Francisco-basedCurrent TV. North Korea sentenced the journalists to 12 years of hard labor on charges of illegal entry and committing hostile acts, dismissing calls for clemency from the women’s families, the United States and other governments. It was unclear why the   news agency released the information on Tuesday. The United Nations Security Councilpassed an enhanced package of sanctionsagainst the isolated nation on Friday in response to  its second underground nuclear test in three years, as well as repeated missile launchings. According to Tuesday’s report, the journalists were detained on the North Korean side of the Tumen River, which serves as part of the boundary between China and North Korea. The Tumen has been used for years by North Korean refugees defecting across the  border. Unlike the swift and deepYalu River, which runs along most of the border between the countries, the Tumen is shallow and narrow, and is easily crossed in spots on foot or by swimming. The KCNA report said that the women’s own confiscated video indicated that they crossed the river illegally. It also said that the women had admitted to fabricating some aspects of their video in order to “defile” the government’s human rights record. “During their trial, they admitted that what they did was a criminal act inspired by political motives of isolating and stifling our republic by defiling our human rights situation through fabricated video footage,” the news agency said. The two women were given courtroom interpreters during their trial at the Central Court, the North’s highest court. Ms. Ling was defended by a lawyer, but Ms. Lee gave up her right to hire a lawyer. The ruling cannot be appealed, the news agency said. “The criminals admitted and accepted the judgment,” the report said. Human rights advocates in South Korea who had helped arrange their trip to China have said that the journalists were on a reporting assignment about the plight of North Korean women sold through human traffickers and refugees fleeing hunger in North Korea when they were detained on March 17. The journalists’ families said they had no intention of crossing the border to the North Korean side. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has called the charges against them “baseless.” Washington has said it will employ “all possible channels to secure their release.” American officials have said that the heavy sentences would likely be used as a negotiating ploy by the North as it tries to fend off a new United Nations resolution that imposes a mandatory ban on arms sales and calls on members to inspect cargo vessels and airplanes suspected of carrying military equipment  in or out of the country.

Negotiations over toughening sanctions againstNorth Koreain the wake of its underground nuclear test last month have stalled over the issue of inspecting cargo ships on the high seas, according to two Security Council diplomats. China has yet to sign off on the idea that North Korean vessels could be stopped and searched, the diplomats said. Ambassadors from the five permanent members of the Security Council — the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France — plus Japan and South Korea, locked in intensive bargaining sessions all week, have agreed on other issues, including widening an arms embargo and financial restrictions, the diplomats said. North Korea has declared cargo inspections an act of war.

Global reaction to the nuclear test is likely to be swift and unforgiving. The repeated provocations will have diminishing returns for Pyongyang.

TOKYO — Lifting economic sanctions, full integration with the West, peace on the Korean peninsula  —  all are up for discussion if North Korea simply rejoins the Six Party Talks. And yet, in another provocative move, Pyongyang has test-fired more missiles and declared a second nuclear test a success, rattling not only the ground in China but the international nonproliferation community as well. While brinksmanship is nothing new for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and previous outbursts have often brought increased attention  —  and rewards  —  this time international reaction is likely to be swift and unforgiving. North Korea has miscalculated the global ire its provocation has raised. On all fronts,  the North is scaling back its interaction with the rest of the world and offering nothing but clenched fists. Missile tests, the unilateral canceling of  contracts with South Korea, the reprocessing of spent fuel rods, and now declaring an exclusive economic zone that conflicts with South Korean maritime claims  —  all point to a newly emboldened military influencing decision-making. These actions indicate the desperate state of  the North, with its ailing leader and unclear succession plans. Theories abound as to what North Korea actually wants:   bargaining leverage to gain bilateral negotiations with the United States? The potential to sell its nuclear material and missile technology  for vital hard currency? Full recognition as a nuclear state, akin to India and Pakistan? No one knows for certain, and it often appears that even North Korea is confused. Whatever the ultimate cause, its  belligerency is having the exact opposite of any intended effects. The much-sought  U.S. attention will be decidedly negative.  Washington’s special representative, Stephen  Bosworth, publicly stated in April a willingness to discuss issues directly with the D.P.R.K. within the overall Six Party process. But  separate, direct negotiations are a near-term impossibility as the United States remains committed to resolving the  conflict with all regional powers. China, Russia, South Korea, Japan, and the United States are closing ranks, increasingly likely to agree on more punitive measures.  All parties now recognize that recalcitrance will require more robust collective action. The few  bridges left with China are burning as  its influence over the North steadily declines. For the North, repeated missile and nuclear tests have diminishing returns since their principal value is demonstrating new capabilities  —  which they have now done. Doubts remain as to the range of their  rockets.  Even the recent nuclear event may have been more a conventional explosion than nuclear fission. Time and air samples will tell. Next in the tired playbook of provocation  is the   possibility of increased activity in the fishing waters along the contested western sea border with South Korea. Naval skirmishes occurred in 1999 and 2002 with the South’s forces prevailing. The risk of embarrassment for  Kim Jong-il’s government is high. International responses to the provocation are limited as well. Successive rounds of sanctions have failed to deter the regime from furthering its nuclear capabilities. This is due in large part to their spotty enforcement. Targeted financial sanctions  will severely limit vital overseas hard-currency earnings. Interdictions at sea of suspect vessels involved in proliferation activities is also an option. Suspending over-flight rights, as India did in 2008 for an Iran-bound Air Koryo flight, could become a more-coordinated effort. China plays an increasing part in any effective sanctions regime. As the only major trading partner left for the North supplying vital energy and food supplies, China has repeatedly said it would not take actions that threaten stability or cause an influx of refugees across the porous border. This risk needs to be re-examined. Limiting oil exports may dim the lights in Pyongyang, but a weakened internal security apparatus triggering popular insurrection and humanitarian disaster is highly unlikely. Historical precedents aside, China’s relationships with South Korea and Japan are becoming increasingly more important and the continued antagonism from North Korea simply puts further strains on an already shaky relationship. All of this tension should be kept in context, however. The danger of  military confrontation on the peninsula is fairly remote, simply because the North  cannot escape the devastating consequences of an attack. Firing a nuclear-tipped missile at Japan or the U.S., if and when capable, is also an extremely remote possibility; it would mean the  annihilation of the regime. Kim and his advisers  should not be misread as irrational or suicidal. Comments regarding the defensive nature of their burgeoning nuclear threat should not be underestimated. Sooner or later the regional pendulum will shift and the Kim regime, or some variant of its successors, will feel confident again through this recent display of relative military might.  They will inevitably realize that talks are the best alternative among a rapidly diminishing set of options to achieve the security and recognition they crave.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The youngest son of the North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, has reportedly been named to the powerful National Defense Commission, an appointment indicating that Mr. Kim’s son is being groomed to take power one day, political analysts said Sunday. The question of who will become the next leader ofNorth Koreahas been the focus of intense attention in the news media and foreign capitals since Mr. Kim, 67, was reported to have had a stroke last summer. Mr. Kim, who has ruled the North with absolute authority since the death of his father, Kim Il-sung, in 1994, has three known sons by two women but has not publicly anointed an  heir. On Sunday, the Yonhap news agency of South Korea reported that Mr. Kim’s youngest son, Kim Jong-un, 26, was assigned to a low-level post at the defense commission several days before North Korea’s rubber-stamp Parliament reappointed Kim Jong-il as the commission’s chairman on April 9. Yonhap, citing unidentified sources it says are privy to North Korean affairs, said the appointment was seen as a step toward training Kim Jong-un as his father’s successor.

North Korea said it would bar outside nuclear inspectors from taking soil and nuclear waste samples, considered crucial to determining the extent of its weapons program.

SEOUL, South Korea — In its first major act of defiance since Senator Barack Obama’s election,North Koreasaid Wednesday that it would bar international nuclear inspectors from taking soil and nuclear waste samples, which are considered crucial to determining the extent of its weapons program. The Foreign Ministry said that American experts would be allowed to visit the main nuclear complex in Yongbyon, north of the capital, Pyongyang, to review documents and interview engineers, according to the North’s state-run Korea Central News Agency. But no samples can be taken, it said. The North also said any inspections by American and United Nations experts must be confined to Yongbyon, where a plutonium-based nuclear plant is being dismantled. That limitation complicates Washington’s attempts to determine whether the North has been pursuing a separate uranium-enrichment program and exporting nuclear technology to countries like Syria. North Korea detonated a plutonium-based device in 2006, adding urgency to arduous six-nation talks to halt the North’s nuclear program. As part of the eventual deal, the North made a declaration in June of its nuclear activities. President Bush then said he was prepared to remove North Korea from a list of state sponsors of terrorism, and the North demolished the cooling tower at its Yongbyon nuclear plant. But it was months before the North was removed from the list, while the United States wrangled with its negotiators over how to verify the North’s nuclear declaration and criticism of the Bush administration — for extracting too few concessions — mounted. Finally, in October, the State Department announced that North Korea had agreed to access “based on mutual consent” to undeclared nuclear sites and “sampling and forensic activities.” North Korea’s statement on Wednesday contradicted that, and further, warned that if the United States diverged from the joint document “even by one word, it could lead inevitably to war.” A State Department spokesman, Robert Wood, said that he could not confirm North Korea’s refusal to allow experts to take samples and remove them from the country for analysis, but he suggested that such a step would violate the agreement to proceed with reciprocal actions. The department said the United States was providing the North with 50,000 metric tons of heavy fuel oil, scheduled to arrive aboard two ships in late November and early December. “It was basically agreed that experts could take samples and remove them from the country for testing,” Mr. Wood said. “So as far as I’m concerned, the United States is doing its part with regard to action for action.” On Wednesday, North Korea also said it would close a border crossing with South Korea beginning Dec. 1, effectively halting work at an industrial complex that is the last major symbol of inter-Korean reconciliation. That announcement followed repeated warnings from the North that after a decade of reconciliation efforts, relations between the Koreas were deteriorating to a point approaching confrontation. Halting border traffic will idle tourist buses taking South Koreans to Kaesong, an ancient Korean city just north of the border. Kaesong is also the site of a joint industrial zone where South Korean factories employ North Korean laborers. North Korea opened Kaesong to South Korean tourists and factories under the previous government in Seoul. It receives badly needed cash from tourist fees and factory wages totaling around $3 million a month. By shutting Kaesong, the North is apparently trying to press Lee Myung-bak, the conservative South Korean president, whose predecessor, Roh Moo-hyun, had pursued a policy of rapprochement. Since Mr. Lee took office in February promising a harder line on North Korea, relations have rapidly chilled. Kaesong has been  cited as a prime example of South Korean efforts to transform the totalitarian North by implanting capitalism. The Kaesong complex produced $366 million worth of goods in the first half of this year, and the flow of goods accounted for 42 percent of trade between the Koreas. Another tourism project in the North’s Diamond Mountain on the eastern frontier was suspended this year as the two Koreas bickered over the shooting death of a South Korean tourist there by the North’s military in July. South Korea called the North’s latest threat “regrettable,” and officials said the North needed time to adjust itself to the Lee government and the election of Mr. Obama. In recent months, North Korea bitterly protested the propaganda leaflets conservative South Korean activists send to the North to criticize its leader, Kim Jong-il. The leaflets, scattered from balloons, have rattled the North at a time when Mr. Kim is said to have suffered a stroke. Mr. Obama’s election also raised hopes among some experts here that the United States would be more eager to strike a deal with the North.

North Korea said that it had stopped disabling its main nuclear complex and threatened to restore facilities there, accusing the U.S. of not keeping its promise to take the country off a terrorism blacklist.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreasaid Tuesday that it had stopped disabling its main nuclear complex and threatened to restore facilities there that the North had used to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons unless the United States removed it from a terrorist list. For months, United States experts and North Korean engineers have been disabling key facilities at the complex at Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang, the capital, in a move that temporarily shut down the North’s only known source of plutonium. If North Korea rebuilds the facilities in defiance of the United States and a coalition of major powers that have sought to disarm North Korea, it would nullify a major foreign policy achievement of the Bush administration. North Korea often issues strident warnings as a negotiating tactic but the latest declaration still dimmed the administration’s hopes of achieving a breakthrough in the North’s nuclear disarmament before President Bush leaves office in January. The State Department described the announcement as a “step backward.” “This certainly is in violation of their commitments to the six-party framework,” a State Department spokesman, Robert Wood, told reporters, according to Reuters. North Korea accused Washington of not keeping its promise to take North Korea off a terrorism blacklist. The United States wants North Korea to agree to a comprehensive method of checking whether it withheld information in a report on its past nuclear activities before it removes North Korea from the list. A White House spokesman, Tony Fratto, said North Korea had informed Washington that it had halted its work at the plant temporarily. “We’ve informed North Korea that we will take action to rescind its designation when it fulfills its commitment regarding verification,” he said. The state-run news agency, KCNA, quoted a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying: “We have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities. This measure has been effective on Aug. 14, and related parties have been notified of it.” Work started at Yongbyon late last year to disable a nuclear reactor, a factory that produces fuel for the reactor and a laboratory that can extract plutonium from spent fuel rods. North Korea demolished the reactor’s cooling tower in June. It would take at least a year to restart the disabled facilities, experts said. Disabling the complex does not meet Washington’s ultimate goal of dismantling it. The United States wants full access by inspectors to all locations it suspects of being nuclear sites to ensure that there are no hidden nuclear assets. The North bristled at this demand. “The U.S. is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in our country as it pleases, just as it did in Iraq,” the North Korean spokesman said. He said North Korea was still technically at war with the United States because the 1950-53 Korean War had ended only in a cease-fire. He added that asking the North to give up its nuclear programs while it was not allowed similar inspections in South Korea, to make sure that there are no American nuclear weapons there, amounted to “a gangster’s demand.” North Korea has sought for years to be removed from a list of state sponsors of terrorism.

The Bush administration displayed an admirable and all too rare mixture of diplomatic creativity, flexibility, patience and follow-through in the North Korea deal.

If North Korea lives up to its promise to begin disabling key parts of its nuclear program within weeks, and to finish the job by year’s end, the world will be a safer place. To get this deal, the Bush administration, after dragging its feet for four years, displayed an admirable and all too rare mixture of diplomatic creativity, flexibility, patience and follow-through. To keep it moving forward, it will need even more. Like all diplomatic deals worth their salt, both sides had to give up a lot. North Korea’s paranoid leadership has agreed to a degree of transparency few would have predicted. A team of American experts is expected to travel to North Korea next week to begin the disabling, at America’s expense, of its nuclear reactor, plutonium separation plant and other parts of its Yongbyon nuclear complex. The North Koreans also promised to come clean about how much plutonium they have produced — suspected to be at least 10 bombs’ worth — and to prove that they’re not hiding a separate uranium enrichment program, as Washington has alleged. President Bush — who once famously declared that he loathed North Korea’s leader — has agreed to reward Pyongyang, knowing that it has yet to commit to give up those plutonium stocks and whatever weapons it has built. The United States and North Korea’s neighbors will provide North Korea with a large amount of fuel oil. Washington has also promised to lift trade sanctions, drop North Korea from its list of terrorism-sponsoring nations and move toward normalizing relations. With both sides playing against type, there is bound to be very tough moments ahead. This week’s agreement is already months behind schedule, and Pyongyang will likely delay, obfuscate and demand a lot more. Many conservative critics — outside the administration and in — are already denouncing the deal, and its chief negotiator, Christopher Hill, as a sellout and the attacks will likely only get worse. (A classier administration would do a lot more to defend its negotiator.) The good news is that Mr. Bush and his secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, are apparently so eager for an enduring foreign policy victory, in hopes of offsetting their failures in Iraq, that they are willing to be patient. Even a recent stealth Israeli strike on Syrian targets, reportedly related to North Korea nuclear activity, failed to derail the negotiations. This week’s joint statement pointedly noted that North Korea had re-affirmed its commitment not to transfer nuclear technology and know-how. The next phase — getting rid of North Korea’s fissile material and any weapons — will be even tougher to negotiate. Pyongyang will inevitably make more expensive and difficult demands. North Korea is already insisting on  the same kind of light-water nuclear reactors promised under a 1994 agreement with the Clinton administration that President Bush eagerly jettisoned with Pyongyang’s help. It’s worth the effort. We also hope that with a solid foreign policy success now in reach, Mr. Bush will learn the lesson of the North Korea deal and tell his diplomats to turn the same creativity, flexibility and follow-through toward trying to end Iran’s nuclear program.

The top American negotiator with North Korea said that the country agreed to account to international monitors for all of its nuclear programs.

The top American negotiator withNorth Koreasaid yesterday that the country had agreed to disable its main nuclear fuel production plant by the end of the year and to account to international monitors for all of its nuclear programs, including what American intelligence agencies say they believe was a second, secret program purchased from Pakistan. At the end of a two-day meeting in Geneva — exactly the kind of one-on-one session that the Bush administration had refused to hold in recent years — Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, said the two sides had agreed on what would be a speedy next step, following action by North Korea this summer to turn off its main nuclear reactor. “One thing that we agreed on is that the D.P.R.K. will provide a full declaration of all of their nuclear programs and will disable their nuclear programs by the end of this year, 2007,” Mr. Hill told reporters in Geneva, according to The Associated Press. He was using the initials for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the North’s formal name. But in a separate news conference, his counterpart, Kim Kye-gwan, who heads the North Korean negotiating team, made no mention of an end-of-the-year deadline. He spoke instead of an accord to disable North Korea’s equipment and provide an accounting of its facilities, fuel and weapons in return for what he called “political and economic compensation.” If the North Koreans meet the schedule and disable their equipment, it would be a major victory for the Bush administration, at a time when it is eager to claim progress on some diplomatic front to offset its problems in Iraq. Whether to offer the North rewards, including oil and, eventually, removal from the list of state sponsors of terrorism and diplomatic recognition, has been the subject of a six-year struggle within the Bush administration. But most of the hawks who have opposed such offers are now gone, and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has given Mr. Hill far more latitude to strike a deal, and to meet the North Koreans outside of “six party talks” — the discussions that have also included Russia, China, Japan and South Korea. Those talks are expected to resume in mid-September, and the weekend meeting was cast as a prelude to any agreement reached there. The hawks are still unhappy, and have suggested that Mr. Hill is giving away too much. “There is still simply no evidence that Pyongyang has made a decision to abandon its long-held strategic objective to have a credible nuclear-weapons capability,” John R. Bolton, the former American ambassador to the United Nations and, in President Bush’s first term, the top State Department official on counterproliferation, wrote in The Asian Wall Street Journal this weekend. “This inconvenient fact should make it impossible for the State Department to concede on other issues, even if it were inclined to do so,” he said. “Creative minds are therefore working on ways to explain that any forthcoming North Korean declaration of its nuclear capabilities is ‘full and complete,’ thus eliminating the remaining troubling obstacles to full normalization of relations.” When the Bush administration came into office, North Korea was still appearing to abide by a nuclear freeze that it had negotiated in 1994 with the Clinton administration. But that deal fell apart after the Bush administration accused the North of cheating on the agreement, purchasing uranium enrichment equipment from Abdul Qadeer Khan’s nuclear network, based in Pakistan. While Mr. Khan and his associates have confirmed they made such sales, it is unclear what, if anything, the North did with the equipment. Mr. Hill said yesterday that that question would have to be answered as part of any full declaration. American intelligence agencies said earlier this year that they were uncertain what progress the North had made with that program, if any. The North Koreans conducted a nuclear test last October, though it was not entirely successful. It is unclear how many other nuclear devices they have produced, though intelligence agencies have estimated that they may have the material for between eight and a dozen. The administration’s critics, including Mr. Bolton, have said it is almost impossible to imagine that the North would say how many weapons it had or where those weapons, or the fuel to manufacture new ones, were situated. So far, there is no agreement for an intrusive inspection system. Still, if the facilities at the Yongbyon nuclear plant are truly “disabled,” a term no one has yet defined, it would probably prevent the North from manufacturing new weapons and expanding its arsenal. Mr. Kim said yesterday that “we made it clear, we showed clear willingness to declare and dismantle all nuclear facilities.” Mr. Hill said that “we have to work out some of the details” on exactly what facilities would be disabled. “We will have a declaration in time to disable what needs to be disabled,” he said, adding that “for example, the Yongbyon reactor would have to be included.”

“Crossing the Line”tells of four American servicemen who defected to North Korea, with an emphasis on James Joseph Dresnok, a k a Comrade Joe, who became a privileged North Korean citizen and appeared in propaganda extolling Communism. Mr. Dresnok, a poor, abused orphan from Virginia, was already married when he deserted in 1962. He married twice more in North Korea — to a woman who was probably Romanian, then to the daughter of a Korean woman and a Togolese diplomat — and has three stunningly beautiful children there. Directed by Daniel Gordon, the movie is fussily photographed and edited, and it falters at critical moments, particularly during a court-martial trial when Mr. Dresnok’s fellow deserter Charles Robert Jenkins accuses him of beating him in captivity. The director dices Mr. Dresnok’s furious after-the-fact reaction into Oliver Stone-style flash-cuts rather than letting it play out. Mr. Dresnok, a drawling bear of a man, is interviewed at length. His cranky wit is amusing; his explanations for his decisions sound like an opportunist’s self-justification. But his compelling story and the plentiful high-definition video images of North Korean daily life (including scenes of the Dresnok family bowling) prove so fascinating that “Crossing the Line” is riveting anyway. Film buffs will want to see it for the section dealing with“Unsung Heroes,”an epic 1978 propaganda film starring Mr. Dresnok as a brutal American villain, the pet project of a powerful film buff named Kim Jong-Il. CROSSING THE LINE Opens today in Manhattan. Produced and directed by Daniel Gordon; in English and Korean, with English subtitles; director of photography, Nick Bennett; edited by Peter Haddon; music by Craig Armstrong, Sister Bliss and Heather Fenoughty; narrated by Christian Slater; released by Kino International. At the Cinema Village, 22 East 12th Street, Greenwich Village. Running time: 94 minutes. This film is not rated.

North Korea offered to declare all its nuclear weapons programs and disable them by the end of the year in return for energy aid, the South Korean nuclear envoy said, raising hopes for quick progress in international efforts to eliminate the North&#8217;s nuclear armament. The North Korean offer came only hours after the nuclear monitoring agency for the United Nations confirmed that the North had shut down all five of its declared nuclear facilities, as it had promised to do in a February agreement. That news gave an added push to a new round of six-nation talks with envoys from the United States, North and South Korea, China, Russia and Japan.

SEOUL, South Korea, June 22 —  The chief American nuclear envoy, returning from the first visit toNorth Koreaby a ranking United States official in five years,  said here Friday that Pyongyang  had assured him it was ready to shut down its main nuclear reactor and would ultimately disable it. In the course of a two-day trip, Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs, met with his counterpart, Kim Key-gwan, and Foreign Minister Pak Ui-chun. But  he said he did not seek a meeting with Kim Jong-il, the supreme leader. The fact that North Korea invited Mr. Hill suggested that it was ready to resume the stalled six-nation talks on ending its nuclear program. By dispatching Mr. Hill to Pyongyang, Washington demonstrated its willingness to treat North Korea as a serious partner in bilateral negotiations, a status it has craved but had often been denied by the Bush administration. Under an agreement reached in February, North Korea agreed to shut down its main nuclear reactor at Yongbyon after the return of $25 million in funds that had been frozen after Washington said they came from various economic crimes and trade in missiles and nuclear equipment. At a news conference on Friday, Mr. Hill said the North Koreans “indicated that they are prepared, promptly, to shut down” the reactor and  “also said they are prepared to disable the Yongbyon facility.” Despite the palpable optimism surrounding Mr. Hill’s visit, North Korea is still a long way from giving up its full stockpile of nuclear weapons. To date, the government has admitted only that it has produced plutonium for weapons at Yongbyon. But the Bush administration suspects it has purchased equipment for enriching uranium, opening a second pathway to making bombs. North Korea has denied having such technology. “I am coming away from this two-day set of meetings buoyed by the sense that we are going to be able to achieve our full objectives, that is, the complete denuclearization,” Mr. Hill said.  “But we are also burdened by the realization of the fact that we are going to have to spend a great deal of time, a great deal of effort and a lot of work in achieving these.” It was unclear how far Mr. Hill went in demanding that North Korea disclose whether it has a second, covert program of enriching uranium. “We discussed the need to have a complete list of all nuclear weapons programs,” Mr. Hill said, “and I would just say that all means all.” During the last high-level visit of a United States official, in 2002, Mr. Hill’s predecessor, James Kelly, confronted the North with evidence that Washington said pointed to a uranium enrichment program. In the ensuing confrontation, North Korea expelled United Nations nuclear inspectors, restarted the Yongbyon reactor and produced more plutonium. It conducted its first nuclear test last October. In the six-nation talks in February in Beijing, North Korea promised to shut down the  Yongbyon reactor by mid-April. To secure that deal, Washington had to agree to the release of the $25 million. Mr. Hill’s visit came shortly after the money was released to North Korea, which responded by inviting back the United Nations inspectors, who were expected in North Korea on Tuesday.

SEOUL, South Korea, Jan. 19 — The North Korean Foreign Ministry said today that it had reached a “certain agreement” with Christopher Hill, the lead American negotiator, during talks in Berlin this week over its nuclear arms program. But Mr. Hill’s version of events was different. While “we had very useful discussions” in Berlin, he said, as for the North Korean spokesman’s talk of an agreement, “I’m not really sure what he’s referring to.” Even so, the announcement seemed to be a sign that the next round of six-nation talks about the North’s nuclear arms could make significant progress. The talks, involving China, Japan, Russia and South Korea as well as the United States andNorth Korea, may restart in Beijing in the week of Feb. 5, the Yonhap News of South Korea reported today. Mr. Hill, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, met with his North Korean counterpart, Kim Kye Gwan, in Berlin on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Officials and experts in Seoul said that at those meetings, Mr. Hill probably elaborated on the proposals he made at the last round of six-nation talks in December, and fielded questions from Mr. Kim about them. Little progress was made at those December talks, the first to be held after the North conducted its first nuclear test in October. But analysts who follow the issue said that the North may be signaling through the Berlin talks and the North’s announcement today that it is ready to explore the American offer. No details of that offer have been released. For years, the regime in Pyongyang has wanted direct, one-to-one talks with the United States, which it regards as a necessary demonstration that it is taken seriously in Washington. But the United States has refused, saying instead that it would only negotiate with North Korea if the talks also included the South and other neighboring nations. Though American officials said the Hill-Kim meetings in Berlin were informal and meant to prepare for the six-nation talks, the meetings were nonetheless widely seen as a departure from Washington’s previous multilateral-only policy. Chon Hyun Joon, a North Korea expert at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, said the “certain agreement” may concern North Korea’s demand that Washington ease sanctions imposed on a bank in Macao, Banco Delta Asia, that holds deposits and handles transactions for the North Korean state. The Treasury Department has said that Pyongyang used the bank to launder and channel illicit money. The six-nation talks produced a broadly worded agreement in September 2005, with North Korea promising to abandon its nuclear weapons program in return for diplomatic recognition and economic benefits. But Washington and Pyongyang have  squabbled over details of the agreement, especially over the timing of the North’s promised actions to freeze and then dismantle its nuclear facilities under U.N. inspection and Washington’s promised financial and economic aid. The sanctions against the Macao bank have also been an obstacle to progress.

Heavy rains and floods have destroyed tens of thousands of acres of crops, threatening to worsen the country’s food shortage, the World Food Program said. The agency has said North Korea requires 5.5 million tons of food annually to feed its 23 million people but estimates the country can produce only about 4.5 million tons. Losses from the recent rains could lead to the loss of 100,000 tons of its own food, the agency said. It also said the floods had forced 60,000 people from their homes, most in South Pyongan Province. Last week, the official Korean Central News Agency reported that heavy rains had left hundreds of people dead or missing. No precise casualty figures were given.

North Korea approached the South about reopening the airspace hot line, severed in May following the sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean naval vessel.
==::==

==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — North andSouth Koreareopened one of the three severed hot lines between them on Monday in response to a request from the North, its first apparent outreach since the youngest son of the leader, Kim Jong-il, was unveiled as his successor. The reopened hot line connects the principal international airports — Pyongyang in the North and Incheon in the South — and a test call was conducted late Monday morning, the Unification Ministry said through a spokesman in Seoul. Another government official here said Monday thatNorth Koreahad approached the South about reopening the hot line, which was severed in May following the sinking of a South Korean naval vessel, theCheonan, in March. Relations between the Koreas have been badly strained since the Cheonan sinking, which killed 46 sailors. The South has blamed the incident on a North Korean torpedo attack; the North has denied any involvement. It was not immediately clear whether the renewal of the airspace hot line was an authentic diplomatic entreaty from the North or merely a matter of practicalities. Analysts continue to look for signs of a possibly new foreign policy approach from the North now that Kim Jong-un, Mr. Kim’s Western-educated son, has been given powerful posts in the military and the Workers’ Party. Commercial aircraft using South Korean airports were still avoiding North Korean airspace, said Lee Jong-joo, an official with the Unification Ministry, adding that the South Korean government was still considering whether to remove that ban. In May, the nuclear-armed North severed all three hot lines that connect the countries, which remain in a technical state of war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, and a formal peace treaty remains elusive. The principal hot line is located at Panmunjom, the so-called truce village on the highly militarized border. A South Korean government official on Monday described that link as “kind of the official one, used for all official messages.” The official said the North had “unilaterally shut down” that line in May and has not indicated if or when it might reopen. The North also closed down a naval hot line intended to prevent clashes near its disputed sea border with the South. That link, which remains closed, was established in 2004 after deadly naval skirmishes in 1999 and 2002. With the hot lines closed, communications between the two governments have been basically conducted through their jointly operated industrial park in Kaesong, located inside North Korea. The South Korean government does not have an official office at Kaesong, but diplomatic messages are routinely passed there.

North Korea seized a fishing boat in waters near the eastern sea border, the South Korean Coast Guard said.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreaseized a South Korean squidding boat in waters near their eastern sea border, the South Korean Coast Guard said Sunday, straining already high tensions between the two Koreas. The 41-ton  boat was believed to have been detained after entering the North’s exclusive economic zone, where foreign fishing boats are banned, the coast guard said in a statement. There was no immediate confirmation from North Korea that its forces had impounded the squidding vessel. But the North Korean government, angry over an ambitious South Korean naval exercise due to end Monday, had said it would respond with “strong physical retaliation” and had warned civilian vessels to stay clear of the maritime border between the two Koreas. Four South Koreans and three Chinese crew members were aboard the squidding vessel, the Daeseung 55. When South Korean fisheries authorities contacted a crewman on the boat by satellite phone on Sunday afternoon, he said that the boat was being towed to Songjin, a port on the eastern coast of North Korea, for interrogation of the crew. Then the communication was cut off, coast guard officials said. “Our government hopes for the safe return of our ship and crew according to international laws,” the coast guard’s statement said. Inter-Korean relations have plunged to their lowest point in years since a South Korean warship, theCheonan, was sunk in March, killing 46 sailors. A South Korean investigation attributed the sinking to a North Korean torpedo. The North has denied responsibility and called the accusation a justification for warmongering bySouth Koreaand its main ally, the United States. As part of the aftermath of the Cheonan attack, the South Korean military has been conducting a major naval exercise off of the west coast of the divided peninsula involving 4,500 troops and more than two dozen ships. In the years immediately following the 1950-53 Korean War, North Korea was accused of prowling into South Korean waters and kidnapping those on South Korean fishing boats. Hundreds of South Korean fishermen from those ships never returned home. Such episodes have become rarer in recent decades. But fishing boats from either side have occasionally drifted into the other’s waters, often after engine trouble. How fast they were released often depended on the tenor of bilateral relations at the time. The South Korean squid ship left Pohang, a port on the east coast of South Korea, on Aug. 1 and was scheduled to return to port on Sept. 10. It made its last daily radio report to the South Korean Coast Guard on Saturday evening.

A South Korean television network has accused North Korea of illegally showing matches from South Africa to its isolated populace.

SEOUL — As if they did not have enough things to disagree about,North KoreaandSouth Koreahave found one more: World Cup soccer. A South Korean television network has accused North Korea of illegally showing matches from South Africa to its isolated populace. North Korea’s state-run Central Television has shown replays of four World Cup games, including the opening match between South Africa and Mexico, and a Saturday match in which South Korea defeated Greece 2-0. The replay of the South Korea-Greece game was shown on Monday evening, with occasionally favorable commentary on the skills of South Korean players. The South Korean television network SBS said that it had acquired the sole right from the World Cup organizer, FIFA, to broadcast the games throughout the Korean Peninsula and that it was investigating whether North Korea has pirated its signals. North Korea’s taped replays did not carry the audio or graphics from the original footage, making it difficult to tell whose transmission it had copied. North Korea’s soccer team qualified for the World Cup this year for the first time since 1966, when it reached the quarterfinals. South Korea placed fourth in the 2002 World Cup, for which it and Japan were co-hosts. North Korea’s first match will be on Tuesday when it plays the 2002 champion, Brazil. North Korea’s coach, Kim Jong-hun, said in a news conference on Monday at Ellis Park stadium in Johannesburg, where the team will play Tuesday, that the match would be shown in his country. But he did not clarify whether it would be shown live. North Korea illegally used some South Korean coverage of the 2002 World Cup, but in 2006 it made an arrangement to obtain television coverage legally from a South Korean network. SBS said it had been negotiating with North Korea to pick up its signals, but the talks fell through amid mounting tensions over the March 26 sinking of a South Korean warship. A multinational investigation concluded that a North Korean torpedo had sunk the ship, killing 46 South Korean soldiers. The sinking has chilled the relationship between the two countries to its lowest point in years. The two countries bickered about the sinking on Monday at the United Nations Security Council, with the North accusing Seoul of fabricating the episode. Some activists from the South are said to be planning a protest inside the stadium over the sinking during the North Korean match. Even if North Korea has pirated SBS transmissions of this year’s games, there is really no way for the South to punish the North because since the ship sinking, the two countries have severed almost all official ties. In general, South Koreans think that exposing the isolated North to international sports events will help the country open up. Years ago, the South broadcast such events across the border as part of its propaganda campaign against the North.

South Korea and North Korea agreed Tuesday to hold talks this week, as South Korea launched its first rocket into space from its own territory.

SEOUL,South Korea— South Korea andNorth Koreaagreed Tuesday to hold talks this week focused on arranging reunions of families separated by the Korean War more than 55 years ago. The discussions would be the first joint meetings of Red Cross officials from both countries in two years, another sign that North Korea is shifting away from its provocations of South Korea and the United States. After its recent nuclear test and missile launchings, the North has made some conciliatory gestures, among them the release of two American journalists this month during a trip to North Korea by former President Bill Clinton. South Korean news reports said Tuesday that North Korea had gone further, inviting President Obama’s special envoy on North Korea, Stephen W. Bosworth, to visit Pyongyang, the North’s capital, for talks. But a potential irritant to better relations also surfaced on Tuesday, when South Korea launched a rocket into space from its own territory for the first time. The mission failed to put a satellite into its intended orbit, a South Korean official said, but the North had warned that it would “closely watch” whether the United States and its allies criticized the South the same way they denounced North Korea for launching a rocket of its own four months ago. The three-day Red Cross meeting is scheduled to begin Wednesday in southeastern North Korea, said Chun Hae-sung, the spokesman for the Unification Ministry in Seoul. If the two Koreas agree on a new round of family reunions, a selected number of Koreans from each side will be allowed to meet relatives they have never met or have not communicated with since the end of fighting in 1953. Before they were suspended, the highly emotional reunions were a powerful symbol of reconciliation on the divided Korean Peninsula and leverage for the impoverished North to extract good will and aid from the South. But the North broke off the visits after President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea, who has taken a harsher stance on the North compared with his recent predecessors, took office 18 months ago. JoongAng Ilbo, a daily newspaper in Seoul, reported Tuesday that North Korea had invited Mr. Bosworth and Sung Kim, Washington’s chief nuclear negotiator with the North, to visit Pyongyang. The Obama administration is seriously considering a trip next month, the report said, citing an unidentified high-level diplomatic official in Washington. The South Korean news agency Yonhap carried a similar report. If the American envoy, Mr. Bosworth, visits Pyongyang, it would be the first nuclear discussion between North Korea and the United States since Mr. Obama took office in January. Officials in the United States were not immediately available for comment, and the United States Embassy in Seoul said it would not comment. News reports and officials here also said Tuesday that when members of a high-ranking North Korean delegation met President Lee in Seoul on Sunday, they relayed a proposal from the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, to hold an inter-Korean summit meeting. But the office of President Lee insisted on Tuesday that there had been no discussion about an official proposal. Officials and analysts in Seoul and Washington were mulling over possible interpretations of the recent overtures from North Korea — whether the moves were intended for a genuine dialogue or a way for the North to derail a stringent enforcement ofUnited Nations sanctions. The United States led international efforts to tighten existing sanctions, and impose new ones, after the North’snuclear teston May 25. Over the years, North Korea has alternated betweenbrinkmanshipand conciliation. Each fresh round of talks, typically begun with high hopes, provided the North with aid but eventually disintegrated after only minor progress on the dismantling of the North’snuclear weaponsprogram. In between talks, the North has continued to raise the stakes by accumulating more nuclear fuel, conducting two nuclear tests and repeatedly testing missiles. If Mr. Bosworth visits Pyongyang, the North will fulfill its goal of opening direct dialogue with Washington. The United States has said it is willing to talk bilaterally with the North, but only within the framework of six-nation talks that also involve South Korea, China, Russia and Japan. North Korea insists that the six-nation talks are “dead.” On Tuesday, office buildings in central Seoul echoed with cheers as the rocket, Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1, or Naro-1, blasted off from South Korea’s space center on the central south coast. With China, Japan and North Korea  pursuing space programs, South Korea has been eager to have its own. But when the United States refused to help, for fear of encouraging a potential arms race in the region, South Korea turned to Russia. South Korea says that unlike North Korea, it has been pursuing its space program transparently, within the boundaries of its international commitments, not to develop and proliferate long-range missile technology.

For the residents of South Korean-controlled Yeonpyeong Island, which sits off the coast of a hostile North Korea, daily life requires living with fear.

YEONPYEONG ISLAND,South Korea— Sitting in front of his house, mending a fishing net with hands gnarled by years of pulling a living from the sea, Kim Sang-jin recalled the last time North and South Korea clashed militarily in the nearby Yellow Sea. It was seven years ago, and the gunfire from the warships in the two-hour naval skirmish was close enough to rattle his windows, sending him and his wife ducking for cover. Now, with tensions escalating since the North’s nuclear test last month and the subsequent United Nations sanctions, he said he and other residents feared a new battle could erupt at any moment near this small South Korean-controlled island, which sits precariously off the coast of a hostileNorth Korea. “We are always afraid, every day,” said Mr. Kim, 66, who lives two doors down from a neighborhood bomb shelter. “But you get used to living with the fear.” As a North Korean freighter suspected of carrying banned weapons heads toward Myanmar with an American Navy destroyer on its tail, the chances of a confrontation with the North — which has said it would consider interception an act of war — are rising. And South Korean military experts say that this lonely island, which is also claimed by the North, is the most likely place for that clash to occur, with the North possibly provoking a limited battle as part of its risky brinkmanship with the United States and other countries. Yeonpyeong Island sits just two miles from the so-called northern limit line, a watery extension of the demilitarized zone dividing the Koreas. It was the scene of two deadly sea battles in the past decade. South Korea has since dispatched the first of its newest class of “patrol killer” guided-missile ships, designed especially for the close-range naval skirmishes that have taken place in these waters. The ship, the Yoon Young-ha, was named after one of six South Korean sailors killed in the second battle, in 2002, which the North won. With that and the island’s garrison of some 1,000 marines on heightened alert, the South seems almost to be spoiling for a fight. At a recent ceremony to mark the 10th anniversary of the first of the two previous naval battles here, when the South said it bested the North by sinking 10 of its vessels, Lt. Cmdr. Kwon Young-il vowed that if the North struck again, “we will sink them.” Many of the island’s 1,600 civilian residents, mostly graying fishermen, said they felt caught in the middle. But they also say they are accustomed to the periodic escalations in tensions, which they describe as just another part of life on this disputed island. Most said they were determined to go about their daily work of running their crab boats or tending fish traps along the island’s rocky coast. “This is not the first time that North Korea has tested missiles and bombs,” said Kim Seung-ju, who heads the island’s branch of the national agricultural cooperative. “It doesn’t rattle us.” Indeed, with its concrete bunkers, tank traps and lines of trenches, the island seems like a cold war time capsule. Islanders conduct monthly air raid drills and keep gas masks in their homes. Posters at local restaurants warn residents to be on the lookout for North Korean spy boats and submarines. Since the nuclear test, the island has stocked its 19 civilian bomb shelters with fresh water and dried noodles. Visitors to the island are screened at the ferry landing by military police officers searching for North Korean agents. Though the island is just eight miles from the coast of North Korea, its only regular link to the rest of the South is a 66-mile, two-and-a-half-hour ferry ride. This makes the island an anomaly even in South Korea, which still faces the North across the heavily armed DMZ, but where some communities have begun dismantling their bomb shelters and tank traps. Many South Koreans seem eager to forget their belligerent neighbor to the north in a rush toward increasingly affluent living standards, even though the two Koreas have remained technically at war for more than a half-century. While it has been business as usual in most of South Korea during the nuclear standoff, the tension is noticeable in Yeonpyeong. In one potentially ominous sign, residents say many of the Chinese crab boats that annually fish these waters have left, though it was unclear if they had been warned off by North Korea or had simply gone home because the crab season was over. Still, some islanders and members of the military say the tensions are not as high as in the 1970s, when the North tried to claim the island and sent its jet fighters flying overhead. These days, the South seems much more confident in its material superiority over the impoverished North. “We have the technology,” said retired Lt. Gen. Kim In-sik, a former commandant of the South Korean Marine Corps, who visited the island recently to bolster troop morale. “But it is still possible the North will attack this zone to increase pressure” as part of its broader bargaining strategy against Seoul and Washington. Mr. Kim, the leader of the agricultural cooperative, said the islanders were ardently anti-Communist because many of them, including his  mother, fled the North during and after the 1950-53Korean War. At the same time, these ties to the North make him and other islanders feel that neither Korea wants another full-scale war. In fact, they said the dangers here were often overstated. Many islanders complained that the higher tensions have scared away tourists and brought phone calls from worried relatives asking why they insist on living in such a risky place. Some islanders even groused that the only invaders they had seen were the hordes of South Korean reporters and television crew members, who descend on them during every standoff with the North. “When we see the TV crews, we know something is going on,” said Park Choon-geun, 49, a crab-boat captain. “Otherwise, we think life is normal here.”

The action could anger the Communist regime while bolstering a joint front with the U.S. as the allies seek to punish the North for its recent nuclear test.

SEOUL,South Korea— South Korea imposed its first financial sanctions on North Korean companies, officials said Tuesday, taking a symbolic action that could anger the Communist regime while bolstering a joint front with the United States as the allies seek to punish the North for its recent nuclear test. North Koreacontinued its harsh rhetoric on Tuesday when the government-run newspaper, Minju Joson, warned that the regime can use its nuclear program not only for defense but also as “a merciless offensive means.” The escalating tensions began hurting investor sentiments. On Tuesday, a South Korean fur-coat maker became the first company to announce it was withdrawing from the Kaesong joint industrial complex in North Korea, a sign that deteriorating inter-Korean relations and tensions over the North’s recent nuclear test were jeopardizing the complex, once hailed as a model of future economic cooperation between the two Koreas. The financial sanctions against three North Korean firms, which became effective on June 1, were disclosed on Tuesday, a day after North Korea sentenced two American journalists to 12 years of hard labor for illegal entry and unspecified “hostile acts.” The families of the journalists, Laura Ling and Yuna Lee, urged North Korea to grant them clemency. “We remain hopeful that the governments of the United States and North Korea can come to an agreement that will result in the release,” the families said in a statement. American officials said that the harsh sentences were likely to be used as a negotiating ploy by the North as it tries to avoid new sanctions being worked out at the United Nations Security Council in response to the  nuclear test two weeks ago.  Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton stressed that the reporters’ case and Washington’s efforts to punish North Korea for its  nuclear test are “entirely separate matters.” Still, American officials appeared to be weighing whether to send a special envoy in a high-profile effort to seek the release of the two journalists. The two most likely candidates are former Vice President Al Gore, whose Current TV channel employs the two journalists, and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, who has visited North Korea several  times and helped negotiate the release of two Americans in the 1990s. Asked Monday if Washington will send an envoy, Mrs. Clinton said her government is “pursuing every possible approach” to win their release. On Tuesday, the Ministry of Strategy and Finance in Seoul said that it has banned trading with three North Korean firms  — Korea Mining Development Trading Corporation, Tanchon Commercial Bank, and Korea Ryongbong General Corporation  — and will freeze their assets.  But officials said that these firms have no trading with South Korea or assets in the South. The Security Council had earlier targeted those three North Korean entities when it reaffirmed financial restrictions against the North after its rocket launch on April 5. Until now, while voicing support for Security Council decisions, South Korea had avoided implementing such symbolic but politically sensitive sanctions for fear they would anger Pyongyang. That stance began shifting in May when South Korea announced it could search North Korean ships suspected of carrying weapons of mass destruction in its territorial waters as part of an American-led global arms embargo. Ms. Ling, 32, and Ms. Lee, 36, were arrested March 17 on the China-North Korea border. “There is a serious doubt that these journalists had a fair trial because the legal proceedings have not been transparent,” said Kay Seok, a Seoul-based researcher for Human Rights Watch. “It’s not clear whether the North Korean government has honored the defendants’ right to choose their own lawyers, and whether they had the benefit of courtroom translators.” Analysts in Seoul doubted that the journalists would spend time at one of the North’s notorious labor camps, where North Korean defectors said malnutrition and beatings were rampant. Rather, they said the journalists could be held at a “sanitized” prison that Pyongyang allowed international human rights officials to visit in the mid-1990s.

North Korea is more unstable and dangerous than people in the South realize. It is perhaps time for southerners to focus on their belligerent neighbors.

SEOUL — For most South Koreans, a North Korea that fires  missiles, threatens war and conducts a nuclear test or two is nothing new. That’s the North the South has lived with for more than half a century. So last month, while the rest of the world was captivated by   Pyongyang’s  belligerent words and actions, South Koreans were preoccupied with what was real news to them: the suicide and funeral of their late president, Roh Moo-hyun. But  they should be worried. Pyongyang’s belligerence is much stronger than before. It seems ready to take chances.  Internal factors, notably rising uncertainties about the succession of leadership, make Pyongyang more adventurous. The  development of a nuclear arsenal and other advanced weapons is not just a bargaining chip, it’s a serious effort to solidify the country’s leadership, which needs to show evidence of progress to its increasingly doubtful people. Nothing is more convincing than nuclear warheads mounted on long-range missiles that can reach its archenemy, the United States. There are increasing  conventional provocations as well. After the United States and other nations condemned the North’s nuclear and missile tests and threatened sanctions, Pyongyang sharply raised its hostile rhetoric toward the South. When the North  threatened to attack South Korean and U.S. shipping along the Northern Limit Line of the Yellow Sea, Chinese fishing boats in the region disappeared en masse. It is not clear whether they retreated at Pyongyang’s request, but the incident clearly raises tensions. The limit line, imposed by the U.S.-led United Nations after the Korean War, has been constantly challenged by the North. Why do these  threats fail to intimidate South Koreans? Partly, it is a case of  crying wolf. They have lived under the North’s threats for so long  that they have become almost numb to them. Older people are used to hearing warnings of war, so often used by past military rulers to justify or prolong their grip on power. Younger South Koreans are indifferent to the North’s  hostility  for different reasons. Not having experienced the Korean War, they often fail to see the true face of the North. Moreover, South Korea’s  economy ranks  13th in the world, and  they are increasingly sympathetic to their starving neighbors. Those who make rare trips to the North are often surprised by the pervasive malnutrition, which  has left northern soldiers skinny, frail and  seemingly unable to wage  war. For the past 10 years, South Koreans have  offered aid and emphasized brotherhood between the two Koreas. But even as they were shipping food and fertilizer to the North,  setting up factories there, hiring Northern workers, and  building luxurious tourist hotels,  Pyongyang never slowed its  military build-up. Huge amounts of South Korean aid were used  for  nuclear and missile tests. The North is now far ahead of the South in its military capabilities. The planned transfer of wartime command control from Washington to Seoul in 2012 will further weaken the South’s defense posture. Seoul hopes to beef up its own military power, but economic difficulties limit its spending on  advanced weaponry. All these are good  reasons to worry South Koreans. And  June is particularly a good month for South Koreans to remember the North’s unsavory side. It was in June 1950 that North Korean troops stormed over the border  to start the Korean War. Two  clashes since then  —  the Yellow Sea  battles of  1999 and 2002 that took several lives on both sides  —  also happened in June. Although the North is unlikely to wage an all out war on the peninsula at the moment, it could again test the world with small provocation along the DMZ or the Northern Limit Line. It is perhaps time for southerners to focus on their belligerent neighbors. The South’s lack of alertness  was precisely the reason why the North took chances in June 1950.

SEOUL,South Korea—North Koreasaid Friday that South Korea must leave a joint industrial park unless it unconditionally agrees to higher wages for Communist workers and other demands from the North. The two countries have run the complex in the border town of Kaesong since 2004, hoping that it will serve asa pilot project for economic integration. About 100 South Korean factories hire relatively cheap North Korean labor to make shoes, electronic parts and kitchen utensils there. But the project has been caught up in political feuding over the past year, as a new South Korean government has takena harder lineagainst the North, and the North has heightened tensions with Seoul. It remains unclear whether the North intends to force the shutdown of Kaesong through its demands, or whether the cloistered nation is merely seeking more money as the United Nations pursues tighter economic sanctions after the North’s April 5rocket launching. North Korea’s leaders have also grown wary of capitalist influence spreading to the rest of their tightly controlled society from Kaesong. On Friday, North Korea said it was nullifying all existing contracts on land use, taxes and wages at Kaesong. It said it had given “special favors” to the South Koreans at Kaesong at the first summit meeting between the two Koreas in 2000. The meeting led to economic aid to the North with no strings attached, a policy the current president of South Korea, Lee Myung-bak, wants to end. North Korea said Friday that it had no reason to continue the preferential treatment and was drawing up a new set of contracts. “The South Korean companies must unconditionally accept what we notify them. Or they are free to leave Kaesong,” said a statement carried by the North’s official news agency, KCNA. A South Korean government spokesman, Kim Ho-nyeon, said: “This fundamentally threatens the stability of the Kaesong complex, and it is not acceptable at all. If they follow through on their threat, they will have to take responsibility for all the consequences.” Earlier Friday, South Korea proposed talks for next week to discuss the fate of a South Korean worker detained in Kaesong on charges of denouncing the Communist government. During a brief discussion last month, North Korea refused to talk about the condition of the man, who has been held since March 30 without access to South Korean officials. The North instead began demanding higher wages for 39,000 North Korean workers at Kaesong, who are now earning about $75 a month.

South Korean snipers in a helicopter chased away pirates pursuing a North Korean freighter on Monday, in a rare instance of cooperation between the Koreas. The episode took place near the Yemeni port of Aden, according toSouth Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff. The pirate vessel gave up chasing the North Korean freighter after snipers aboard the helicopter prepared to fire warning shots, the South Korean military said in its statement. Relations between North and South  Korea have frayed since a conservative government in the South  took power last year with a vow to get tough on the North over its nuclear program.

SEOUL,South Korea—North Koreasaid Friday that it would reopen a military hot line with the South on Saturday ahead of the North’s widely expected missile launching  early next month. The line is the only telephone link between the Koreas. “North Korea sent us a message today saying that they will restore the communications line as of 8 a.m. Saturday,” said a spokesman for the Defense Ministry, who spoke on the customary condition of anonymity. North Korea hadstopped respondingto calls on March 9, at the start of annual military exercises by American and South Korean troops that the North denounced in a wave of belligerent language as preparations for an invasion. The exercises ended Friday. The North says it will launch a communications satellite into orbit between April 4 and April 8. Neighboring governments say the launching is a cover for testing the North’s ballistic missile technology. The United States, Japan and South Korea have repeatedly urged North Korea to cancel the launching. They say it violates a 2006 United Nations resolution that bans North Korea from ballistic missile activities. There was no word on Friday about two American journalists believed to have been detained by North Korean border guards on Tuesday morning. Laura Ling, a Chinese-American, and Euna Lee, a Korean-American, were reporting on conditions faced by North Korean refugees in China. Their Chinese guide, an ethnic Korean, was also detained.

South Korea lashed out on at a warning from North Korea that prompted South Korea’s two principal airlines to re-route some flights.

HONG KONG —South Korealashed out Friday at a warning fromNorth Koreathat appeared to threaten civilian planes traveling through the region. While hectoring comments are routinely made by the North, often in inflammatory language, the threat caused enough uncertainty that three airlines announced that they were rerouting some flights. Singapore Airlines said Friday that it would reroute flights passing through the North’s airspace. On Thursday, South Korea’s two principal airlines, Korean Air and Asiana Airlines, said that they would adjust the routes of some flights approaching South Korea from the east. The reroutings followed a statement on Thursday by the official North Korean news agency, KCNA, saying that “security cannot be guaranteed for South Korean civil airplanes flying through the territorial air of our side and its vicinity” while joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea, which begin Monday,  are under way. The exercises involve some 26,000 American troops, an unspecified number of South Korean troops and an American aircraft carrier. The North has condemned the exercises as preparation for an invasion. The United States and the South say they are purely defensive. South Korea’s Unification Ministry spokesman, Kim Ho-nyeon, said about 33 daily international flights passed over the North’s airspace from the east, about 15 of them South Korean carriers. “Threatening civilian airliners’ normal operations under international aviation regulations is not only against international rules but is an act against humanity,” Mr. Kim said. He said the North should “immediately withdraw the military threat.” The flare-up comes as Stephen W. Bosworth, the Obama administration’s special envoy for North Korea, is  to arrive in Seoul this weekend as part of an effort to restart talks overNorth Korea’s nuclear program. On Friday, North Korean and American military personnel met at the  demilitarized zone between North and South Korea for the second time this week. At the first meeting, on Monday, North Korea filed a complaint about the coming exercises. Despite the North’s warning on civilian aircraft, the American military said the exercises would proceed as scheduled.

Four North Koreans defected to South Korea by sea this week and the authorities in the South are questioning them, Seoul’s intelligence agency said.

SEOUL — Four North Koreans defected toSouth Koreaby sea this week and the authorities in the South are questioning them, Seoul’s intelligence agency said Wednesday. A spokesman for the agency, who spoke on condition of anonymity, gave no further details. But Yonhap, South Korea’s national news agency, reported that the defectors were a husband and wife, and their son and daughter-in-law. Yonhap, which cited no sources, said the four North Koreans were in a small wooden boat when a patrol boat from the South Korean Navy picked them up Tuesday night. Escapes fromNorth Koreathrough the heavily guarded land and sea borders between the two Koreas are uncommon. More than 14,000 people from the hunger-stricken North have defected to South Korea since the end of the Korean War in 1953, but most of the defectors have gone through China. On Oct. 28, a North Korean believed to be a soldier defected to South Korea, officials in Seoul said. The man reportedly defected at a South Korean military guard post. At the time, the North’s military was threatening an attack unless Seoul prevented anti-North Korean “provocations,” including the sending of airborne leaflets into the Communist North. In recent months, conservative activists in the South — mainly North Korean defectors supported by Christian churches — have been unleashing flights of balloons carrying leaflets into the North. The leaflets harshly criticize the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, and carry news about his reported  illness, a topic that is taboo in the North. Defectors from North Korea said on Dec. 22 that they had sent about 1.5 million propaganda leaflets over the border, ignoring the Seoul government’s appeal to stop. A group of defectors flew 26 large balloons carrying the leaflets toward North Korea from an island off the west coast of South Korea, said Lee Min-bok, head of the North Korea Christian Association in South Korea.

SEOUL,South Korea, Nov. 17 — The prime ministers of North and South Korea have announced a significant package of economic projects to help rebuild the North’s broken economy and ease military tension on the divided peninsula by increasing traffic across the demilitarized zone. At the end of three days of talks here on Friday,North Korea’s prime minister, Kim Yong-il, and his South Korean counterpart, Han Duck-soo, agreed to start cross-border freight-train service for the first time in more than half a century, scheduling the first, highly symbolic crossing a week before South Korea holds presidential elections on Dec. 19. Then, starting in the first half of 2008, fishing boats from the two Koreas will work together, the prime ministers said, in the same frontier waters where their navies engaged in a bloody skirmish in 2002. Also, the North will relocate its warships from Haeju, a naval base near the border, to make room for South Korean cargo ships and a new industrial complex to be built there by South Korean investors. Construction is to begin as early as next year. “These projects will chip away at the DMZ,” said Koh Yu-hwan, an expert on North Korea at Dongguk University in Seoul. “They are steppingstones toward what we hope will become a confederation of the two Koreas before eventual reunification.” The economic projects will cost South Korea $11.1 billion to $15.8 billion, according to Kim Young-yoon, a researcher at the government-run Korea Institute for National Unification. The two government leaders have huddled in Seoul since Wednesday to advance the rapprochement generated by a summit meeting in early October and the North’s decision to disable its nuclear weapons facilities. At the October meeting, PresidentRoh Moo-hyunand the North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, called for negotiations on a peace treaty that would formally end the state of war between their countries. The meeting this week was free of the kind of haggling common in Korean negotiations. Analysts said the two sides were bonded by a common desire to influence the December presidential election by strengthening South Korean liberals, who favor reconciliation and investment for the impoverished North. For North Korea, the talks provided a last opportunity to win major investment commitments from the South before Mr. Roh’s liberal government steps down in February. Some analysts noted that the meeting was significant for avoiding direct discussion of North Korea’s nuclear weapons, the focus of international sanctions. “It is really disappointing to the international community that the prime ministers of the two Koreas meet for the first time in 15 years, but their agreements didn’t raise a peep about North Korea’s nuclear weapons programs, a major international security threat,” said Nam Joo-hong, a North Korea expert at Kyonggi University.

Leaders of North and South Korea sat down face-to-face today in the first summit meeting between the two Koreas in seven years.

==::==
SEOUL,South Korea, Oct. 3 — Leaders of North and South Korea, both compelled by urgent yet different motives to make high-risk wagers, sat down face-to-face today in the first summit meeting between the two Koreas in seven years. Flanked by four senior aides on national security and economic affairs, President Roh Moo-hyun of South Korea faced the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, across a large rectangular table at a state guest house in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. Mr. Roh was eager to lay out South Korean plans to helpNorth Korearebuild its impoverished economy if Mr. Kim agrees to arms cuts and denuclearization. Mr. Kim — whose public image as a recluse belies his negotiating skills and grasp of international developments that could affect the fate of his isolated regime, analysts say — stunned TV watchers in South Korea by showing up with a single aide, his main intelligence chief. On Tuesday, when Mr. Kim gave an unsmiling reception to Mr. Roh, he managed to generate intense speculation in Seoul that he was not enthusiastic for a deal with the lame-duck South Korean president, who leaves office in February. Today, Mr. Kim turned the mood around, flashing smiles and chatting, according to South Korean pool reports. In a gesture that was interpreted in the South as a measure of his seriousness, he asked Mr. Roh to extend his three-day visit to Pyongyang by a day but later reports suggested the talks are still expected to end on Thursday as scheduled. Mr. Kim broke the ice today by asking Mr. Roh, “Did you sleep well, president?” Mr. Roh, whose bluntness made as many political enemies as friends at home, told Mr. Kim that he was “much concerned about” this summer’s floods that killed hundreds of North Koreans; floods have been a recurring problem for the North and have symbolized Mr. Kim’s inability to feed his country’s people without outside help. At the guest house, Mr. Kim scanned gifts from Mr. Roh: a traditional folding screen, a tea set and a bookshelf packed with DVDs of South Korean TV dramas, movies and documentaries. Mr. Kim, a movie buff with his own film library, once kidnapped a South Korean movie director and his actress wife to the North and has written books on how to make movies. The two leaders entered formal talks after posing before a large mural that showed sea waves crashing on a bluff. Mr. Kim wore his trademark khaki zip-up jumpsuit and spoke with both elbows on the table, occasionally making gestures with both hands. The morning session lasted two hours and the talks were “deep and substantial,” said Mr. Roh’s spokesman, Cheon Ho Seon. The two leaders were to meet again in the afternoon. This week’s summit is only the second time leaders of the North and South have met since the Korean peninsula was divided after World War II, and expectations run high. South Korea says peace and shared prosperity with the North will be the overriding themes of the three-day meeting between the two nations, which remain technically at war after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a temporary cease-fire. Mr. Roh hopes his summit will lay the ground for launching negotiations for a peace treaty formally concluding the war. Such an agreement will require the two Koreas to pull back their massive armed forces from their volatile border, and will need the approval of the United States and China. Both parties to the war — Washington and Beijing — want to see North Korea first stripped of its nuclear weapons before such a peace treaty is granted. Mr. Roh has powerful incentives for Mr. Kim: large joint economic projects to revive the North’s crumbling command economy. But Mr. Roh also cautioned that he was not too ambitious, saying that he would try to make the summit meeting “calm and practical.” Rather than grand statements, his aides said, Mr. Roh may aim for concrete economic and military tension-reducing projects that would gradually nudge the North toward economic openness — the only viable option the South sees for the future of the divided Korean Peninsula. “Even if we do not reach an agreement in many areas, it would still be a meaningful achievement to narrow the gap in understanding and to enhance confidence in each other,” Mr. Roh said before his departure for Pyongyang.

The three-day visit will mark only the second time a South Korean president has met with his North Korean counterpart.

SEOUL,South Korea, Oct. 1 — As PresidentRoh Moo-hyunof South Korea prepares to walk across the world’s most heavily armed border Tuesday to discuss the future of the divided peninsula with the North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, there is both doubt and optimism about how useful their meeting will be. “How to make peace take root on the Korean Peninsula will be the top-priority agenda item for the summit,” Mr. Roh said today in a speech marking Armed Forces Day, a day South Korea has historically observed by emphasizing the Communist North’s military threat and vowing to build up its own army. The three-day visit by Mr. Roh to the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, will mark only the second time a South Korean president has met with his North Korean counterpart. His aides said that the president would take the rare opportunity to explain his “vision for the future of the Korean Peninsula,” calling for the scaling down of armed deployments massed along the border and the creation of a “joint economic community” as a prelude to reunification. Mr. Roh will be the first South Korean president to walk across the border, a symbol of Cold War hostility. His predecessor, Kim Dae-jung, took a plane to Pyongyang for the first inter-Korean summit meeting in 2000. From the border, Mr. Roh’s motorcade will proceed to Pyongyang, a highly unusual occurrence in the North, which makes vigorous efforts to keep its hungry populace and its desolate countryside from the view of outsiders. “In this, we read the North’s gaining confidence in opening up,” said Lee Kwan-sei, the South Korean deputy unification minister. The meeting will bring together two high-stakes gamblers. With only four months left in office, the unpopular South Korean president seeks to bolster his legacy and achieve a diplomatic breakthrough his critics say could help swing votes in the December presidential election to a liberal candidate, one who would carry on his policy of engagement with the North. For Mr. Kim, it is a last chance to obtain a massive economic aid package from Mr. Roh’s liberal government before the election, when polls suggest it is likely to be replaced by a conservative administration. For policy makers outside the peninsula, the summit meeting will test not only how serious Mr. Kim is about ending the North’s nuclear weapons program, but also how aggressively South Korea will use economic incentives to push Mr. Kim in that direction, analysts said. “If the North Korean nuclear problem is resolved, we will have no shortage of ideas to cooperate withNorth Koreato improve its economy,” said a senior aide to Mr. Roh, speaking on condition of anonymity. Mr. Roh’s trip reflects South Koreans’ wish to take the initiative in shaping the peninsula’s destiny and resolving what they consider to be the fundamental source of tension there: the unfinished Korean War. The three-year conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, in 1953, leaving the two Koreas still technically at war. Younger South Koreans tend to believe that peace was delayed on the peninsula partly because Washington refused to engage the North until recently. That sentiment was summarized by former President Kim, Mr. Roh’s political mentor, when he said in Washington last month: “The Korean people want their opinions to be taken into full account when the U.S. implements its policies toward North Korea, and as such, some critical views have been expressed toward the Bush administration’s former stance.” South Korea hopes the meeting will pave the way for a four-way forum among the two Koreas, the United States and China, all parties to the Korean War, to negotiate a peace treaty to replace the armistice. At the same time, it wants to implant special economic zones in the North, not only to improve its people’s living standards but also to bind the North’s economy to the South’s vastly larger one. There is growing concern in the South that North Korea is falling under the economic influence of China, its main Communist ally. Mr. Roh will have to press North Korea for tangible progress toward denuclearization and win concessions on major human rights issues, like the fates of hundreds of South Koreans believed to have been kidnapped by the North. Otherwise, any deal involving large economic incentives for the North will probably backfire with a South Korean electorate that has become more skeptical of North Korea since its missile and nuclear tests last year. Such a deal would also intensify Washington’s belief that South Korean generosity, with no strings attached, helps North Korea stonewall on the nuclear issue. On the eve of his departure for Pyongyang, Mr. Roh received good news from Beijing, where negotiators at North Korea’s disarmament talks today tentatively agreed to a draft plan on disabling its nuclear facilities by the end of the year. The draft agreement — after further consideration by the six governments in China, the United States, Japan, Russia and North and South Korea — could be released in time for the inter-Korean summit, Seoul officials said. Critics, including South Korea’s conservative political opposition, say that the meeting is being held at the wrong time, before North Korea actually disables its nuclear facilities, and in the wrong place, in that Kim Jong-il has yet to keep his promise, made in 2000, to come to a summit meeting in Seoul. But Mr. Roh believes progress in inter-Korean relations and the six-party nuclear talks can “go hand in hand.” Given the North Korean power structure, which gives Mr. Kim’s words the ultimate authority, the summit meeting gives Mr. Roh a rare opportunity to challenge him to clarify his intentions about his nuclear programs. In inter-Korean negotiations, the higher the level of talks have been, the higher the chances for major breakthroughs. Meanwhile, Mr. Kim faces massive challenges, too. International sanctions crippled an important source of cash for his government by squeezing its arms sales, drug trafficking and other illicit activities. After having recovered slowly since 1999, the North’s economy shrank again last year, by 1.1 percent, according to the South Korean government. The summit meeting gives the reclusive North Korean leader a chance to step into the public spotlight and make a gesture of good will toward Washington, at a time when the Bush administration appears more willing than ever to improve ties with the North once it drops its nuclear development. “Kim Jong-il’s ultimate strategic goal is to improve relations with the United States, and he may not want to lose this good opportunity,” said Kim Yeon-chul, a political scientist at Korea University. “Time is not really on North Korea’s side.”

North Korea said it would halt reunions of separated families with South Korea. The North said the South had refused to discuss humanitarian aid at high-level talks last week, seeking instead to address North Korea’s missile and nuclear programs. The North brushed off that subject as irrelevant. The reunions have been a main element of reconciliation efforts since the only summit meeting between leaders of the North and the South in 2000, bringing together more than 16,300 Koreans for tear-filled meetings of several days.

Mr. Jo paid a rare good-will visit to Washington in 2000 as Kim Jong-il&#8217;s special envoy and met with President Bill Clinton.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) —  Jo Myong-rok, a top North Korean military official who traveled to Washington in 2000 on an unusual goodwill mission, died Saturday. He was 82. Mr. Jo, who was vice marshal of the Korean People’s Army and held the No. 2 post on the powerful National Defense Commission behind the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, died of heart disease, the official Korean Central News Agency reported from the North Korean capital, Pyongyang. Mr. Jo paid the rare visit to Washington in October 2000 as Mr. Kim’s special envoy and met with President Bill Clinton. He also later pledged to Madeleine K. Albright, Mr. Clinton’s secretary of state, thatNorth Koreawould take steps to improve relations in the interests of peace and security. He was the highest-level North Korean official to visit Washington, and his trip —  followed by Ms. Albright’s landmark visit, at his invitation, to Pyongyang — was part of North Korea’s efforts to keep up the momentum generated by a breakthrough meeting between Mr. Kim and South Korea’s president, Kim Dae-jung, earlier that year. Mr. Jo arrived at the State Department for his meeting with Ms. Albright dressed in a dark business suit. But for his talks at the White House, he changed into full military dress, complete with a high-brimmed cap —  a change of outfit that suggested he wanted to project a tougher line in talks with the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger. The reconciliatory mood between the wartime foes shifted after  George W. Bush became president and took a tougher line against North Korea. Relations have also been strained overNorth Korea’s nuclear weaponsprogram, and North Korea and the United States still do not have formal diplomatic ties. The North Korean news media said Mr. Jo was born into a peasant family in Yonsa County in North Hamgyong Province; served as a pilot during the Korean War, which North Korea refers to as the Fatherland Liberation War; and later became chief of staff and commander of the air force of the Korean People’s Army. Reports about Mr. Jo’s public activities had been infrequent in recent years, sparking speculation about his health and a possible change in the North’s power structure. His death comes amid a succession movement in North Korea, which has been ruled by the Kim family since President Kim Il-sung founded the nation in 1948.

SEOUL, South Korea — Workers’ Party delegates from acrossNorth Koreawere converging in Pyongyang, the country’s state media reported on Monday, as children and soldiers there rehearsed a celebration for their country’s biggest political gathering in 30 years. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, is believed to be preparing the rare meeting of party representatives to enforce what was expected to be the biggest overhaul of leadership since the party held its last congress in 1980. Observers of North Korea were eager to learn whether Mr. Kim would install his third son and  presumed successor, Kim Jong-un, in important party posts, thus making public an intention to take his family’s dynastic rule of the reclusive nation to a third generation. Officials and analysts in South Korea agree that Mr. Kim is grooming his son,believed to be in his late 20s, as his heir. But they differ over whether the son will acquire top party posts in this meeting and, if he does, how soon the leadership will make his appointments public. North Koreapreviously saidit would hold the party meeting early this month to elect the top leadership of the Workers’ Party. Although there has been no official word on the dates of the conference, registration for the convention appears to have begun. Representatives from provinces and towns were gathering in Pyongyang, the capital, for a meeting that would “mark a meaningful chapter in the history of our party,” the state-run daily newspaper Rodong Sinmun said in a commentary on Monday. The commentary was posted onUriminzokkiri, a Web site run by the North Korean government. Troops recently moved to Pyongyang, apparently for a military parade, the South Korean Defense Ministry said. It took the outside world years to learn details of Mr. Kim’s secretive climb up the party hierarchy in the 1970s. His ascent became clearer when he was given senior party jobs at the 1980 party congress. He officially took over in 1994, when his father, President Kim Il-sung, died of heart failure. Good Friends, a rights group based in Seoul that claims to have sources inside North Korea, said on Monday that delegates’ registration began Saturday for a two-day party conference that starts Wednesday. In a separate development, North Korea said Monday that it would release a South Korean fishing boat and its crew, amid signs that the South might allow humanitarian aid shipments to the North. A South Korean squid boat and its seven crewmen — four South Koreans and three Chinese — will be handed over to the South on Tuesday, according to the North’s state-run news agency, K.C.N.A., and the South Korean government. The North Korean Navyseized the boaton Aug. 8. North Korea later said it was fishing illegally in its exclusive economic zone off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula. Despite the ship’s “intolerable infringement” of its sovereignty, North Korea decided to return the crew with its boat “from the compatriotic and humanitarian points of view,” K.C.N.A. said. The crew also admitted its wrongdoing, the agency said. The North’s gesture, a marked contrast with its recent anti-South Korean invective, came as South Korean officials indicated that they might approve requests by humanitarian groups to send rice to the victims of recent floods in North Korea. The South Korean Red Cross had offered last month to ship $8.5 million in supplies to help the flood victims. The Unification Ministry in Seoul said Tuesday that North Korean officials had said they wanted rice and equipment to reconstruct buildings damaged by the floods.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreaon Sunday rejected an invitation from the American-ledUnited NationsCommand to hold talks on the sinking of a South Korean warship three months ago, which a multinational investigation has attributed to the North Koreans. After that investigation was completed, South Korea accused North Korea of torpedoing the ship, theCheonan, which killed 46 South Korean sailors and led to a sharp escalation of tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Both the South Korean and American governments consider the attack a grave violation of the armistice that halted the 1950-53 Korean War. The United Nations Command, which oversees the implementation of the armistice, proposed talks with North Korea. On Sunday, North Korea called the proposal “ridiculous.” “The U.S. forces side should no longer meddle in the issue of the North-South relations under the name of the ‘U.N. Forces Command,’ ” North Korea said in a statement carried by its state-run Korean Central News Agency. The Foreign Ministry added Monday that “continuing hostile U.S. policy and its military threat” have raised the need for North Korea to bolster its “nuclear deterrent” in a new, improved manner, the Associated Press reported. North Korea has denied involvement in the sinking and called the multinational investigation that concluded the North Koreans were responsible a fiction concocted by enemies bent on war. North Korea also has warned that any international attempt to punish North Korea for the Cheonan sinking would be considered a hostile act. On Sunday, the North reiterated an earlier demand that South Korea accept a visit by North Korean military inspectors to review and dispute the multinational investigation, which included experts from the United States, Britain, Australia and Sweden. South Korea rejected such an inspection, urging the North to make its case at the armistice talks. For years North Korea has rejected armistice talks. Instead, it demanded bilateral talks with the United States to negotiate a peace treaty that would formally end the Korean War. The United States has sought to increase the pressure on North Korea in response to the Cheonan sinking. On Saturday, President Obama said the United States would retain control of all military forces in the South during a conflict.

Regarding “The larger struggle” by David Brooks (Views, June 16): The struggle is not between democratic capitalism and state capitalism, but rather within democratic capitalism itself.  As Andrei Sakahrov explained over 40 years ago in his essay “Progress, Coexistence and Intellectual Freedom,” there are things to be learned from the various political systems. Today the United States and Europe are struggling with change. The question is whether policymakers can rise above the commercial lobbies to get the balance right. Without that change, I see an inchoate scramble of views and parties financed by the commercial rat pack J.H. Faulkner,Carnoules, France North Korea and the World Cup I doubt any Koreans in the United States would cheer for North Korea’s World Cup soccer team. Just like the Russian, Baltic and Ukranian exiles during the cold war cheered for the U.S. hockey team when it played the Soviets in the 1980 Olympics, few, if any, ethnic Koreans, will support a team whose national leaders starve, torture, imprison and kill those of their own blood. Before somebody says politics and sports are separate matters, let’s remember that politics (China’s entry into the Korean War) is the only reason there are two Korean states today, and that there’s even a North Korean team to begin with.

North Korea issued a New Year’s message that highlighted the reclusive country’s attempt to readjust the focus of six-party nuclear disarmament talks.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreacalled on Friday for an end to “the hostile relationship” with the United States, issuing a New Year’s message that highlighted the reclusive country’s attempt to readjust the focus ofsix-party nuclear disarmament talks. In an editorial carried by its major state media outlets, North Korea said that its consistent stand was “to establish a lasting peace system on the Korean Peninsula and make it nuclear-free through dialogue and negotiations.” The editorial added that “the fundamental task for ensuring peace and stability” was “to put an end to the hostile relationship” with the United States. The sequence of easing tension  with Washington, establishing a peace regime and then denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula has been shaping up as the North’s policy approach before it re-engages in talks about giving up itsnuclear weapons, according to officials and analysts in Seoul. The North’s new emphasis on that policy sequence proved to be a stumbling block when President  Obama’s special envoy on North Korea policy,Stephen W. Bosworth, visited the North’s capital, Pyongyang, last monthto try to persuade North Korea to return to the six-nation talks about its nuclear program. The six-party format began in 2003, and the talks focused mainly on dismantlingNorth Korea’s nuclear weaponsfacilities. The participants are the two Koreas, the United States, China, Russia and Japan. Washington and its allies have provided North Korea withfood aidand other assistance while offering  incentives such as security guarantees, normalized ties and a peace treaty. The talks dragged on for years, but  the North dismantled only some  of its nuclear facilities. Amissile test by North Korea in April 2009led to a swift United Nations condemnation, whereupon the North quit the six-party talks, saying they were “useless.” The next month, North Korea conductedits second nuclear test,which led to a United Nations Security Councilresolutionand a further tightening of  sanctions. North Korea now insists on separate, bilateral talks with the United States as a way to defuse the hostile relations. DuringMr. Bosworth’svisit, North Korea acknowledged a possible role for the six-nation talks but did not say when it would resume them. The 1950-53Korean Warended in a truce, not a formal peace treaty, leaving the peninsula technically in a state of war. North Korea says it has built nuclear weapons as a deterrent to an American invasion, although Washington has said it has no intention to attack. Although they recognized the need for a permanent peace treaty to replace the truce, officials in Washington and Seoul fear that the North’s demand for peace talks may be a ploy to distract the focus on ending North Korea’s nuclear weapons programs. After having accumulated enough plutonium for several bombs, North Korea declared last year that it had embarked on an uranium-enrichment program that would give it a second route to  atomic weapons. If peace talks begin, North Korea will likely demand normalized ties, significant  food and energy aid and even the pullout of American troops from South Korea as a precondition for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula, according to analysts in Seoul. North Korea traditionally marks New Year’s Day with a joint editorial by the country’s three major newspapers representing its ruling party, the military and the youth militia. Politicians, scholars and diplomats from the outside world scrutinize the lengthy statement for clues to the regime’s policies for the coming year. This year’s editorial softened the typically bellicose attacks against Washington and President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea. “Unshakable is our stand that we will improve the North-South relations and open the way for national reunification,” it said, calling on Mr. Lee to honor his predecessors’ agreements to send aid to North Korea. Mr. Lee, a conservative, maintains that no significant aid is possible until he sees progress in the ending of North Korea’s nuclear ambitions. The impoverished North, apparently staggered by the United Nations sanctions that were tightened in May, also stressed the need to improve the people’s standard of living by accelerating the development of light industry while calling for efforts to boost foreign trade. “The agricultural sector,” it added, “should sharply increase the grain output.”

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreasaid Tuesday that it had detained an American citizen who the government said had  illegally entered the reclusive country from China. The brief dispatch by the North’s official news agency, K.C.N.A., did not identify the person, who it said was under interrogation by the authorities. It said the intruder crossed the river border into North Korea on Thursday. An American missionary from Tucsonentered North Koreafrom China on Friday. The missionary, Robert Park, 28, had said he intended to persuade the North’s leader, Kim Jong-il, to release political prisoners and that he hoped to get arrested to bring attention to his cause, according to human rights activists in Seoul. It was not possible to determine whether the person arrested by the North was Mr. Park. Mr. Park was carrying a Bible and a letter urging the Mr.  Kim Jong-il to release all political prisoners from the country’s notorious concentration camps, the activists said. “I am coming here to deliver God’s love,” he said as he crossed the frozen river border, according to Jo Sung-rae, head of Pax Koreana, a conservative civic group based in Seoul. “God loves you.” Before leaving Seoul for China on Wednesday to enter North Korea, Mr. Park said he wanted to be arrested to help bring international attention to the North Koreans’ suffering, South Korean activists said. He said he did not want to be released until the North shut down its prison camps, they said.

South Korean rights advocates, bloggers and Christian pastors say the two reporters needlessly endangered North Korean refugees and the activists who help them.

SEOUL, South Korea —Laura LingandEuna Lee,the two American journalists released after nearly five months in North Korean custody, have been widely portrayed at home as victims of unduly harsh punishment by a repressive government for simply doing their job. But here in South Korea, human rights advocates, bloggers and Christian pastors are accusing them of needlessly endangering the very people they tried to cover: North Korean refugees and the activists who help them. The accusations stem from a central fear repeated in newspapers and blogs here: that the notes and videotapes the journalists gathered in China before their ill-fated venture to the border fell into the hands of the authorities, potentially compromising the identities of refugees and activists dedicated to spiriting people out of the North. The Rev. Lee Chan-woo, a South Korean pastor, said the police raided his home in China on March 19, four days after the journalists visited and filmed a secret site where he looked after children of North Korean refugee women. He said that he was then deported in early April and that his five secret homes for refugees were shut down. The children, he said, were dispersed to family members in China, who could not afford to take care of them. “The Chinese cited scenes from films confiscated from the journalists when they interrogated me,” said Mr. Lee, 70. As evidence of the ordeal, he provided documents he said the Chinese police gave him after the raid. “The reporters visited our place with a noble cause,” he added. “I did my best to help them. But I wonder how they could be so careless in handling their tapes and notebooks. They should have known that if they were caught, they would suffer for sure, but also many others would be hurt because of them.” The Rev. Chun Ki-won, the chief pastor of the Durihana Mission that Mr. Lee works with, said that two of the women interviewed by the American journalists fled China after being told about the arrests, frightened of being repatriated toNorth Koreaand put in labor camps. Another interviewee was still on the run in China, he said. “We could not find out whether they filmed any other refugees we don’t know of,” Mr. Chun said. “If that’s the case, we have to find them, provided it’s not too late already. But the American reporters are not talking to us.” Many elements of Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee’s reporting trip remain shrouded in mystery. Neither their employer,Current TV, nor the journalists have revealed details of their work or the circumstances under which they were captured. Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee were arrested by North Korean soldiers on March 17, while their cameraman,Mitch Koss, and their guide were reported to have been detained by the Chinese authoritiesafter fleeing. Brent Marcus, a spokesman forCurrent TV, said, “We’re concerned about the situation that has evolved with Lee Chan-woo and the Durihana Mission.” But he said “many of the details” in the pastors’ accounts were “not correct.” When Ms. Lee and Ms. Ling have recovered enough to tell their story, he said, it will differ from the pastors’ versions. E-mail messages to Ms. Lee and a representative who has been handling public relations for the reporters’ families were not answered. According to Durihana, the Current TV crew met with Mr. Chun, the chief pastor, in Seoul on March 13, asking for help covering the plight of North Korean refugees in China. Mr. Chun said he put them in touch with Mr. Lee and a Korean guide in China. On March 15, the crew met Mr. Lee in Yanji, a Chinese town near the northeastern border with North Korea, he said, but seeming lapses in security bothered him. For one, he said, they called his home telephone in Yanji — a serious breach of protocol for activists who operate under the constant fear of being monitored by the Chinese police. The activists, missionaries and smugglers who help shuttle people out of North Korea have moved about 20,000 North Korean refugees through China, mostly to South Korea. Some operate with a political agenda to undermine the North Korean government, and some are driven by religious passion to convert North Koreans to Christianity. Mr. Lee said the American crew asked to visit one of five secret homes where he looked after 20 children, ages 5 to 13. They were the children of North Korean women who had been lured by human traffickers with promises of food and then sold to Chinese men, he said. Mr. Lee said he first asked the journalists not to film the children. When they assured him that they would obscure parts of the footage, like faces, Mr. Lee said he relaxed a bit. But he said he did not know until later that the crew asked children to face the camera and speak to their mothers, whom they had not seen for a long time. “After they left,” he said, “the children told me excitedly about being filmed.” The cameraman, Mr. Koss, declined to answer specific questions about the trip until Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee had spoken first. Still, he said, he was amazed by “how many untrue stories have been published in the last five months” and how “when there is silence, fantasy answers to fill in empty spaces.” But here in South Korea, where the dangers of the China-North Korea border zone are well known, the American journalists’ venture has been criticized by many as foolhardy. “We can assume that the journalists’ guide compromised every source,” said Joo Sung-ha, a North Korean defector who works in Seoul as a newspaper reporter. In his blog, Mr. Joo has berated the American reporters, urging them to “shed their martyrdom image.” In a separate interview, Mr. Joo said he was also “disgusted” by the way “some American media are giving them some kind of hero’s welcome home.” “Since their return,” he added, “they haven’t said a peep about the fate of the people they have endangered, though unintentionally.” One human rights official in Seoul, who makes frequent excursions to China to interview North Korean refugees and whose work requires anonymity, complained: “I had to suspend my own trips and work in China because of the tension” created by the episode. Mr. Chun, the chief pastor, also raised concerns that the events might discourage future reporting on refugees. “Getting arrested and repatriated to the North is almost an everyday event for these poor refugees,” he said. “The difference is that they don’t get the kind of attention the American journalists did.”

The United States will try to win cooperation from China and other neighbors of North Korea for enforcement of sanctions that concentrate on financial dealings.
==::==

WASHINGTON — Hoping to give more teeth to international sanctions againstNorth Korea, the Obama administration has named a senior diplomat to lead a task force coordinating Washington’s political, military and financial measures against its government. The diplomat, Philip S. Goldberg, will travel soon to China and other countries to drum up support for the sanctions, which are aimed at strangling North Korea’s access to the international financial system and its shipments of missile and nuclear parts, administration officials said Friday. “Now we have some very powerful tools, and the challenge is to make effective use of them,” said one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the administration had not detailed its plans. But he acknowledged, “It’s going to take time to actually have a bite.” The United States has yet to test the more sweeping sanctions passed by theUnited Nations Security Councilagainst North Korea two weeks ago. However, a Navy destroyer currentlytrackinga North Korean freighter in the South China Sea, near Hong Kong, could provide the first test. Officials say the ship is suspected of carrying cargo banned by the United Nations. But American officials have been tight-lipped about whether they plan to intercept the ship, and there is a widespread belief among experts that it is easier, and less risky, to punish the North by going after its money rather than its ships. North Korea has said it will consider interdiction an act of war. The administration is focusing much of its efforts on freezing assets and cutting off financial flows that support North Korea’s trade in weapons, missiles and nuclear technology. These efforts are being led by Stuart A. Levey, an under secretary of the Treasury, who was one of the few senior members of the Bush administration to be held over byPresident Obama. The appointment of Mr. Goldberg is intended partly to head off the kind of turf battles that have grown out of Mr. Levey’s actions. For example, in 2005, the Treasury Department moved against an obscure bank based in Macao that handled transactions for the North Korean government, a campaign widely regarded as one of the most successful efforts to squeeze the North. But later, when the State Department was trying to negotiate with North Korea over its nuclear program, the Treasury sanctions against the bank proved to be an irritant, and difficult to unwind. Mr. Goldberg’s primary task, another administration official said, would be “to make sure there is broader interagency coordination,” not just between the State Department and the Treasury, but also the Pentagon, the Commerce Department and the Department of Homeland Security. Mr. Goldberg recently served as ambassador to Bolivia. He was expelled last fall by President Evo Morales, who accused him of supporting rebellious groups. In the 1990s, he was an adviser to Richard C. Holbrooke on the Dayton peace negotiations to end the war in Bosnia. “We wanted somebody who woke up every morning and thought about nothing but sanctions implementation,” the official said. Among his biggest challenges, officials said, will be persuading China to be rigorous in enforcing the sanctions. North Korea experts say there is little evidence, based on export statistics, that the Chinese went forward with the last set of economic measures. China has also shown little appetite for boarding North Korean ships. Even the United States  is not eager to be the first to demand to inspect the freighter, the Kang Nam 1, some officials said. The freighter is believed to be headed to Myanmar, a route that would take it past Singapore, which has pledged to inspect North Korean ships and may provide the first test of the sanctions. “Countries have greater latitude to board ships, but there are plenty of loopholes,” said Marcus Noland, an expert on North Korea at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. He added that China could pose equal problems for North Korea by restricting the North’s planes from its airspace. “In some ways,” Mr. Noland said, “it goes back to China and how enthusiastically they are going to implement the sanctions.”

North Korea’s sentencing of two American journalists to 12 years of labor further complicates Washington’s standoff with Pyongyang.
==::==
2009-06-09T00:00:00Z
==::==
WASHINGTON —President Obamaand his top national security aides on Monday urgedNorth Koreato release “on humanitarian grounds” two American journalists sentenced to 12 years of hard labor for entering North Korean territory. But administration officials  said that the  harsh sentences were  likely to be used as a negotiating ploy by  the North as it tries to avoid new sanctions in response to its nuclear test two weeks ago. In public statements, administration officials frequently referred to the two journalists as “young women” who might have inadvertently crossed the North Korean border, and urged North Korea to return them to their families. “Their detainment is not something that we’ve linked to other issues, and we hope the North Koreans don’t do that, either,” Robert Gibbs, Mr. Obama’s press secretary, told reporters on Monday afternoon. Clearly, the sentencing on Monday ofLaura Ling, 32, andEuna Lee, 36, to serve in North Korea’s famously brutal labor camps — where stories of starvation, overwork and mistreatment are legion —  greatly complicated the Obama administration’s agenda. The administration has been working at the United Nations Security Council for a series of new sanctions that would both cut off funds to North Korea and interdict cargo, to search for missiles, weapons or nuclear technology. Administration officials appeared to be weighing whether to send a special envoy in a high-profile effort to seek  the release of the two women, who were detained by North Korean soldiers at the Chinese border on March 17. The two most likely candidates are former Vice President Al Gore, whoseCurrent TVchannel  employs the two journalists, and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, who has visited North Korea a number of times  and arranged the release of another American 15 years ago. But the White House declined to talk about that option, and Mr. Gore has largely kept quiet, perhaps in hopes of not hardening the North’s position. Mr. Richardson said it was too early for Mr. Obama to send a personal representative. “Talk of an envoy is premature, because what first has to happen is a framework for negotiations on a potential humanitarian release,” Mr. Richardson told NBC News. “What we would try to seek would be some kind of a political pardon.” American officials said they feared that  any discussions with the North about the release of Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee could get caught up in the Byzantine politics of succession in the North Korean capital. In recent weeks, there have beennumerous reportsthat  the leader, Kim Jong-il, has settled on his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, as his successor, a step that the North Korean military and China, North Korea’s reluctant patron, are believed to oppose. In the first public confirmation of the younger Kim’s apparent selection, Kim Jong-il’s oldest son told a Japanese television station Saturday that all questions about the country’s recent nuclear test would have to be referred to “my father or my brother now, not me.” Speaking in English, he repeated essentially the same answer when asked about his father’s potential successor, though he suggested he had first heard the news from the Asian news media. The older son, Kim Jong-nam, is widely believed by analysts and American intelligence agencies to have been passed over because of his appetite for gambling and women. It probably did not help his reputation in that regard when Japanese cameras caught up with him in Macao, the former Portuguese colony near Hong Kong known for casinos and money laundering. Kim Jong-nam ended the interview by declaring, “I’m not involved in political affairs in North Korea.” In California, the home state of both Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee, the news of their sentencing was met with a mixture of dread and hope that the end of the legal process could actually mark the beginning of a settlement. “The 12 years just hits home, and make it more real,” said Marcus Marquez, who attended high school with Ms. Ling in Fair Oaks, a suburb of Sacramento, and has known her for more than 20 years. Raised in a modest middle-class home in the shadow of her more famous journalist sister, Lisa Ling, Ms. Ling was studious and friendly, according to Mr. Marquez. He said that she had seemingly grown more confident and ambitious in her reporting in recent years, including a story just before her arrest about thedrug warin Mexico. Lisa Ling told ABC that the two journalists were working on a story about the trafficking of North Korean women into China when they were detained, but other reports said they were reporting on North Korean refugees. The exact circumstances of their arrest remain unclear. The families of the two journalists said in a statement Monday that they were “shocked and devastated by the outcome of their trial.” If the women wandered into North Korean territory, the families said, they apologized on their   behalf “and we are certain that they have also apologized.” The human rights group Amnesty International criticized the procedures behind the sentencing and called for the journalists’ immediate release. “No access to lawyers, no due process, no transparency: the North Korean judicial and penal systems are more instruments of suppression than of justice,” said Roseann Rife, Amnesty International’s Asia-Pacific deputy director. The sentencing comes at a time of heightened tensions between the North and the United States. On April 5, the North launched a rocket in what was widely believed to be a test of its long-range Taepodong-2 missile, and in late May it conducted its second nuclear test in less than three years. The United Nations Security Council is weighing tougher sanctions against the country and the possible interdiction of North Korean ships suspected of carrying unconventional weapons. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said in an interview Sunday that the United States was examining a request by lawmakers to restore the North to the list of nations branded as sponsors of terrorism. But the State Department did everything it could on Monday to argue that this was unlikely. There is little evidence that North Korea has sponsored acts of terrorism in recent years, which led the Bush administration to de-list the country.

Facing the first direct challenge to his administration by an emergingnuclear weaponsstate,President Obamadeclared Monday that the United States and its allies would “stand up” toNorth Korea, hours after that country defied international sanctions and conducted what appeared to be its second nuclear test. Mr. Obama reacted to the underground blast as White House officials scrambled to coordinate an international response to a North Korean nuclear capacity that none of his predecessors had proved able to reverse. Acutely aware that their response to the explosion in the mountains of Kilju, not far from the Chinese border, would be seen as an early test of a new administration, Mr. Obama’s aides said they were determined to organize a significantly stronger response than the Bush administration had managed after the North’s first nuclear test, in October 2006. Speaking in the Rose Garden after returning to the White House from Camp David and meeting with his top aides in the Oval Office, Mr. Obama vowed to “take action” in response to what he called “a blatant violation of international law” and the North’s declaration that it was repudiating past commitments to dismantle its nuclear program. But as they had meetings every few hours — including a lengthy session in the Situation Room on Monday evening — some of Mr. Obama’s aides acknowledged that the administration’s options were limited. Much depends, they said, on the new president’s ability to persuade Russia and China to go significantly beyond the strong condemnations that they issued Monday against North Korea, their former ally and a vestige of cold-war communism. “I think we were all impressed with the fact that the Russians and the Chinese denounced this so strongly,” Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama’s chief of staff, said in a telephone call. Yet turning that into effective action will prove a challenge. Efforts by the Clinton administration to entice the North to halt its weapons program by providing it with oil and nuclear power plants, and by the Bush administration to push the country to collapse and then to try to seize its leaders’ assets, all failed. So did Mr. Bush’s second-term  strategy reversal, when he alienated hard-liners in his  administration by reaching a deal with the North to dismantle its main nuclear plant, a step the North began last year. In recent months, the North has renounced the accord and taken the first steps to restart operations and manufacture more plutonium for bomb fuel. Now Mr. Obama must decide how to mix what he called “stronger international pressure” with a new set of diplomatic overtures at a moment when, his aides are acutely aware, Iran and other nations are taking his measure, examining the confrontation with North Korea for hints of how he will handle complex confrontations to come. While Mr. Obama delivered aMemorial Dayspeech and then took the afternoon off to play golf, aides tried to sift through the sparse data to determine exactly what abilities North Korea had proved, if any. Initial seismic readings showed  the blast  at Kilju, exactly where North Korea conducted its 2006 test, was “a several kiloton event,” according to one senior administration official. If that judgment is correct, the test yielded a somewhat bigger explosion than the 2006 test, which was later judged a partial fizzle. But it will take days or weeks of testing radioactive particles vented into the atmosphere to calculate the size of the device, and even then there will be continuing debate about whether the North has the engineering ability to make a weapon compact enough to fit in the warhead of a missile, much less to deliver it to a target. The White House said that on Monday evening Mr. Obama called the leaders of the two strongest American allies in northeast Asia, President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea and Prime Minister Taro Aso of Japan, promising that he would press for  “concrete measures to curtail North Korea” and vowing an “unequivocal commitment” to the defense of both countries. While hardly unexpected, that statement was considered an important signal by American officials who are eager to tamp down any nervousness among Asian allies about whether a new and untested president is willing to face down a regime that has been defying Washington since  Eisenhower was in the Oval Office. But as Japanese and South Korean officials acknowledge, they are less concerned about a direct attack from the North — which would almost certainly result in a devastating, American-led response — than about North Korea selling its twice-tested nuclear weapons technology on the black market, much as it has sold missile and reactor technology in the Middle East. “We’re back to the same problem Bush had,” one intelligence official said. “The threat is not that they will shoot off a nuclear weapon; it’s that they will sell nuclear material.” In emergency conference calls after the North gave less than an hour’s notice through its mission to the United Nations that it would conduct a test early Monday, Mr. Obama’s team agreed on some preliminary strategy. One senior administration official said that the United States would never grant full diplomatic recognition to North Korea, or sign a peace treaty formally ending the Korean War, unless its nuclear capability is dismantled. To devise a common response, administration officials began planning to meet with Asian leaders, and eventually with the central player in the diplomatic drama: China. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates will begin the effort this week on a previously scheduled trip for an annual defense meeting, and his spokesman, Geoff Morrell, said, “There is simply no greater security challenge facing Asia than a nuclear-armed North Korea.” He said Mr. Gates would work “to figure out how we collectively can prevent that from becoming a reality.” Outside experts say it is probably a reality already. A C.I.A. assessment concluded that North Korea had built one or two nuclear weapons during the administration of the first President Bush, and in the spring of 2003, while the United States was focused on Iraq, the North expelled inspectors and harvested the fuel for six or more weapons. The second Bush administration said it would never “tolerate” a nuclear North Korea, but by the time it left office, none of that fissile material had been recovered. Perhaps the most powerful untapped sanction available to Mr. Obama and his allies is contained in aUnited Nations Security Council resolutionpassed after the 2006 test. It authorizes the United States and other nations to halt and inspect shipping into and out of North Korea for  contraband missile parts or nuclear materials. The sanction has never been enforced, partly because of concerns that it could escalate hostilities with North Korea, the poorest and least predictable state in Northeast Asia. When asked whether Mr. Obama would seek to intercept North Korean shipping, a step that could paralyze the country’s trade, a senior administration official said, “That’s getting ahead of ourselves.” Another senior official, however, said, “Other than having the Chinese cut off their oil, it might be the only step that would show them we are serious.” The calculation about how hard to press the North is made more complex by doubts about who is making decisions in Pyongyang. Kim Jong-il, whom North Koreans call the Dear Leader, appeared to have suffered a debilitating stroke last year. Mr. Kim reappeared recently, looking gaunt, thin and greatly aged, but intelligence officials say they believe he is again making day-to-day decisions. Nonetheless, they say, a succession struggle has begun. In the past, the two countries most cautious about pushing  North Korean leaders to change course were China and Russia, so it was significant on Monday that when work began at the Security Council on a new resolution, both appeared to support stiffer penalties, after having blocked steps in that direction after the North’s test of a missile in April. The Russians were surprisingly adamant. Vitaly I. Churkin, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations, said that the world had to face down threats to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which many view on the brink of collapse, and the still-unapproved Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

SEOUL, South Korea — AsNorth Koreaprepares to launch as early as Saturday what it calls a rocket carrying a communications satellite but Washington calls an intercontinental ballistic missile, the world is watching. And watching, for now, seems to be about all it can do. On Thursday, as CNN reported that North Korea had begun fueling the rocket — a strong indication that the launching would take place as scheduled, between Saturday and Wednesday — President Obama and his South Korean counterpart, Lee Myung-bak, agreed on the need for a “stern, united” international response. But with two American journalists detained and facing criminal indictment in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, the United States all but ruled out the possibility of shooting down the rocket — an action that, if successful, could provoke the North into quitting already sputtering nuclear disarmament talks and, if not, would embarrass the Pentagon. Japan sent interceptor missiles to the coast facing the North. But like the United States, it admits that it can intercept only if the rocket fails and tumbles toward its territory. “We will surely win,” the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, said during his recent birthday party, according to the March 28 edition of Rodong Sinmun, Pyongyang’s main state-run newspaper. Rodong then explained Mr. Kim’s tactic: “If our sworn enemies come at us with a dagger, he brandishes a sword. If they train a rifle at us, he responds with a cannon.” Among North Korea watchers, Mr. Kim’s tactic is known as “brinkmanship.” It is a term they often use to explain politics behind the North’s rocket launching and itsdetentionand impending indictment of Laura Ling and Euna Lee, both reporters of San Francisco-basedCurrent TV, who were arrested by North Korean soldiers at the border with China on March 17. The collapse of the Communist bloc in the early 1990s left North Korea with few friends. Since then, North Korea, a dictatorship armed to the teeth but unable to feed its own people without foreign aid, has specialized in provoking the international community for survival. Whenever it failed to get concessions in negotiations or there were changes of governments abroad, the North raised tensions, wangling an invitation to talks and extracting fresh aid while never giving up its trump card, itsnuclear weaponsprogram. That is what it did when it withdrew from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty in 1993 and began stockpiling plutonium; when itheld an American for three monthsfor illegally crossing its border from China in 1996; when it tested its first ballistic missile over Japan in 1998; when its warships clashed with the South Korean Navy in 1999 and 2002; and when it tested its first nuclear device in 2006. These movements forced reluctant governments in Washington and Seoul to the negotiating table for talks that often resulted in more aid to North Korea. In return, North Korea agreed to work toward ending its nuclear program — a promise it quickly stalled or reversed. It had to, experts say, because the nuclear card is its only major bargaining chip. North Korea was forced to recalibrate its strategy again after Mr. Lee, a conservative,came to power in Seoula year ago, ending a decade of no-strings-attached largess from the South. Meanwhile, Mr. Obama took office in Washington in January, giving Mr. Kim a reason to grab Washington’s attention anew. Since last year, the North has called Mr. Lee a “traitor” and his aides “pro-American flunkies” and “malicious confrontational maniacs.” It has cut off dialogue with Seoul and stalled six-nation nuclear disarmament talks. A month ago, it began assembling what Washington believes is its Taepodong-2 missile at a launching pad on its northeast coast. Then an unexpected bonanza for the Pyongyang government rolled in in the persons of Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee. The regime is now preparing to put them on trial on charges of “hostile acts” against the Communist state, a crime punishable by up to 10 years of hard labor in one of the North’s notorious prison camps. “The journalists considerably weakened their government’s leverage against the North,” said Kim Tae-woo, a North Korea expert at theKorea Institute for Defense Analysisin Seoul. All in all, Washington has few good options, experts said. “North Korea has little to lose in this game,” said Kim Yong-hyun, a North Korea specialist at Dongguk University in Seoul. “It’s a repeating pattern: Once again, North Korea’s brinkmanship is working.” Washington says that the launching is a provocative test of a ballistic missile with the potential of carrying a warhead to the western coast of the United States, and that it violates a United Nations resolution that bans the North from all such tests. But an American effort to punish the North at the Security Council will bog down in  haggling with China, the closest the North has to an ally, over whether the North is entitled to launch a satellite, analysts said. Any such move by the United States, North Korea warns, will also compel it to quit six-party talks on ending its nuclear weapons program — Washington’s top goal in dealing with North Korea. South Korea, too, has few ways to pressure the North, except perhaps reducing the $1.8 billion worth of annual trade, the second largest volume of trade the isolated country has after China. But the South is perpetually divided between those who want to discipline the North and those who fear such a tactic would only worsen its isolation and add to the deprivation of their relatives still living there. Tokyo has made the fate of a dozen Japanese kidnapped by North Korea an overriding priority in dealing with the North. Although popular, that policy has seriously curtailed Tokyo’s flexibility to engage the North in the nuclear and missile disputes. Mr. Kim is said to have suffered a stroke last August. By confronting the United States and Japan, he wants to enhance his credentials as a military leader as he seeks to get himself re-elected by his rubber-stamp Parliament, which convenes next Thursday, analysts said. The two American journalists provide North Korea with convenient leverage to attract a high-level envoy from Washington after  the rocket launching. But for now, the North will focus on the successful launching, which will give the necessary lift to Mr. Kim’s domestic reputation. “If the launch does take place, the best outcome for the international community is simply for it to fail,” said Daniel Pinkston, an analyst with theInternational Crisis Group, a Brussels-based policy group.

North Koreasaid Wednesday that it would elect new members to its rubber-stamp legislature on March 8, a move delayed for several months amid speculation about the leader Kim Jong-il’s health. The government also appointed at least five new ministers to economic posts in its cabinet, in what analysts said was an attempt to revive the nation’s economy after losing South Korean aid amid frayed ties. Analysts said the decision to have the elections, typically held every five years, was a sign that Mr. Kim’s health had improved after he reportedly suffered a stroke in mid-August. Parliamentary elections are a formality because candidates are picked by Mr. Kim and the governing Workers’ Party of Korea.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) —North Koreahas stuck to its promise and has begun taking steps once again to dismantle its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon under an agreement it reached with the United States last weekend, the State Department said Friday. “The North Koreans have in their efforts reversed all their reversals in the reactor,” said Sean McCormack, a State Department spokesman. “All the seals are back on, the surveillance equipment is back, reinstalled, and the equipment that had been removed is back where it had been.” The North Koreans have also removed more nuclear fuel rods from the reactor, Mr. McCormack said. “On the reactor, they have actually gone beyond where they were prior to their reversing the disablement steps,” he told reporters, adding that 60 percent of the fuel rods had been taken out of the reactor. However, he said the North Koreans had more to do in their fuel reprocessing facility. “They have not yet gotten to that baseline where they were,” he said, although there has been progress on this part of the agreement, too. The United States removed North Korea from its terrorism list  last weekend after the North agreed to a compromise plan to let American and other inspectors verify that it was adhering to its promises to dismantle its nuclear weapons program. The verification measures have to be formally agreed on by North Korea, South Korea, the United States, Russia, Japan and China — the six nations seeking to settle the dispute overNorth Korea’s nuclear program.

The American envoy, Christopher R. Hill, declined to indicate whether he had made progress in salvaging a fragile disarmament deal with North Korea.

WASHINGTON — An American envoy returned to the South Korean capital on Friday after three days of inconclusive talks withNorth Korea, while Bush administration officials said the North’s government was continuing to take steps toward restarting its nuclear weapons program. The envoy,Christopher R. Hill, told reporters that he had held “detailed and very substantive” talks in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, but he would not say whether he was satisfied with the outcome. He said he still had to brief Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who was traveling to Kazakhstan on Friday. Mr. Hill has been seeking to salvage a fragile disarmament deal that the Bush administration had hoped would stand as a major part of its legacy. But the accord has been threatened since last week, when North Korea broke the seals placed by United Nations inspectors on its equipment at its nuclear complex in Yongbyon and said it was restarting a facility to manufacture bomb-grade plutonium. In Washington, Robert Wood, a State Department spokesman, said the North Koreans “continue to take some steps to reverse disablement in some of the Yongbyon facilities.” Before Mr. Hill left this week for the North, senior State Department officials portrayed the trip as a last-ditch effort to save the deal. “This is it,” one senior administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity under normal diplomatic rules. The official said he believed that if the United States and North Korea failed to iron out their differences, matters might have to be kicked to the next administration. But on Friday, State Department officials were taking a different tack. They noted that Mr. Hill was leaving his deputy in Seoul, with possible plans to return to Pyongyang for more talks in the next few days, and said they remained hopeful that the deal might yet be salvaged. The North was supposed to be dismantling its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon as part of the agreement, which was announced with fanfare in June and was followed by North Korea’s public demolition of a cooling tower there. Any resumption of nuclear work at Yongbyon would violate the terms of that pact. North Korea has complained that the United States has not made good on its promise to remove North Korea from a list of state sponsors of terrorism, as President Bush announced in June that he was prepared to do, and instead has made new demands. One of those would require North Korea to accept a strict and intrusive verification system before the United States would carry out reciprocal steps. To break that impasse, Mr. Hill this week proposed a new approach that would give China, as close an ally as North Korea has at this point, a more prominent role in verification efforts. Under one idea, administration officials said, North Korea would submit a list of its nuclear sites to China, rather than to the United States, though it would still have to permit inspections from American as well as Chinese officials. It remains unclear whether North Korea accepted that proposal. “We were discussing all phases of completing phase two,” Mr. Hill said, “including and especially the issue of verification.” He declined to say whether he had made any progress. “I don’t want to talk about progress, and I don’t want to talk about specific issues,” he said. “I just want to tell you there were lengthy, detailed discussions. And I need to brief my boss on precisely what those discussions are, so that she can make decisions about our next step.”

North Korea asked for seals and surveillance cameras at a nuclear reprocessing facility to be removed.

PARIS —North Koreaasked theInternational Atomic Energy Agencyto remove seals and surveillance cameras at the North’s nuclear reprocessing facility, the agency’s director said Monday, in a setback for both the Bush administration and an international nuclear disarmament agreement. The move, following reports that the North Korean leaderKim Jong-ilmay be seriously ill, offers further proof that North Korea plans to renew activity at the facility that separates plutonium for use in nuclear weapons at its complex at Yongbyon. It further suggests that the country may be preparing to restart its nuclear weapons program. North Korea has “asked the agency’s inspectors to remove seals and surveillance equipment to enable them to carry out tests at the reprocessing plant, which they say will not involve nuclear material,” the agency’s director, Mohamed ElBaradei, said in a speech to the group’s 35-country board of governors. He confirmed that the agency’s inspectors had observed the restoration of some equipment that North Korea had previously removed during the dismantling process. In a telephone conversation with President Hu Jintao of China on Sunday, President Bush expressed concern about North Korea’s announcement last week of its intention to restore the nuclear facilities at Yongbyon to their original state, according to the White House. “The two presidents agreed that they would work hard to convince the North to continue down the path established in the six-party talks toward denuclearization,” the White House spokesman, Gordon D. Johndroe, said on Monday. China is North Korea’s main ally and provides the reclusive state with food and fuel. The United States, Russia, Japan, China and South Korea have been engaged with North Korea in tortured negotiations, which produced an agreement in February 2007 for North Korea to abandon its nuclear activities in exchange for aid and diplomatic incentives. Christopher R. Hill, the administration’s chief negotiator in talks over the nuclear program, described North Korea’s action as “a rough-and-tumble moment” and suggested that its defiance could be related to the health of Mr. Kim. “The six-party process has had its difficult moments in the past, and we’re certainly experiencing another one now,” Mr. Hill told reporters in New York, where President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice arrived for the opening of the United Nations General Assembly. Despite North Korea’s request to the I.A.E.A., Mr. Hill said he did not expect “any dramatic developments in a matter of days,” indicating that a resumption of nuclear production could be weeks or months away. “I don’t think there’s any immediate potential for restarting the things,” he said, “but obviously these reports are ones that we take very seriously.” Since last November, North Korea had been dismantling the nuclear complex, where it had been manufacturing fuel for nuclear weapons under the complicated disarmament-for-aid agreement. But last month North Korea announced that it had stopped dismantling its nuclear facilities to protest the failure of the United States to fulfill a promise to remove it from its list of state sponsors of terrorism. North Korea seemed to harden its position on Friday, saying that it no longer wanted to be removed from the list. “We can go our own way,” a Foreign Ministry official was quoted as saying. Officially, Washington has said that it will remove North Korea from the list after it permits inspectors to verify claims about its production of nuclear weapons. Arms control experts listed a number of possible reasons  North Korea was threatening to resume its nuclear program. North Korean officials may  believe that they can do so  without suffering major penalties, the experts say, gambling that the Bush administration is too distracted to react. Or Mr. Kim’s poor health may  be giving hard-liners greater maneuvering space. The experts also say that the move by North Korea is dangerous because the reprocessing of nuclear fuel from spent fuel rods can begin within months. It would take years, by contrast, for North Korea to produce fresh nuclear fuel if it decided to restart its nuclear reactor, which is also at the complex at Yongbyon. “This is a dangerous, step-by-step degradation of the nuclear agreement,” said David Albright, a former weapons inspector who now heads the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security. “North Korea may see it as part of a negotiation. But it’s a provocative act.” In another development, Dr. ElBaradei  said  Monday that the United States and other countries should share intelligence documents with Iran that accuse the country of suspicious past nuclear weapons activity. “I call upon member states which provide the agency with documentation related to the alleged studies to authorize the agency to share it with Iran,” Dr. ElBaradei said. In a report this month, the agency criticized Iran for failing to provide its inspectors with documentation, information and access to experts to clear up questions about nuclear activities that date back years. Iran claims that the documents, most of them from American intelligence sources, are forgeries and that the charges are “baseless.” Iran has demanded access to the documents, which the agency either does not have in its possession or does not have the authority to provide. Under the terms of a “work plan” negotiated more than a year ago with the agency, Iran agreed to a series of deadlines to resolve questions about its past nuclear activities. But the most sensitive accusations — about the suspected military aspect of its nuclear program — hinge on the intelligence documents. The United States, France and Britain will seek new sanctions against Iran at the United Nations because of its failure to comply with Security Council resolutions requiring it to suspend its production of enriched uranium, which can be used to produce electricity or to fuel weapons.

VIENNA—North Koreahas asked theInternational Atomic Energy Agencyto remove seals and cameras from its main nuclear complex, the agency’s chief said Monday. North Korea said on Friday that it was working on restarting the Yongbyon complex, the center of its atomic bomb program, which it had been dismantling under a much delayed disarmament-for-aid deal with five countries. North Korea asked the agency’s inspectors Monday to remove seals and surveillance equipment to enable them to carry out tests at the reprocessing plant, Mohamed ElBaradei, the agency’s director, told a meeting of the I.A.E.A. Board of Governors. Last month, North Korea said it planned to restart Yongbyon because the United States had not removed it from its terrorism blacklist. Early this month, North Korea made minor but initial moves to restart the plant, U.S. officials said. “Agency inspectors have observed that some equipment previously removed by North Korea during the disablement process has been brought back. This has not changed the shutdown status of the nuclear facilities at Yongbyon,” Mr. ElBaradei said. Diplomats have said that such a restoration would take at least several months. “I still hope that conditions can be created for North Korea to return to the Non-Proliferation Treaty at the earliest possible date and for the resumption of comprehensive safeguards,” Mr. ElBaradei told the closed meeting in Vienna. North Korea’s Foreign Ministry had said that work was under way to restore Yongbyon’s facilities “to their original state.” Washington has said it will remove the country  from the terrorism list once North Korea allows inspectors to verify claims its government made about its nuclear arms production.

The decision to take North Korea off the list of state sponsors of terrorism was a victory of the State Department over the Department of Defense.

WASHINGTON — Two days ago, during an off-the-record session with a group of foreign policy experts, Vice President Dick Cheney got a question he did not want to answer. “Mr. Vice President,” asked one of them, “I understand that on Wednesday or Thursday, we are going to de-listNorth Koreafrom the terrorism blacklist. Could you please set the context for this decision?” Mr. Cheney froze, according to four participants at the Old Executive Office Building meeting. For more than 30 minutes he had been taking and answering questions, without missing a beat. But now, for several long seconds, he stared, unsmilingly, at his questioner, Steven Clemons of the New America Foundation, a public policy institution. Finally, he spoke: “I’m not going to be the one to announce this decision,” the other participants recalled Mr. Cheney saying, pointing at himself. “You need to address your interest in this to the State Department.” He then declared that he was done taking questions, and left the room. In the internal Bush administration war between the State Department and Mr. Cheney’s office over North Korea, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and her top North Korea envoy, Christopher R. Hill, won a major battle against the Cheney camp when President Bush announced Thursday that he was taking the country he once described as part of the “axis of evil” off the State Department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism. The administration sought to portray the move as a largely symbolic, reciprocal move, made in return for North Korea’s long-delayed declaration of its nuclear program to the outside world. It is the first step in what will be a long, drawn-out diplomatic process that is meant to lead eventually to establishing a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. North Korea also said that it would blow up the cooling tower of its nuclear plant at Yongbyon on Friday, and it has invited news organizations to watch the event. North Korea probably has the fuel for several nuclear devices, according to United States intelligence estimates, but after the ambiguous result of its one test detonation, its nuclear status remains murky. North Korea declared that it had slightly more plutonium than it had previously admitted. But the declaration falls short of the full accounting that the administration had sought, since it omits any information about North Korea’s suspected efforts to enrich uranium, or the extent of any of the North’s sharing of technology around the world. Thursday’s announcement intensified a pitched battle in Washington, where Democrats and many foreign policy experts said the administration had dithered too long before reaching this deal, allowing North Korea to acquire enough plutonium to make several nuclear weapons. From the other side of the fence, conservative hard-liners complained that the United States gave away too much for too little, and should have adopted a more absolutist approach with the secretive North Korean government. Speaking to reporters, National Security Adviser Stephen J. Hadley conceded that the administration had decided to accept incremental progress with North Korea instead of its previous all-or-nothing strategy. He said the notion that North Korea would quickly acquiesce to all of Washington’s demands “was probably unrealistic.” Even so, many critics of Mr. Bush noted that the administration’s turnaround on North Korea did not come about until after North Korea exploded its first nuclear device in October 2006. Mr. Hill and Ms. Rice subsequently persuaded Mr. Bush that North Korea’s nuclear test had changed the rules of the game enough that the president should complete an agreement with North Korea and four other countries that led to Thursday’s declaration. Accusing the North Koreans of violating a previous diplomatic accord on ending its nuclear program, called the Agreed Framework, which was negotiated during the Clinton administration, Mr. Bush pulled out of talks with North Korea in 2002 and pressed to isolate the North Korean government. The abandonment of talks gave North Korea greater leeway to produce plutonium and become a nuclear power, critics say. Had Mr. Bush instead stuck with a diplomatic course, the critics say, North Korea might not have acquired enough plutonium to make a nuclear weapon. “What is absolutely clear is the decision they took in 2002 to terminate the Agreed Framework gave North Korea the opening” to kick international inspectors out of its Yongbyon nuclear plant and press ahead with its work on the bomb, said Carlos Pascual, director of foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. “That was the tragedy of the Bush administration’s policy,” Mr. Pascual said. “That by opting for terminating our engagement, we opened the door to North Korea’s becoming a nuclear power.” The decision to re-engage with North Korea continues to divide the administration, with officials in Mr. Cheney’s office remaining skeptical of the deal. Right until the end of furious behind-the-scenes talks between State Department officials and their North Korean counterparts over the details of the declaration this week, American negotiators found themselves buffeted by North Korea on one side and conservatives at home on the other. One of the last details to be settled was how much the United States would pay North Korea to blow up the cooling tower at Yongbyon. North Korean officials said the demolition would cost $5 million, and the United States offered $2.5 million — an amount that conservative hard-liners in Washington said was too much, according to several administration officials involved in the talks. “The forthcoming demolition of a nuclear cooling tower this weekend is little more than the destruction of an empty shell,” Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican of Florida, complained in a statement. “This is a sad, sad day,” said John R. Bolton, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations and a leading critic of the new American negotiating stance. “I think Bush believes what Condi is telling him, that they’re going to persuade the North to give up nuclear weapons, and I don’t think that’s going to happen. I think we’ve been taken to the cleaners.” The 60-page declaration from North Korea, one of the world’s most isolated and impoverished nations, described in previously undisclosed detail its abilities in nuclear power and nuclear weapons, meeting a major demand of the United States and other countries that consider the North a dangerous source of instability. “This can be a moment of opportunity for North Korea,” Mr. Bush said, announcing the declaration at the White House early on Thursday morning. “If it continues to make the right choices it can repair its relationship with the international community.” Removing North Korea from the sanctions of the Trading With the Enemy Act, which dates to World War I, would leave only Cuba subject to it. North Korea will become eligible for some additional types of American aid and for loans from international institutions like the World Bank. The accord clears the way for more international shipments of food and fuel to North Korea, which has severe shortages of both commodities. But other sanctions on North Korea will remain, at least for now, prohibiting or restricting American companies from doing business there. North Korean assets in the United States that have been frozen under previous orders are not expected to be released immediately. The North, for its part, declared that it possessed around  80 pounds of plutonium, a crucial part of its nuclear weapons program, and an amount at the low end of the  65-to-110 pound range estimated by American intelligence analysts, according to American and Asian diplomats familiar with the declaration. The total is more than the  65 pounds that North Korea had acknowledged previously. Estimates on how many nuclear bombs North Korea could wring from its plutonium program have ranged from 6 to 10. The administration is hoping to make up for the declaration’s shortfalls through a strong verification program. Administration officials said that North Korea had agreed to allow American inspectors to collect independent samples of nuclear waste at Yongbyon, as well as samples of the reactor core, which, along with the 18,000 pages of operation records provided by North Korea, could go a long way toward helping determine the scale of North Korea’s nuclear program. Part of the delay in reaching the agreement with North Korea was over the issue of verification, administration officials said, including negotiating with the North the precise steps that the United States and international inspectors could take on sampling at Yongbyon. “It sounds to me like the administration has gotten the North Koreans to agree to some intrusive and significant verification steps,” said Gary Samore, a vice president at the Council on Foreign Relations who helped negotiate the Clinton administration’s 1994 agreement with North Korea. Mr. Samore described the promised destruction of the cooling tower at Yongbyon as a photo stunt that is easily reversible, but said that the other steps that North Korea had taken, including rendering the fuel at Yongbyon unusable, were significant.

North Korea has turned over 18,000 pages of documents related to its plutonium program, ahead of an agreement meant to begin the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

WASHINGTON —North Koreahas turned over to the United States 18,000 pages of documents related to its plutonium program dating from 1990, in an effort to resolve remaining differences in a pending agreement meant to begin the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, Bush administration officials said Thursday. The documents contain information about North Korea’s three major campaigns to reprocess plutonium for nuclear weapons, in 1990, 2003 and 2005, a senior official said. The official, like some others who agreed to discuss the documents, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of diplomatic considerations. But the documents do not include information on two other areas about which North Korea has promised to be forthcoming — a uranium program that some officials in the Bush administration regard as another track toward weapons development, and North Korea’s involvement in the proliferation of nuclear material. State Department officials have nevertheless described the move on Thursday as an important step, saying they hope it will help to resolve a dispute over how much plutonium North Korea holds. Administration officials have not said how much plutonium North Korea has admitted to possessing, but they have criticized as incomplete a preliminary declaration it made last December. The documents, which fill seven boxes, “will help shed light on why they have a lower figure,” said an administration official who insisted on anonymity. He said one reason could be that North Korea has more nuclear waste than expected, which could have led to lower plutonium production than the United States had estimated. Officials in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, gave the documents to Sung Kim, the director of the State Department’s Korea office, on Thursday, and he was poring over them in his hotel before bringing them back to the United States this weekend, State Department officials said. They said that several other American diplomats would accompany Mr. Kim and the documents on a commercial flight back to Washington so they could transport the boxes as carry-on luggage. Transporting them as checked baggage would be too risky, the officials said. The acquisition of the documents is the latest step in the Bush administration’s effort to complete a nuclear pact with North Korea before it leaves office in January. The nuclear deal has come under fire from some conservatives, in and out of the administration, who contend that North Korea cannot be trusted to end its nuclear program. On Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal’s editorial page, which has opposed the pact, said Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific affairs, had “made a mockery of the interagency process.” It said he had been bypassing other Bush officials and, instead, “handpicking experts to work at Yongbyon,” where North Korea is dismantling its nuclear reactor. Mr. Hill has the backing of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and they have kept President Bush’s support for a pact that many foreign policy experts say is the administration’s best chance at a tangible foreign policy accomplishment — beginning the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula — in its remaining months. The administration has focused its efforts on getting North Korea to disclose fully information about its plutonium cache, which represents what most experts say is the bulk of its nuclear program. In return for the information it seeks on plutonium, the administration has relaxed a demand for North Korea to admit that it supplied Syria with nuclear technology. The United States has also indicated that it will postpone a demand that North Korea provide an immediate and full accounting of its fledgling uranium program. North Korea’s plutonium program was the source of raw material for the device it tested in October 2006. Sean I.  McCormack, the State Department spokesman, said that officials would take time to review the documents to determine whether North Korea’s declaration about its plutonium program is satisfactory. He said that any final agreement would include a strict verification process for all North Korean nuclear activities. “Our top three priorities are going to be verification, verification, verification,” Mr. McCormack said.

North Korea has postponed the first inter-Korean dialogue of this year, citing time constraints, the Unification Ministry in South Korea said. The countries were to hold talks Tuesday and Wednesday on repairing a cross-border railway and transporting a joint cheering squad to the Beijing Olympics this year by train. No new date was set. “We don’t know exactly why North Korea decided to suspend this week’s inter-Korean meeting,” a ministry spokesman said. He refused to confirm a report by the Yonhap news agency that the suspension was a sign of uneasiness over the South’s new hawkish president, Lee Myung-bak, who takes office Feb. 25 and intends to make aid packages conditional on nuclear compliance under the six-nation talks. Last week, Mr. Lee unveiled plans to abolish the Unification Ministry, which he has accused of being too soft on the North.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said North Korea was cooperating with experts overseeing the mothballing of important nuclear installations.

VIENNA, Aug. 17 (AP) — The United Nations atomic monitoring agency and the United States reported progress  Friday in the international effort to eliminateNorth Korea’s nuclear program. TheInternational Atomic Energy Agencysaid North Korea was cooperating with United Nations experts overseeing the mothballing of important nuclear installations, and a senior American diplomat said talks with North Korea had produced a  “consensus on the way forward.” The two assessments suggest that efforts to do away with North Korea’s nuclear weapons have remained on track since the process resumed in July. A confidential report prepared for next month’s meeting of the agency’s 35-nation board said United Nations experts had been able to monitor and verify the nuclear program’s status with the cooperation of North Korea. The paper, obtained by The Associated Press, was the first since 2003 to confirm the status of North Korea’s known nuclear activities. That year, North Korea expelled United Nations inspectors and quit the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The report said  agency experts had confirmed the shutdown of four nuclear facilities at Yongbyon: a nuclear fuel fabrication plant, a reprocessing plant and two nuclear power plants, one still under construction. Separate word of progress came from Assistant Secretary of State Christopher R. Hill at the end of two days of technical talks on North Korea’s nuclear program in the northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang. Disputes continue about whether the North has another, undeclared nuclear weapons program based on enriched uranium. North Korea said for the first time this week that it was willing to resolve the issue, although it did not acknowledge having a uranium enrichment program, envoys said.

The Bush administration dispatched its top negotiator for one-on-one talks about the North’s nuclear arsenal.
==::==
2007-06-21T00:00:00Z
==::==
WASHINGTON, June 20 — In a sharp reversal of strategy, the Bush administration on Wednesday secretly dispatched its topNorth Koreanegotiator to the country’s capital, Pyongyang, for one-on-one talks about the North Koreans giving up their nuclear arsenal. The visit is the first in five years by a senior American official. The State Department confirmed Wednesday night that the negotiator, Christopher R. Hill, was en route to Pyongyang from Tokyo. [Mr. Hill arrived in Pyongyang on Thursday, The Associated Press reported.] Mr. Hill’s trip came just hours after the United States found a way to return to the North roughly $25 million in funds that were frozen for several years. The United States had frozen the money, saying it came from counterfeiting and trade in missiles and nuclear equipment. It took months for Washington to clear obstacles preventing the money’s return, a move that hawks in the administration had argued was deeply mistaken. Now Mr. Hill can pursue the next items on his agenda: Persuading North Korea to fulfill a commitment it made in February to slow down its main nuclear reactor, whose spent fuel has enabled the country to manufacture plutonium and gain the fuel for eight or more nuclear weapons, according to public American intelligence estimates. In the next step, the North is supposed to provide the United States and the other participants in the six-party negotiations on the issue — Japan, South Korea, Russia and China — with a detailed list of all of its nuclear programs and facilities. The Bush administration is also considering authorizing Mr. Hill to offer to buy from the North Koreans nuclear equipment that they are believed to have purchased several years ago from Abdul Qadeer Khan, the Pakistani nuclear engineer. That equipment could conceivably give the North a second path to building a bomb, by enriching uranium. But American officials do not know whether the North ever  learned the secrets of enrichment, or where enrichment facilities might be. So far, the North has denied that it possesses the equipment. “This is critical to the administration’s plan,” one senior official involved in the North Korea strategy said, “because unless they get their hands on this stuff, there is no way we can argue that we’ve stopped the North from making more nukes.” But it was unclear whether Mr. Hill was prepared to make the offer to the North now, or what form it would take. While Washington or its allies could offer cash for the equipment, they might also promise future deliveries of nuclear fuel to power the civilian nuclear reactors the North insists it needs. Mr. Hill’s trip was organized in such secrecy that he apparently did not convey his plans to top Japanese officials, whom he visited Wednesday in Tokyo. Japan has refused to join the disarmament deal that North Korea signed in February. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said Japan will only consider joining the deal after resolution of the cases of about a dozen Japanese said to have been abducted by North Korea. In confirming reports of Mr. Hill’s trip on Wednesday night — after sidestepping questions during the day to give Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice time to alert the Japanese and other American allies — the State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, cast the trip as “part of the consultations” with all of the countries in the North Korea talks, trying to make it sound routine. But for years the administration has refused to engage one on one with the North Koreans. Ms. Rice had to maneuver around Vice President Dick Cheney, officials said in February, to reach the deal that gives the North hundreds of thousands of tons of fuel oil in return for step-by-step disablement of its facilities. It was exactly the kind of grand bargain the administration had avoided for years, as Mr. Cheney and others argued that the United States should not prolong the life of the North Korean government of Kim Jong-il, but rather seek ways to speed its demise. “Condi knows she needs a big win here,” said a senior administration official who has dealt with her often on North Korea. “They know they are getting nowhere on Iraq, and they probably won’t get far on Iran. She needs to show that she can reduce at least one big threat.” Late last week North Korea invited the return of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, presumably to witness the shutdown of its main nuclear reactor at Yongbyon. Those inspectors were thrown out of the country in late 2002, after American officials confronted the North with evidence that it had sought to cheat on a previous nuclear accord by purchasing from Dr. Khan the centrifuges to enrich uranium. Under the first phase of the accord  reached in February, North Korea agreed to shut down the reactor after its frozen funds were returned. In addition, South Korea will deliver 50,000 tons of fuel oil to the energy-starved North after the shutdown is confirmed. Mr. Hill said in Tokyo that the next round of talks should focus on how to carry out the February agreement’s second phase: declaring where the North has hidden decades of secret work, on the way to dismantling it. That is expected to prove even more difficult; several American officials say they did not believe the North would ever give up all of its nuclear program. The last time an American delegation traveled to Pyongyang to negotiate, it ended badly. Mr. Hill’s predecessor, James Kelly, went to Pyongyang in 2002 and opened the talks by telling the North Koreans that the Untied States had evidence they had purchased centrifuges and other equipment, and were breaking a 1994 accord. The Americans said the North first confirmed it had obtained the equipment, then later denied it. That started a confrontation that resulted in a cutoff of American fuel oil supplies to the North. In retaliation, the North ejected the international inspectors and moved its nuclear fuel for what it said was conversion into plutonium. That began a downward spiral of events, culminating in North Korea’s test of a nuclear device last October. Now, some Korea experts say the confrontation was avoidable. But President Bush was focused on Iraq, and his former aides say he was convinced that once Saddam Hussein fell, the North  would be intimidated into giving up its  weapons.

President Lee Myung-bak announced changes as he accepted his defense minister’s resignation, but he has little maneuvering room in responding to North Korea.
==::==
2010-11-26T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — Responding to growing public criticism after a deadly North Korean attack, PresidentLee Myung-bakaccepted the resignation of his defense minister on Thursday and announced changes in the military’s rules of engagement to make it easier forSouth Koreato strike back with greater force, especially if civilians are threatened. The government also announced plans to increase the number of troops and heavy weapons on Yeonpyeong Island, where two marines and two civilians died Tuesday in an artillery fusillade from the North. On Friday, President Lee initially put forward a security adviser, Lee Hee-won, as the new defense minister. But the government later pulled back on that announcement. But Mr. Lee, who came to office two years ago vowing to get tough with the North, has little maneuvering room in formulating a response. While the attack appears to have pushed anti-North Korean sentiment here to its highest level in years, there is little public support for taking military action against the North that might lead to an escalation of hostilities. “North Koreahas nothing to lose, while we have everything to lose,” said Kang Won-taek, a professor of politics at Seoul National University. “Lee Myung-bak has no choice but to soften his tone to keep this country peaceful. It is not an appealing choice, but it is the only realistic choice.” The South’s powerful neighbor is also counseling restraint. The Chinese prime minister, Wen Jiabao, said Thursday that Beijing opposed any provocative military behavior by either side on the Korean Peninsula, Xinhua, the state news agency, reported. On Thursday, while North Korea warned through its official news agency of further military retaliation if provoked by South Korea, Mr. Lee said only, “We should not drop our guard in preparation for the possibility of another provocation by North Korea,” according to his chief spokesman, Hong Sang-pyo. “A provocation like this can recur any time.” The changes in the rules of engagement were similarly restrained. South Korean defenses on five coastal islands in the Yellow Sea had been set up primarily to guard against possible amphibious landings by North Korean troops. Critics said Thursday that the military had not anticipated the possibility of an attack by North Korean artillery batteries, which are reportedly in caves along the North’s coastline. “Now, an artillery battle has become the new threat, so we’re reassessing the need to strengthen defenses,” Mr. Lee told lawmakers. The new measures he outlined included doubling the number of howitzers and upgrading other weaponry. The new rules of engagement will be based on whether military or civilian sites are the targets, said Mr. Hong, the presidential spokesman, adding that the move was made to “change the paradigm of responding to North Korea’s provocations.” Previously, South Korean forces were allowed to respond only in kind — if the North fired artillery, the South could answer only with artillery — to contain any dispute. Now, officials said, the military would be allowed to use greater force. Mr. Lee’s response to this week’s artillery attack is not the first time he has been criticized for sitting on his hands in the face of a deadly provocation by the North. Two years ago, when a South Korean tourist was shot by a sentry at a North Korean mountain resort, his government’s response amounted to a slap on the wrist: suspending tours to the resort and banning South Korean civic groups from visiting the North. But the clearest case was Mr. Lee’s response in March to the sinking of a South Korean warship, theCheonan. Mr. Lee at first seemed to stall by waiting for the results of an international investigation, which took two months to conclude that the ship had been sunk by a North Korean torpedo. When he responded, it was with relatively mild measures like reducing the South’s already minuscule trade with the North, resuming the South’s cold-war-era propaganda speakers along the demilitarized zone and demanding an apology. But the speakers have yet to be turned on after North Korea threatened to shoot at them, and Mr. Lee dropped the apology demand as a condition for talks. Mr. Lee was widely blamed in South Korea for having provoked the Cheonan episode by ending unconditional aid to the North at the start of his presidency. “Before, the public saw him as too hard, and now they see him as too soft,” said Yoo Ho-yeol, a professor of North Korean studies at Korea University in Seoul. Despite public pressure to do more, Mr. Lee does not have many options for less lethal forms of pressure on the North,  diplomatic or economic. North Korea has weathered years of economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation. In fact, the tough economic conditions appear only to give the North  motivation to continue its  brinkmanship, to extract aid as it faces a winter of food and fuel shortages. Some analysts say the North is also using the provocations to burnish the military credentials of Kim Jong-un, the youngest son of the North’s leader, Kim Jong-il, and his heir apparent. Analysts say making sanctions effective would require greater support from China, North Korea’s traditional protector, which has so far been reluctant to tighten the screws on the North. In recent days, Mr. Lee and President Obama have agreed to make new appeals to Chinese leaders to put more pressure on the North, but analysts say they are not optimistic that the Chinese will comply. Still, South Korean officials said they would urge China to act more responsibly by pressing the North to refrain from further attacks. They also said they would ask Beijing to more closely monitor trade with North Korea by Chinese merchants, which they said has been a way for the North to bypass international economic sanctions. Mr. Lee and his advisers appear to have concluded that a less confrontational stance is the only way to persuade North Korea to end its provocations. A few analysts speculated that Mr. Lee might eventually end up not far from his liberal predecessors like former President Roh Moo-hyun, who used economic aid to appease the North and reduce tensions on the peninsula. “Anyone would conclude that the peaceful approach is best to reverse the situation,” said Moon Jung-in, a  former adviser in the Roh administration. “A hard-line approach is not a real option.”

By firing artillery shells, North Korea escalated already high tensions following the sinking of a South Korean warship.
==::==
2010-08-10T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreafired 110 artillery rounds at waters near a disputed western sea border with the South on Monday, escalating tensions already raised to a high pitch byaggressive South Korean naval exercisesand the North’s seizure of a squidding boat. About 10 shells landed near the South Korean border island of Byeongryeong, followed by an additional 100 rounds falling near another border island, Yeonpyeong, said a spokesman of the Office of Joint Chiefs of Staff in Seoul, who insisted on anonymity until there was a formal government announcement. Between 5:52 p.m. and 6:14 p.m., personnel on navy ships and South Korean marines based on the islands saw columns of sea water spouting up after the shells struck, he said. There were differing reports on whether the shells crossed the  Northern Limit Line, the western sea border between the Koreas drawn by American-led United Nations forces at the end of the Korean War.South Koreaand the United States  recognize and patrol the line, but   North Korea has never accepted it and claims waters many miles to its south. The South Korean spokesman said all the shells fell to the north of the line, while the South Korean national news agency Yonhap and SBS, a domestic television network, citing unidentified military sources, reported that some of the rounds crossed the line. The two South Korean islands, heavily populated by South Korean marines and fishermen, lie within the 17-mile range of North Korea’s coastline artillery. South Korea  recently said that any North Korean shells falling south of that line would be considered an attack and  responded to in kind. “The shells came from North Korea’s shore guns,” the South Korean spokesman said. “Our navy boosted its surveillance and combat readiness. We also broadcast a warning to the North Koreans.” He would not give more details. The waters around the two islands were the site of three recent naval skirmishes between the Koreas — in1999, 2002andlast November. In March,an explosionstruck theCheonan, a 1,200-ton South Korean Navy corvette,  in those waters, and the ship went down, killing 46 sailors.  Strains in the North-South relationship deepened wheninternational investigators fixed blame on the North. North Korea has denied responsibility for the Cheonan sinking and called the accusation a justification for warmongering by South Korea and the United States. A recent series of naval exercises, some conducted with the United States, elicited a North Korean threat of “strong physical retaliation” against any vessels that strayed into its territorial waters. On Sunday, theNorth impounded the squidding boat. North Korea regularly threatens a major military clash in the disputed waters. In December, it threatened to fire shells into the waters as a way to enforce its claims. Later, both militaries fired shells, but they did not attack each other, nor did their shells cross the Northern Limit Line.

A poster recently smuggled out of the country depicts a red fist smashing an enemy warship.

SEOUL, South Korea — A propaganda poster recently smuggled out ofNorth Koreadepicts the North Korean military smashing an enemy warship in half, a scene evocative of the sinking of a South Korean warship earlier this year. Although the poster did not identify the ship in the poster as theCheonan, the South Korean corvettesunk in March, it raised suspicions that North Korea might have begun bragging about the sinking for domestic propaganda purposes, said Radio Free Asia, which released a photograph of the poster this week. With a caption that says “If they attack, we will smash them in a single blow,” the poster shows the red fist of a North Korean sailor splitting an enemy ship. The Cheonan was split in two and sunk in waters near the disputed western sea border between the two Koreas. Forty-six sailors were killed. A South Korean-led team of international investigatorsconcluded in Maythat the ship was destroyed by a North Korean torpedo attack, though North Korea has vehemently denied involvement. But North Korea secretly awarded medals to the crew of a North Korean submarine and boasted of its victory during propaganda lectures for its military and party elites, according to recent reports by South Korean Web sites that collect news from sources inside the North. The South Korean government  could not confirm those reports, and the North’s official news media have repeatedly accused the South and the United States of fabricating the Cheonan sinking to raise tensions. Radio Free Asia, which is supported by the United States, said it obtained the photograph of the poster from a Chinese businessman who recently returned from North Korea. It remained unclear whether the poster was made before or after the Cheonan sinking, or whether it depicted an earlier North-South naval clash and was distributed now to put up a fierce face amid rising tensions with the West. Posters and public slogans are a major tool of propaganda in the North. A common poster showsNorth Korean missiles raining down on what looks like the United States Capitol. Its caption says: “If they start a war of aggression, we will first destroy the Americans.”

Intelligence agencies believe Kim Jong-il ordered the sinking of a South Korean warship to help secure the succession of his youngest son. 
==::==
2010-05-23T00:00:00Z
==::==
WASHINGTON — A new American intelligence analysis of a deadly torpedo attack on a South Korean warship concludes thatKim Jong-il, the ailing leader ofNorth Korea, must have authorized the torpedo assault, according to senior American officials who cautioned that the assessment was based on their sense of the political dynamics there rather than hard evidence. The officials said they were increasingly convinced that Mr. Kim ordered the sinking of the ship, theCheonan, to help secure the succession of his youngest son. “We can’t say it is established fact,” said one senior American official who was involved in the highly classified assessment, based on information collected by many of the country’s 16 intelligence agencies. “But there is very little doubt, based on what we know about the current state of the North Korean leadership and the military.” Nonetheless, both the conclusion and the timing of the assessment could be useful to the United States as it seeks to rally support against North Korea. On Monday,South Korea’s president, Lee Myung-bak, who has moved cautiously since the assault, is expected to call for the United Nations Security Council to condemn the attack and is likely to terminate the few remaining trade ties between North and South that provide the North with hard currency. But those steps have little chance of proving meaningful unless China, which hosted Mr. Kim two weeks ago, agrees to join the condemnation and refuses to make up whatever revenue North Korea loses from any trade embargoes. China, North Korea’s last true ally, has traditionally been reluctant to pressure the North too much, even when the North Koreans  conducted nuclear tests, for fear of toppling the government and sending a flood of refugees across its border. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton will be in Beijing when the South Korean action is announced, leading a delegation of 200 American officials, including roughly half of the Obama administration’s cabinet, in an annual “strategic dialogue” with Chinese leaders on a variety of economic and political issues. So far, at least in public, both American and South Korean leaders have been careful never to link Mr. Kim to the sinking of  the Cheonan in March, which killed 46 sailors. Officials said that was in part because of the absence of hard evidence — difficult to come by in the rigidly controlled North — but also largely because both countries were trying to avoid playing into Mr. Kim’s hands by casting one of the worst attacks since the 1953 armistice as another piece of lore about the Kim family taking on South Korea and the West. The North’s state propaganda surrounding that imagery has been used by the Kim family  to sustain two generations of leaders since the end of World War II. Under the leading  theory of the American intelligence agencies, Mr. Kim ordered the attack to re-establish both his control and his credentials after a debilitating stroke two years ago, and by extension reinforcing his right to name his son Kim Jong-un as his successor. North Korea has denied any involvement in the attack, despite the presentation of forensic evidence on Thursday — including parts of the torpedo found in the wreckage — that experts from three countries said established that the torpedo was launched from a North Korean submarine. Although the American officials who spoke about the intelligence assessment would not reveal much about what led them to conclude that Mr. Kim was directly involved, one factor appeared to be intelligence that he appeared on April 25, the anniversary of the founding  of the Korean People’s Army, with a  military unit that intelligence agencies believe to have been responsible for the attack. Mr. Kim used the event to praise the group, Unit 586, the officials said, and around that time a fourth star appears to have been given to Gen. Kim Myong-guk, who officials believe may have played a crucial role in executing the attack. General Kim is believed to have been demoted to a three-star general last year, perhaps in response to the humiliation that took place after a North Korean ship ventured into South Korean waters. The North Korean ship was all but destroyed, and some analysts believe the attack on the Cheonan, which was in South Korean waters, was planned as retribution. “Nobody is going to take overt credit for the sinking,” said Jonathan Pollack, a professor at the Naval War College and an expert on North Korea’s military. “But Kim’s visit to this unit has all the hallmarks of congratulating them for a job well done.” The senior American officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the intelligence assessment is classified,  said they ruled out the idea that General Kim or another military officer decided on his own to  attack, but they did not explain how they reached that conclusion. Victor Cha, a North Korea expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington and a former official in the National Security Council during President George W. Bush’s second term in office, noted that when Mr. Kim was on the rise three decades ago, “there were similar incidents designed to build his credibility” as a leader. The Cheonan episode has posed some difficult choices for the Obama administration  at a time when  its national security team is preoccupied with Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran. In an intense series of back-channel discussions with Mr. Lee, senior administration officials, including President Obama, have praised South Korea for its calm response. Like the South Koreans, American officials fear that any military retaliation against the North could quickly escalate, leading to rocket attacks on Seoul, major casualties and a panic among investors in South Korea. At the same time, they worry that if North Korea gets through the episode without paying a price — one that American officials decline to define — it could embolden the North Korean military. The North Korean defense commission, which rarely issues public statements, turned out a fiery-sounding warning last week, saying it would respond to any military retaliation with “all-out war.”

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreaaccused the United States andSouth Koreaon Monday of creating provocations by allowing tourists and journalists into the heavily armed buffer zone that has divided the Korean Peninsula since the armistice signed more than a half century ago. In a statement reported by news agencies, the North demanded an end to the tours in the so-called demilitarized zone, calling them part of a pattern of “psychological warfare” and warning of “unpredictable incidents including the loss of human lives in this area for which the U.S. side will be wholly to blame.” While North Korean statements of belligerence are routine, the warning came as tensions in the Korean Peninsula were already high over the mysterious sinking of a South Korean naval patrol ship near the disputed border with the North on Friday. Hopes were dimming for 46 missing sailors of the 1,200-ton vessel, the Cheonan. The North Korean warning said nothing of theship’s sinking. South Korea has not ruled out North Korean sabotage of the vessel, and President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea has ordered an investigation. No new survivors, nor any bodies, have been found since 58 of the ship’s 104 sailors were plucked from the water alive on Friday evening. Relatives of the missing sailed overnight aboard a military ship, arriving at the scene of the sinking on Sunday. “I heard a terrible explosion and the ship keeled suddenly to the right. We lost power and telecommunications,” Choi Won-il, captain of the Cheonan, told the relatives. “I was trapped in the cabin for five minutes before my colleagues broke the window in and let me out. When I got out, the stern had already broken away and disappeared underwater.” Most of those missing were believed to have been trapped inside their rapidly sinking ship as waters gushed into their dark underdeck, officials said. “Many sailors were hanging onto the bow of the sinking ship,” Kim Jin-ho, a crewman on a civilian ferry to Baengnyeong, a South Korean border island, told YTN television, describing the rescue scene on Friday night. “They were shouting for help. They were falling into water.” Regardless whether North Korea was involved, the vessel’s sinking reawakened South Koreans’ worst fears about the North Korean military. Ubiquitous propaganda billboards in North Korea’s cities and towns exhort its soldiers to turn themselves into kamikaze-like “human bombs” when war breaks out. Some family members of the ship’s crew theorized that the Cheonan was rundown and in need of repair, an assertion that the military publicly denied. Relatives were seen yelling “Liars!” and kicking the car carrying Captain Choi after his briefing. The ship was on a routine patrol mission in the Yellow Sea when it sank near Baengnyeong, eight miles from the North Korean coast and 120 miles from the South Korean mainland. The sinking is one of South Korea’s worst peacetime naval disasters. In 1974, a navy landing ship capsized off the south coast in stormy weather, killing 159 sailors and coast guard personnel. In 1967, 39 sailors were killed when North Korean shore guns pounded a South Korean Navy ship off the east coast. Military accidents get special scrutiny here, since North and South Korea are still in an official state of war. All eligible South Korean men serve in the military. The waters in the disputed western sea near the Koreas make up the most volatile section of the border. North Korea rejects a maritime demarcation line drawn by the United Nations at the end of the war. The two sides engaged in naval clashes in 1999 and 2002. In November, naval patrol boats from the North and South exchanged fire after a North Korean boat crossed the disputed sea border.

An American scholar said North Korean officials told him they had “weaponized” enough for several nuclear bombs.

SEOUL,South Korea— The North Korean military declared an “all-out confrontational posture” against South Korea on Saturday as an American scholar said North Korean officials told him they had “weaponized” enough plutonium for roughly four or five nuclear bombs. American intelligence officials have previously estimated that the North had harvested enough fuel for six or more bombs, although it has never been clear whether the North constructed the weapons. The scholar, Selig S. Harrison, said the officials had not defined what “weaponized” meant, but the implication was that they had built nuclear arms. The North conducted a test of a nuclear device in 2006, but it appeared to result in a fizzle and experts concluded the explosion was relatively small. While the country has often claimed to possess a “deterrent,” this appears to be the first time it has quantified how much plutonium it says it has turned into weapons. After the threats on Saturday, South Korea ordered its military to heighten vigilance along the heavily fortified border withNorth Korea, according to a spokesman for the South Korean military joint chiefs of staff. North Korea’s saber-rattling toward the South has increased in intensity since President Lee Myung-bak took office in Seoul a year ago with a vow to take a tougher stance on North Korea, reversing 10 years of his liberal predecessors’ efforts to engage the North with economic aid. But what made the threat on Saturday unusual, and more worrisome to some South Korean analysts, was the way it was delivered: in a statement read on North Korean television by a uniformed spokesman for the North’s joint chiefs of staff. “Strong military measures will follow from our revolutionary armed force,” the spokesman, a colonel, said, according to Yonhap, South Korea’s national news agency, which monitors North Korean broadcasts. Usually the North Korean government issues written statements that are delivered by the state-controlled media; sometimes the statements are read by press officers, not by a uniformed member of the military. The spokesman warned of a clash along a disputed western sea border between the Koreas. Their navies fought skirmishes there in 1999 and 2002. It is always difficult to decipher the messages that North Korea’s government is trying to send with its often bombastic statements. In times of crucial bargaining, North Korea often tries to drive a wedge between Washington and South Korea and raises the stakes by increasing demands and issuing threats. With President-elect Barack Obama about to take office and negotiations over the North’s nuclear program expected to resume, it is possible that the North is merely setting up its negotiating position. But analysts said the North’s remarks could also be an indication that it was intending to hold onto its arms despite an agreement it signed with five countries including the United States in 2005, in which it committed to eventually giving up any nuclear weapons. The exact conditions under which it would do so were left vague. Questions over the health of the country’s leader, Kim Jong-il, also complicate any attempts to understand North Korea’s aims. In August, there were reports that Mr. Kim suffered a stroke, and since then rumors have swirled about whether he is still making important decisions. Mr. Harrison, the scholar, presented North Korea’s claims of weaponization on Saturday in Beijing after returning from North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang. Mr. Harrison, a former journalist who is the director of the Asia program at the Center for International Policy, has traveled several times to North Korea to meet with senior officials there. “They’ve raised the bar and said, ‘We are a nuclear weapons state, and deal with us on that basis,’ ” Mr. Harrison said at a news conference in the St. Regis Hotel. Mr. Harrison acknowledged that North Korea could be bluffing to use the claim of having nuclear weapons as a negotiating tactic. North Korea had declared to the United States last year that it possessed 37 kilograms of plutonium; officials told Mr. Harrison on his trip that they had weaponized almost 31 kilograms. Despite that news, he said all the officials he met with seemed eager to open discussions with the incoming Obama administration. “All the statements about Obama were very helpful, very respectful,” he said. Mr. Harrison said the North Korean officials had several proposals for Mr. Obama, including allowing North Korea to have access to long-term, low-interest credit to buy food. South Korea had no immediate reaction to Mr. Harrison’s report. Earlier Saturday, North Korea had appeared to toughen its stance toward Washington, saying that reopening diplomatic ties would not be enough to persuade it to give up its nuclear weapons. It said it would maintain its “status as a nuclear weapons state” as long as there was a nuclear threat from the United States. “We can live without normalizing ties with the United States, but we cannot live without a nuclear deterrent,” a spokesman for North Korea’s Foreign Ministry told its official news agency, KCNA. In the past, the North had said it would not dismantle any weapons until the United States changed what it termed its “hostile attitude.” In the spokesman’s comments, and his similar statement last Tuesday, North Korea laid out its demands as it prepared for a new series of negotiations with  Mr. Obama, who will be inaugurated on Tuesday. In its Tuesday statement, North Korea indicated that the removal of an American nuclear threat meant the removal of South Korea from the American nuclear umbrella, the introduction of a verification mechanism to ensure that no American atomic weapons are deployed in or pass through South Korea, and even simultaneous nuclear disarmament talks among “all nuclear states,” including itself. Six-nation talks on ending North Korea’s nuclear programs, which include the United States, stalled in the last months of the Bush administration as the United States and North Korea bickered over how much nuclear inspection the North should accept.

Kim Jong-il was able to walk and talk, South Korean lawmakers said after a briefing by the South’s spy agency.

SEOUL,South Korea— American and South Korean intelligence reports that the North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, suffered a stroke raise questions that the North’s neighbors have long feared asking. If Mr. Kim dies or is incapacitated, who is going to take over the world’s most isolated and unpredictable regime, now armed with nuclear weapons? And what will happen to a nation-church that has worshiped  its “Dear Leader” as a god-like figure? Mr. Kim suffered a stroke in mid-August but has recovered enough to talk and walk, South Korean lawmakers told reporters after receiving a briefing by the National Intelligence Service. But Kim Sung-ho, the South Korean spy chief, told the National Assembly’s Intelligence Committee that this was not the first time Mr. Kim had had an operation for a circulatory problem, though nothing else was known about past medical operations, the lawmakers said. There was no sign of unrest in the North, they were told. “We have intelligence reports that after intensive treatments, his condition has considerably improved,” a spokeswoman of the spy agency said, without confirming the lawmakers’ comments. There was “no problem” with Mr. Kim, Japan’s Kyodo news agency quotedNorth Korea’s No. 2 leader, Kim Yong-nam, as saying in Pyongyang, the North’s capital. “We see such reports as not only worthless, but rather as a conspiracy plot,” another senior North Korean official, Song Il-ho, told Kyodo. Mr. Kim, 66, long suspected of suffering chronic illnesses, was conspicuously absent from a parade on Tuesday to mark North Korea’s 60th anniversary. Following his absence, American officials said Tuesday that Mr. Kim was seriously ill and was likely to have suffered a stroke weeks ago. Although both American and South Korean officials said it did not appear that Mr. Kim’s death was imminent, the episode prompted analysts to contemplate the prospects of a chaotic power struggle in case Mr. Kim does not recover enough to resume his tight grip on power. Mr. Kim took over after his father, Kim Il-sung, the founder of North Korea, died of heart failure in 1994. Long before that, he had been groomed as a successor and was running important state affairs. In contrast, none of his three known sons or his daughter have emerged as an obvious candidate to take the dynasty into a third generation. If Mr. Kim had intended to pick one but now finds his time running out, analysts both in and outside the Korean Peninsula said on Wednesday, the most likely situation would be the stakeholders in Pyongyang forming a collective leadership. “The majority view now is that it will be a collective leadership with some member of the Kim family as a figurehead,” said Andrei Lankov, a North Korea expert at Kookmin University in Seoul. “But situations can easily go in an unpredictable direction. Many top generals and some civilian leaders will probably be overcome by their own power lust, so some serious infighting with unpredictable results is likely, too.” Peter Hayes, director at the Nautilus Institute, a research institution based in San Francisco, guessed that “a leader from the current political elite with strong ties to the military” would take over. Such a leader would stress continuity while trying to put a slow modernizing process in place. Mr. Hayes and other analysts believe there would be no change in North Korea’s nuclear strategy. Any leader or leaders would continue to cultivate the powerful national myths that permeate North Korean life and propaganda, based on xenophobic nationalism and the personality cult built around Mr. Kim’s father, the national founder revered among North Koreans, Mr. Hayes said. A potential power vacuum would set off intense diplomatic maneuvering. Washington, whose priority is to denuclearize the North, would  do what it  could  to block the rise of a hard-line military leader, analysts said. China wants  North Korea to continue as a buffer against American and Japanese influence, but it has also played a crucial role as a mediator between North Korea and the West. Chinese leaders were angry that North Korea, which relies on financial help from China, pushed ahead with provocative actions like a nuclear test in October 2006. South Korea abhors the prospects of a sudden collapse of North Korea. It also fears that unrest might invite the Chinese military into the North. On Wednesday, President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea called a hurried meeting with senior aides to discuss the latest events in the North. The inner workings of Mr. Kim’s regime are shrouded in mystery. Even experts who have spent a lifetime watching North Korea from the outside find it hard to predict its workings. They pore over the images of rare public events, like Tuesday’s parade, for clues to who is up and who is down in the power order. They said that even  when Mr. Kim dies, it could take days for the news to trickle out. Despite endless rumors about challenges to his leadership Mr. Kim has maintained a ruthless grip on power, his control such that even his closest aides do not know what the others are doing, according to South Korean intelligence officials. If Mr. Kim is incapacitated but alive, the outside world will not see him for a long time, said Leonid A. Petrov, a North Korea expert at Australian National University. Then “the group of generals will come out and tell us that the Dear Leader has authorized us to do this and that, and then they will run the country on his behalf until he is really dead,” Mr. Petrov said. Aging and ailing confidants of Mr. Kim like Kim Yong-nam and Jo Myong-rok may step in. But the casting votes in any power coalition might be held by younger technocrats like Ri Yong-chol and Ri Je-gang, who run military and organizational affairs at the ruling Workers’ Party, analysts said. Chang Song-taek, Mr. Kim’s brother-in-law, is also considered a contender for power. Mr. Kim’s eldest son, Jong-nam, 37, would have been the natural choice in a Confucian society that favors the eldest son as heir. But he has a handicap: his  mother, a divorced actress, never legally married Kim Jong-il. She died in Moscow in 2002. Kim Jong-nam embarrassed his father in 2001 when he was caught trying to enter Japan on a fake Dominican passport.  He has since been sighted a few times by Japanese reporters in Beijing. That has raised speculation that he may be on the run from a half brother, Jong-chol, 27, and, before that, Jong-chol’s mother, Ko Young-hee. Ms. Ko, a Japan-born prima donna of Pyongyang’s premier song-and-dance troupe, gave Kim Jong-il another son, Jong-un, 25. Ms. Ko raised her status, and the fortune of her sons, by accompanying Mr. Kim on his “guidance tours” of the military, the loyal backbone of his rule. But she reportedly  died in 2004, and neither of her two sons is seen in North Korean media. “My guess is like this: they will keep the Kim family as a social and political institution like the emperor system in Japan, offering symbolic and moral power for North Koreans, but are likely to establish a collective leadership system in which the military will play a key role,” said Shin Gi-wook, director of the Walter H. Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center at Stanford. “We may, then, witness some political instability in the North,” Mr. Shin added.

SEOUL, South Korea —  The top American military officer lashed out at China on Wednesday for failing to intervene diplomatically withNorth Korea, as he met with his South Korean counterpart to discuss possible armed responses to future provocations from Pyongyang. Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff, sharply criticized Beijing for not condemning North Korea’s artillery barrage against a South Korean island two weeks ago. Two marines and two civilians were killed in the attack, which has frayed diplomatic nerves in the region and brought both militaries to heightened states of alert. “China has enormous influence over the North, and therefore they have a unique responsibility,” Admiral Mullen said after meeting with Gen. Han Min-koo, chairman of the South Korean Joint Chiefs. “Now is the time for Beijing to step up to that responsibility and guide the North, and indeed the whole region, to a better future.” “Even tacit approval of Pyongyang’s brazenness,” he said, “leaves all the neighbors in the region asking, ‘What’s next?’“ Rather than disavowing the North’s use of military force against civilians, China has instead criticized the response by Washington and Seoul — a large set of military exercises in the Yellow Sea off China and North Korea, drills that were led by the American carrier George Washington and its battle group. General Han called the Nov. 23 attack on Yeonpyeong Island “an intolerable act against humanity,” and said the United States andSouth Koreahad agreed to hold further combined military exercises in the region. A joint statement by the two officers said the drills will be “designed to effectively deter North Korean aggression and strengthen the joint capabilities to respond.” South Korea is holding a nationwide set of artillery drills this week. And the United States and Japan are currently staging their largest-ever war games, including, for the first time, South Korean observers. As part of its response to the Yeonpyeong episode, Beijing called for arestart of the so-called six-party talksaimed at dismantling North Korea’s nuclear programs, which Pyongyang continues to pursue. North Korea recently unveiled a new uranium enrichment facility, which it said was operational, and a new light water reactor that is under construction. Washington, Seoul and Tokyo have rejected new talks. The South Korean and Japanese foreign ministers conferred with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Washington on Monday in what Admiral Mullen called “a truly historic trilateral meeting.” Admiral Mullen, who described North Korea as “a rapidly evolving threat,” also made a point on Wednesday of affirming the military alliance between Seoul and Washington. “We have been at your side for six decades, and President Obama wanted me to assure you that we will be at your side for many more,” he said, adding that the alliance was distinguished by “a shoulder-to-shoulder approach.” But he stopped short of saying there would be a wingtip-to-wingtip approach in the event of any quick South Korean response to a future North Korean provocation. Planning, yes. Bombers in the air, no. South Korea’s newly appointed defense minister, Kim Kwan-jin, said last week that airstrikes against the North are nowone of South Korea’s optionsunder Seoul’s new rules of engagement. The government has been  severely criticized here for what is seen as a slow and even mild response to the North Korean shelling. But Admiral Mullen on Wednesday praised the South Korean response for its “restraint,” and said he has not asked that South Korean military planners “take their air assets off the table.” He also stressed that cooperation with Japanese military forces would be essential to future stability in the region, and he planned to leave for Tokyo on Wednesday night for talks with Japanese defense officials. “We have to get to a place where there’s much more trilateral cooperation that there has been in the past,” Admiral Mullen said. “The Japanese, likewise, have a stake,” he added, “in seeing this threat countered.” Reports of artillery fire in the North briefly spooked Seoul on Wednesday morning but the military quickly announced that the firing was part of regular drills being held in the North. General Han said he could not confirm that the North’s artillery drills were timed to coincide with Admiral Mullen’s visit. Meanwhile, the governor of New Mexico, Bill Richardson, will travel to North Korea next week to meet with government officials, Reuters reported, although a senior American  official characterized the trip as a private visit. Mr. Richardson served as the American ambassador to the United Nations in the Clinton administration.
