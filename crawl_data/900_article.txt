MOSCOW, Sept. 10 -- A North Korean Government delegation arrived in Moscow tonight aboard a special train for conversations with the chiefs of the Soviet Government. According to Premier Kim II Sung, these conversations should assist "the peaceful uniting" of Korea as well as provide a stronger base for relations between the Soviet Union and Korea, both political and economic.

Authorities in South Korean were checking signs that the North Korean leader was visiting China on Thursday.

The South Korean authorities were checking signs that the North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, was visitingChinaby special train on Thursday, an official  in the presidential office ofSouth Koreasaid. South Korean news media, including the national news agency, Yonhap, and the mass-circulation daily, Chosun, reported the information in their Web sites. "We have signs that Kim Jong-il is visiting China," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the matter. "It’s unclear whether he has arrived or still on the move." A government intelligence official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, agreed that there were such signs. He declined to discuss details. If confirmed, this would mark Mr. Kim’s sixth trip to China, his impoverished country’s largest trade and aid provider, and his second in three months.North Koreaand China usually do not confirm a trip by Mr. Kim until after it is over. Reports of Mr. Kim traveling to China came a day after former U.S. President Jimmy Carter flew to Pyongyang on Wednesday to win the release of an American held prisoner in the North. There has been no word on whether Mr. Carter met Mr. Kim. It would be  highly unusual for Mr. Kim to leave his country to visit its old communist ally, China, at this time, as an important guest from the United States was visiting his country. Early next month, North Korea is to convene an important meeting of representatives of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea. Officials said they would monitor the meeting for  clues about Mr. Kim’s plans to hand over power to his third son, Kim Jong-un. Yonhap reported the possibility that the father was taking his son with him on his latest trip, possibly to introduce him to Chinese leaders. North Korea needs Chinese aid urgently as it faces a particularly harsh spring of food shortages. Last week, it reported widespread damages from flooding. South Korea has cut off most trade with the North and the United States is planning to announce additional sanctions following the March sinking of a South Korean warship. Both Washington and Seoul blame the North for the sinking, while the North is denying. The resulting confrontation forced North Korea to move closer to its traditional ally, China, analysts said. Beijing hopes to assert its growing influence in international diplomacy by persuading North Korea to return to six-nation talks that are aimed at endingNorth Korea’s nuclear weaponsprogram but have been stalling for two years.

The political forces that are threatening the Korean peninsula are not those that are shaking confidence in the euro zone.

Investors rarely like wars or rumors of war. But for global markets, the renewed military tension on the Korean peninsula comes at a particularly inopportune time. The threat to this fairly big economy — South Korea’s economy is four times larger than Greece’s — furthers the impression of a world out of control. South Korea’s response to the likelihood that the North torpedoed a South Korean naval vessel in March seems proportionate, merited and economically minor. The severance of relations  will hit an annual trade of only $286 million, about 0.3 percent of South Korea’s gross domestic product. The effect on the already impoverished northerners may even be mitigated by China, Pyongyang’s traditional ally. In more settled economic times, markets could probably absorb this increase in Korean tension without too much difficulty. Everyone knows North Korea is dangerously unpredictable. Investors usually respond to provocative actions with only a brief flurry of worry. They sometimes even interpret aggression as desperation, and dream of potential gains from eventual Korean unification. This time could be different. As of Tuesday, the Kospi index in South Korea had dropped 4.8  percent since the official report on the sinking, and the won had fallen 5.3 percent againstthe dollar. Investors may be thinking South Korean companies will face higher capital costs or that military expense will hold back the country’s growth. Or they may just be blindly shunning geopolitical risk. The fear is likely to be exaggerated. An all-out war can probably be avoided, even if North Korea’s announcement of a freeze in relations leads to direct military confrontations. What’s more, the Korean economy accounts for only 1.5 percent of global G.D.P. The euro zone contributes 22 percent. The political forces that are threatening the Korean peninsula are completely different from those that are shaking confidence inthe eurozone. But there is one unfortunate similarity. Until a few months ago, the governments, which had responded so powerfully to the financial crisis, were a comfort to markets. But weak and wild policies around the globe are undermining that conviction. No Expletives, Please Carol Bartz’s foul language  may play well in the purple bleacher seats atYahoo, the demoralized Internet business she runs. But investors should be wary of executives spouting obscenities at critics — even the pesky blogger whom  Ms. Bartz cursed out on Monday. As Enron’s Jeffrey Skilling can attest, there’s a fine line between robust discourse and shooting the messenger. Salty language can sometimes be a mark of earthy candor or pugnacious leadership. And frequently such responses are provoked. That was perhaps the case with Ms. Bartz, who responded to a provocation from the Techcrunch founder, and Silicon Valley gadfly, Michael Arrington with an expletive. Still, that’s odd behavior to exhibit at a voluntary event sponsored by Techcrunch. There are two problems with Ms. Bartz’s response. First, any savvy Internet executive must surely know how   an unbuttoned-down response is prone to spread like wildfire on the Web. Indeed, having just announced a big tie-up with Nokia on the same morning as her intemperate retort, Ms. Bartz should have expected someone in the audience would have a cellphone set to video. But quite apart from the fear of getting caught is the more vexing question of Yahoo’s poor performance, which absolutely lends itself to saucy questions from shareholders and their quasi-journalistic proxies. Investors have little to show for the $47 million pay package that Yahoo dangled to bring Ms. Bartz in from the obscurity of her previous employer, Autodesk. Just do the stock market math. Since she was named to Yahoo’s top job in January 2009, Yahoo shares have rallied around 16 percent. Google has risen just over 50 percent. Even the Nasdaq has outpaced Yahoo by more than two and a half times. If Yahoo weren’t such a dog, Ms. Bartz’s response might be defensible. In light of the firm’s laggardly performance, however, it smacks of the same kind of desperation that led Mr.  Skilling to dress down  a hedge fund executive with a vulgarity in April 2001 for questioning the soon-to-go-bust firm’s financials on a conference call. Shooting the messenger is never a sign of strength. More often it is a sign of an executive trying to change the subject.

For the first time, the Bush administration is publicly discussing basing American troops in Iraq for years.
==::==
2007-06-03T00:00:00Z
==::==
WASHINGTON, June 2 — For the first time, the Bush administration is beginning publicly to discuss basing American troops inIraqfor years, even decades to come, a subject so fraught with political landmines that officials are tiptoeing around the inevitable questions about what the United States’ long-term mission would be there. President Bush has long talked about the need to maintain an American military presence in the region, without saying exactly where. Several visitors to the White House say that in private, he has sounded intrigued by what he calls the “Korea model,” a reference to the large American presence inSouth Koreafor the 54 years since the armistice that ended open hostilities between North and South. But it was not until Wednesday that Mr. Bush’s spokesman, Tony Snow, publicly reached for the Korea example in talking about Iraq  — setting off an analogy war between the White House and critics who charged that the administration was again disconnected from the realities of Iraq.  He said Korea was one way to think about how America’s mission could evolve into an “over-the-horizon support role,” whenever American troops are no longer patrolling the streets of Baghdad. The next day, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates also mentioned Korea, saying that establishing a long-term American garrison there was a lot smarter than the handling of Vietnam, “where we just left lock, stock and barrel.” He added that “the idea is more a model of a mutually agreed arrangement whereby we have a long and enduring presence but under the consent of both parties and under certain conditions.” Korea is an attractive analogy for the Bush White House for a host of reasons: a half-century later, South Korea is a raucous democracy and one of the world’s biggest economies. The North is a broken, isolated state, though one that, improbably, has not only survived for more than 50 years but has built a small nuclear arsenal. But Korea is also the kind of analogy that stokes the fears of those who see Iraq leading to unending war. The model suggests a near-permanent presence in Iraq, though presumably with far fewer troops than the nearly 150,000 now in place. In a Democratic-controlled Congress, which continues to press for a troop withdrawal deadline, talk of permanent bases is not welcome, though many Democrats acknowledge that the United States cannot simply leave Iraq in chaos. Nor is the idea popular in the Middle East, though some countries are desperate for a strategic  counterweight to Iran’s growing power. Critics on the left who have argued for years that the Iraq war was really about oil leap on such talk as evidence that the administration’s real agenda is to put its forces right on top of Iraq’s still-broken pipelines. Those who fear the next target is Iran — including the Iranians — will see the permanent bases as staging areas, in case the United States decides to take military action against Iran’s nuclear program and deal with the repercussions later. And the analogy rankles analysts who believe the situation is far less similar to Korea than it is to Vietnam in the ’60s or Beirut in the ’80s, where American bases became the No. 1 targets, and a rallying call for extremists, in an endless guerrilla war. “It’s not that Iraq isn’t vital,” said Leslie Gelb, the former president of the Council of Foreign Relations, and one of the many experts organized by groups opposing Mr. Bush’s Iraq strategy to shoot back in the analogy war. “It’s just that Korea bears no resemblance to Iraq. There’s no strategy that can create victory.” Historical analogy has been a problem for this administration since the start of the Iraq war in 2003. In the months before the invasion, there was talk of modeling a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq after the successful occupations of Japan and Germany. But even then, historians and analysts were warning against such comparisons, arguing that those were two cohesive societies that were exhausted by years of war and bore little resemblance to the fractured Iraqi society and its potential for internal violence. The core problem with the Korea comparison, many experts on Asia note, is that when the war ended in 1953, there were bright lines drawn across the 38th Parallel, separating the warring parties. That hardened into the formal Demilitarized Zone, exactly the kind of division that the Bush administration has said it wants to avoid in Iraq. And while there have been incursions across the Korean border over the years — a famous ax murder, underground invasion tunnels, a few commando raids by boat — those were mostly long ago. Nothing there has approached the Hobbesian state of chaos that is everyday life in Baghdad and Anbar Province. Some of Mr. Bush’s critics see an effort to reach for any comparison other than Vietnam. “If we can make this like Korea, then we have been successful,” said the Donald L. Kerrick, a retired general who spent 30 years in the military and has now emerged as one of a cadre of generals criticizing Mr. Bush’s strategy. He said that he did not believe the analogy fit. Mr. Bush himself has made clear, while in Hanoi late last year for a summit meeting, that he believes America’s mistake in Vietnam was that it gave up too early. “We’ll succeed unless we quit” he told a small group of reporters who asked him what lessons he drew for Iraq. He declined to engage in deeper comparisons, including the fact that President Lyndon Johnson’s dire warnings about what would happen if the United States pulled out of Vietnam — that Communism would spread across Asia — never came to pass. Administration officials and top military leaders declined to talk on the record about their long-term plans in Iraq. But when speaking on a not-for-attribution basis, they describe a fairly detailed concept. It calls for maintaining three or four major bases in the country, all well outside of the crowded urban areas where casualties have soared. They would include the base at Al Asad in Anbar Province, Balad Air Base about 50 miles north of Baghdad, and Tallil Air Base in the south. “They are all places we could fly in and out of without putting Americans on every street corner,” said one senior official deeply involved in the development of Iraq strategy. “And our mission would be very different — making sure that Al Qaeda doesn’t turn Iraq into a base the way it turned Afghanistan into one.” A long-term presence is envisioned by many experts, and it has been raised as a possibility by the Baker-Hamilton Commission, whose report on Iraq has now been embraced by President Bush — five months after he all but dismissed its conclusions. But the problem, as one senior administration official acknowledged last week, is that there is little reason to believe that American bases will stop Iraq from being  “the great jihadist training camp it is today.” As in Korea, the bases may be an effort to prevent calamity and invasion. The question is whether, in the firestorm of Iraq, their contribution to security would outweigh their roles as symbols of occupation or targets of terrorism.

Pyongyang’s promises to forsake future sales of nuclear technology must be vigilantly monitored and verified along with all of its nuclear activities.
==::==
2008-04-25T00:00:00Z
==::==
It is more than a little suspicious that the ever-secretive Bush administration has suddenly decided to go public with what it knows about North Korea’s nuclear connection with Syria. After seven months of refusing to acknowledge Israel’s air strike last Sept. 6 on a suspected Syrian nuclear reactor, the intelligence community has now provided Congress with video images showing North Koreans inside the secret facility. It is another example of this administration insisting that information be withheld for national security reasons — until there is a political reason to release it. So why now? It is no secret that Republican hard-liners are outraged over a State Department-negotiated deal intended to eventually shut down North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. They are desperate to stop it, either by getting President Bush to pull back or provoking the easily provoked North Koreans into doing something stupid, like walking out of the talks. Thursday’s presentation to certain Congressional committees will also make it harder to win approval for aid to dismantle North Korean nuclear facilities — an essential part of the agreement. As we said recently on this page, the deal is imperfect, not least because it does not require Pyongyang to come clean on the Syria deal. But at this point it is probably the best chance of moving North Korea toward a much more important goal: fully accounting for and eventually giving up its plutonium stocks and weapons. The North Koreans have already shut down their reactor at Yongbyon — the source of their plutonium — but there is a lot more work to be done. North Korea’s willingness to sell nuclear technology and know-how to Syria is extremely worrisome. Israel’s attack has at least ensured that the Syrian reactor will not be a threat. As for Pyongyang’s promises to forsake any future sales, that must be vigilantly monitored and verified along with all of its nuclear activities. Scuttling the agreement now will guarantee less transparency, not more, and will only increase Pyongyang’s nuclear appetites and its incentive to sell more of its wares. For six years, President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney refused to seriously negotiate with North Korea. The result? North Korea tested a nuclear device and went from having enough plutonium for one or two weapons to eight or more. We’ve seen that movie. The world can’t afford a sequel.

The only country with any chance of getting through to North Korea is China. Its decision not to act only makes the status quo more dangerous.

There is only one country with any chance of getting through to North Korea. That is China, the North’s major supplier of aid, food and oil. As tensions on the Korean Peninsula continue to spiral — frighteningly — upward, China is refusing to get involved. China has only one concern: avoiding any crisis that might unleash huge refugee flows. If it believes that the status quo is conducive to stability, it is mistaken. Relations between the Koreas have threatened to explode since last week when the South accused the North of torpedoing a South Korean warship, the Cheonan. It offered compelling forensic evidence of the North’s role in the March attack, which killed 46 South Korean sailors. What makes this so especially dangerous is that North Korea’s erratic leader, Kim Jong-il, is in a power struggle to ensure that his youngest son succeeds him. (American intelligence officials suspect Mr. Kim may have ordered the attack to prove his willingness to take on South Korea and its Western allies.) North Korea often blusters, but it has gone much further this time. Over the last few days, it has cut almost all ties and agreements with the South and threatened war if Seoul proceeds with threatened sanctions. On Thursday, it severed a naval hot line that was supposed to prevent clashes in disputed waters. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton tried hard this week to convince Chinese leaders of North Korea’s culpability — and of the need for Beijing to press the North to accept responsibility. There is no doubt about the North’s involvement. An international team investigated the incident, and South Korea has produced a torpedo propeller with North Korean markings. China needs to stop covering for its client and join in a United Nations Security Council statement that condemns the North’s behavior. Privately, Beijing should make clear to North Korea that any future acts of aggression will result in a cut off of aid. The United States, South Korea and Japan, which have taken a strong stand against the North, also must leave some room for Pyongyang to back down. The two Koreas — which have never formally ended their war — need to finally set a demarcation line in the West Sea where the Cheonan was attacked and sank. China could do real good if it worked with the United States to bring the two Koreas to the negotiating table.

Like Marie Myung-Ok Lee (“Picnic in North Korea,” Meanwhile, Oct. 27), I also encountered staged set-pieces designed to impress visitors during a visit to North Korea. Upon arriving at the children’s acrobatic theater in Pyongyang, we encountered a group of children merrily playing outside the entrance. Some were skipping, others charged around on roller skates, all were singing and laughing. The scene was so finely crafted that it was obvious something was amiss. Indeed, as soon as the tourists made their way inside the children dispersed. It was my view at the time that the group had been placed there for the specific purpose of creating a particular light-hearted and joyous atmosphere. My North Korean experience was full of these bizarre episodes, the most disturbing being the copious amounts of food provided to us at a time of reports of widespread famine in  the countryside.

China blocked a strong condemnation of North Korea for sinking a South Korean ship. Now it should use its influence to rein in Pyongyang.
==::==
2010-07-11T00:00:00Z
==::==
“Lowest common denominator” is too often the standard at the United Nations. Even then, the Security Council’s new statement on the sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan is absurdly, dangerously lame. The Council deplored the attack and expressed “deep concern” over the findings of an international investigation that held Pyongyang responsible. But it also took “note” of North Korea’s insistence that it had nothing to do with the incident Forty-six South Korean sailors died last March when the warship sank in disputed waters. Seoul quickly accused North Korea of torpedoing the ship but showed admirable restraint, inviting in an international team to investigate. The team did its work and agreed that a North Korean ship was responsible. South Korea produced a torpedo propeller with North Korean markings. Afterward, Seoul and Washington both condemned Pyongyang’s actions and vowed to obtain a similarly tough Security Council statement. But all in all, South Korea continues to exercise restraint. Which is why a clear condemnation from the Security Council was especially important. North Korea needs to know that such a brazen act of aggression will not be tolerated. And South Korea needs to know that there is diplomatic recourse in the face of such belligerence. China, which has veto power on the Council, insisted on watering down the statement. The Obama administration could not change its mind. Beijing fears that a political collapse in North Korea would send millions of refugees streaming into China, and it has a long history of enabling Pyongyang. Even after the North exploded two nuclear devices, China continues to be its major supplier of aid, food and oil — and continues to shield it from the full effects of Security Council sanctions. The statement “underscored the importance of preventing further such attacks or hostilities against” South Korea or in the region. But given the weasel wording about blame, it is hard to imagine that Pyongyang will listen. China has even more of a responsibility now to use its aid and its influence to curb the North’s excesses. The United States and its partners in the long-stalled nuclear talks with North Korea — Japan, South Korea, Russia and China — must look for other ways to ease tensions on the Korean peninsula. They can start by helping the two Koreas agree on a demarcation line in the West Sea, where the Cheonan was attacked.

SHANGHAI — The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that a North Korean border guard shot dead three Chinese citizens and wounded one last week in northeastChina, prompting the Chinese government to file a formal complaint. The shootings took place last Friday at the China-North Koreaborder by the Chinese city of Dandong, in Liaoning Province, said Qin Gang, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, at a regularly scheduled news conference in Beijing. The four Chinese were residents of Dandong, and the North Korean guard believed that they were engaged in illegal trade across the border, Mr. Qin added, according to a report by the Chinese-language edition of Global Times, an official newspaper. “China attaches great importance to that and has immediately raised a solemn representation with the D.P.R.K.,” Mr. Qin said, using the initials for North Korea’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. “Now the case is under investigation.” Mr. Qin gave the information in response to a question at the news conference about unconfirmed South Korean news reports on the shooting, but he did not provide more details. Nonetheless, Mr. Qin’s confirmation of the shooting and his description of China’s reaction were unusual, since China rarely upbraids North Korea in public. It was unclear how the shootings would affect relations between North Korea and China, which is North Korea’s closest ally in the region. China has been the host of the six-nation talks, a series of negotiations that also includes the United States, North Korea, South Korea, Russia and Japan aimed at curbingNorth Korea’s nuclear program. Last month, Kim Jong-il, the  North Korean leader, made hisfirst visit to Chinain four years, crossing the border by train and stopping  in  Dalian and then  Beijing. The actions of North Korean leaders have been made more opaque and unpredictable in recent months by what analysts believe is Mr. Kim’s effort toengineer a transfer of powerto his third son, Kim Jong-un, 27. China has come under pressure recently from the United States and South Korea to take a tough stand on what American and South Korean officials say was atorpedo attackon a South Korean warship in March that killed 46 sailors. China has taken a circumspect approach to the assault, to the disappointment of White House officials. China’s overriding principle on North Korea is to avoid actions that would lead to instability there, analysts say. North Korea’s economy is in tatters, and the North Korean government relies on aid from China to help alleviate widespread food shortages. China continues to engage in trade with North Korea, and Dandong is a hub for the transfer of goods between the countries. The Yalu River forms the border there, and Chinese tourists regularly cross into North Korea from Dandong to the North Korean town of Sinuiju and beyond. North Korean refugees also cross illegally into China in that area, often with the aid of Christian groups. North Korean border guards have been known to act unpredictably. In 2009, two American journalists  were detained by North Korean guards  near the Chinese town of Yanji.   They were released   after former President Bill Clinton traveled to North Korea.

The threat of North Korean missiles is being taken in stride by residents accustomed to a sense of vulnerability.

HONOLULU — Hawaii has long lived with the threat of wipeout, whether by tsunami, volcano or foreign invader. Now the Obama administration says North Korea could launch a ballistic missile in the state’s direction — possibly around the Fourth of July, according to the Japanese news media — prompting the United States military to strengthen defenses here. Antimissile interceptors are in place, the Defense Department said, and Hawaiians watched the other day as a giant, towering radar commonly known as the golf ball set out to sea from the base where it is normally moored. But if lifelong residents like Gerald Aikau are on any state of alert, it would be the one telling him that his octopus, caught in the waters here with a spear and his bare hands, is overcooked. “What are you going to do?” Mr. Aikau, 34, a commercial painter, said as he proudly grilled his catch at a beachfront park. “You are going to go sometime, whether it’s on a wave, or a missile, or your buddy knocking you down and you hit your head.” Vulnerability, and a certain fatalism about it, are part of the fabric of life in this archipelago, 2,500 miles from the mainland and, as many residents seem to have memorized since the Obama administration raised the alarm last week, 4,500 miles from North Korea. People took comfort in the heavy, year-round military presence provided by several bases here but also wondered if it made the state more of a target. In an interview Monday on CBS’s “Early Show,” President Obama, who was born and spent much of his youth here, said, “Our military is fully prepared for any contingencies” regarding North Korea. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates announced Thursday that the military had deployed ground-based interceptors and sea-based radar to help deflect any long-range missile from North Korea. Calls to Gov. Linda Lingle, a Republican, were referred to Maj. Gen. Robert G. F. Lee, the director of the State Department of Defense, who suggested that the threat was more saber-rattling from North Korea. He questioned whether its missiles had the technological capacity to go very far, but just the same, he said, the state was ready for hostile action. “Our military assets should be able to protect us,” said General Lee, whose duties include civil defense. “We, like all states, are prepared for natural disasters down to terrorism.” He said the state’s disaster sirens were working, and residents, as always, were advised to keep a three-day supply of food, water, medicine and other essentials in stock. “Out here by ourselves, we have to be a little more prepared, just in case help does not get here quickly from the mainland,” he said. Of course, the specter of Pearl Harbor still figures prominently here, as well as the cat-and-mouse of cold war maneuverings off the coast, including the mysterious loss of a Soviet ballistic-missile submarine 750 miles northwest of Oahu in 1968. “We are first strike from Asia,” said State Representative Joseph M. Souki, 76, a Democrat, who still remembers the wave of anxiety that swept his neighborhood on Maui as Pearl Harbor was bombed in 1941. “It’s not like we are in Iowa.” Still, he said, “more than likely nothing is going to happen.” “Hawaii is like a pawn in a chess game,” he added. The state can ill afford anything approximating a calamity. Therecessionhas been blamed for a nearly 11 percent drop in the number of visitors here last year compared with the year before. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in May reached 7.4 percent, up from 6.9 percent in April and the highest in three decades. The tourists that did come carried on as usual, taking surfing lessons, strolling Waikiki Beach and reflecting at the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial, where a park includes a display of old Polaris submarine-launched missiles. “Send one of these babies up,” Clifton Wannaker, 45, an accountant from South Dakota, said when told of the North Korean threat. He knocked on the missile’s skin for good measure. Standing at the shoreline in view of the memorial, Steve Brecheen, 54, a pharmacist from Oklahoma City, seemed a bit more unnerved. “North Korea seems the most unstable government as far as a threat to the U.S. is concerned,” Mr. Brecheen said. He motioned to the memorial, which sits over the remains of the battleship sunk by the Japanese in the Pearl Harbor attack. “In 1941, some of these people didn’t think the Japanese were an extreme threat, and they got their minds changed pretty quickly,” he said. But among Hawaiians, skepticism is mixed with annoyance and even anger that their state, hypothetically at least, could be a testing ground. “I think they would be stupid to do that test,” said Misioka Tauiliili, 39, a delivery truck driver, taking in the placid scene at a city beach near Waikiki. “The U.S. should go out there and shake them.” By that he meant the United States perhaps firing its own rockets in North Korea’s direction, “to test them.” Mark N. Brown, 49, an artist painting nearby, was less bellicose. He said he took comfort in the steps the military had taken and remained concerned that an act of aggression by North Korea would lead to war. But, with a wry smile, he added that a neighboring island, far less populated but a bit closer to North Korea, would probably take the hit. “It would hit Kauai,” he said. “We are on Oahu.” Mele Connor, 55, a lifelong Hawaiian shopping with visitors from the mainland at a clothing store in Waikiki, laughed off the threat. “After North Korea, it will be somebody else,” she said. “They know Obama is from here, so they want something. Everybody wants something from our pretty little islands.”

Obama&#8217;s new outreach foreign policy should continue, especially in dealing with North Korea and Iran.
==::==
2009-06-16T00:00:00Z
==::==
Springtime  has not been the best of times for Barack Obama’s  new out-reach foreign policy. First North Korea slams the door on any accepted agreement by testing a new atomic bomb  as well as the missiles that could one day deliver it. The carefully constructed six-party edifice  trying to woo Pongyang away from nuclear weapons with enticements and the threat of sanctions now stands in ruin,  with nobody knowing quite what to do. Added to that is the uncertainty of succession. Newsreels of  Kim Jong–il’s gaunt face and hesitant shuffle portray  the ravages of his stroke. Word has it that he has picked his youngest son, Kim Jong–un, as the next “beloved” leader of North Korea. Other than the fact that the young man  secretly skied  in Switzerland, no body knows what to expect from him. In Iran, however, everybody knows exactly what to expect from Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  —  another four years of belligerence. His dubious victory  collapses the hopes of Iranians who were sending  signals that things could get a lot better under Mir Hussein Moussavi who was considered the front runner. One cannot know whether the election was stolen, or won legitimately. Foreign observers are often lured into thinking  that the people they most see and talk to represent the prevailing opinion in an entire country.  Moussavi’s own polls may have been understandably optimistic.  In this case the educated elites in the capital, and the impatient urban  young, may have been  far more pro-Moussavi than the less-educated and rural population whose opinion is less sought and harder to obtain. And yet there is more than enough reason to doubt that the election was fair. As one of those who has been deeply involved with trying to improve U.S. relations with Iran,  the former Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering said to The New York Times: “This is the worst result. The U.S. will have to worry about being perceived as pandering to a president whose legitimacy is in question. It clearly makes the notion of providing incentives quite unappetizing.” The Iranian election will certainly give comfort to Obama’s critics on the right who see Obama’s outreach as  rewarding the axis of evil. It will make dealing with Israel’s staunchly right-wing government far more difficult, as former members of the Bush administration, such as the former U.N. ambassador, John Bolton, all but encourage Israel to attack Iran. The Iranian election will encourage Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to link  any progress on peace with the Palestinians to Obama’s progress with the Iranians, as he has previously suggested. His speech on Sunday continued his defiance of Obama’s plan to stop settlement activity. Avigdor Lieberman, Israel’s foreign minister, may have  chatted  in Russian with Vladimir Putin last week, but the  suggestion that Israel is going to use Russia to balance American influence  is a non-starter. Lieberman may wish he could deal with his Muslims as Vladimir Putin dealt with his  in Chechnya, but that’s about the extent of it. Ultimately, the  progress of any U.S,-Iranian dialogue will be up to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. It is by no means certain that he will totally reject Obama’s overtures, and if he was inclined to do so it wouldn’t matter who was elected president.  Change is unsettling, and the enthusiasm for change that so many Iranians demonstrated on the streets  in the run-up to the election must have been worrisome to the ayatollahs. If there was election fraud,  that worry may have been the reason for it. Secondly, Moussavi’s election would not have changed the outlook for Iran’s nuclear program. There is a consensus in Iran that uranium enrichment should continue, and the Western world may have to live with that. Obama’s outreach policy can, and should, continue. Nobody ever said it was going to be easy, or that there wouldn’t be setbacks. But there is no option of using force against North Korea, and it would be a colossal mistake to do so against Iran. America’s over-reliance on the use of force and threats as a substitute for a foreign policy  had run its course even before George W. Bush left office.

The U.S. cast doubt on the seriousness of North Koreas’s reported efforts to reassemble its main nuclear complex.
==::==

==::==
SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreahas begun reassembling its main nuclear complex, its only known source of bomb-making plutonium, the South Korean government said Wednesday, but the United States cast doubt on the seriousness of the North’s efforts. The North announced last week that it had stopped disabling its nuclear facilities at the complex, known as Yongbyon, and threatened to rebuild them because it was angry that it had not yet been removed from the United States’ list of state sponsors of terrorism. The United States maintains that the North has not fulfilled the requirements for being removed from the list. On Wednesday, Japan’s public broadcaster, NHK, and the Kyodo News agency reported that North Korea started reassembling its nuclear facilities on Tuesday. The reports cited unidentified officials related to the disarmament talks. In a statement from South Korea’s Foreign Ministry confirming that the North had begun rebuilding, a spokesman, Moon Tae-young, said: “Our government expresses serious concern because this goes against the movement toward denuclearizing North Korea and damages the six-nation process. We urge the North not to aggravate the situation any further.” But in Washington, the State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, said that the North Koreans seemed simply to be taking equipment out of storage and moving it around. “To my knowledge, based on what we know from the folks on the ground,” he said, “you don’t have an effort to reconstruct, re-integrate this equipment back into the Yongbyon facility.” Still, the Bush administration said it was dispatching Christopher R. Hill, assistant secretary of state for East Asia, to Beijing for talks on the issue. The North has often delayed and backtracked on commitments as a negotiating tactic, but if it begins rebuilding in earnest, it would throw into doubt President Bush’s hopes of cementing major gains in North Korean nuclear disarmament. Still, North Korea has not threatened to expel American and international nuclear experts from the Yongbyon complex. Last year experts from the United States and the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, together with North Korean engineers, began work to disable major facilities at the complex to at least temporarily shut down the North’s plutonium-based nuclear weapons program. North Korea is suspected of running a separate, clandestine weapons program using enriched uranium. The team focused on Yongbyon’s nuclear reactor, a factory that produces fuel for the reactor and a laboratory that can extract plutonium from spent fuel rods. Eight of 11 disabling tasks had been completed. The tasks remaining when the North halted the work were unloading spent fuel rods from the reactor, removing the reactor’s core and disposing of unused fuel rods. North Korea said it was beginning to rebuild the facility because Washington failed to keep a promise to remove the North from the terrorism blacklist once it made a declaration of its nuclear programs, which it did in June. In response, Washington repeated its demand that North Korea first agree to a comprehensive method of checking whether the nuclear account it submitted was complete. The United States  seeks intrusive inspections to determine how many nuclear weapons the North has produced and whether it keeps any hidden uranium enrichment program. On Wednesday Mr. McCormack reiterated the United States’ position. “North Korea understands very clearly what its obligations are, and needs to live up to them,” he said. “Part of those obligations are that it needs to complete work on a verification regime.”

The North Korean government allowed Renate Kleinle and Hong Ok-geun a 12-day reunion, 47 years after Mr. Hong was recalled from East Germany.
==::==
2008-08-10T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — Renate Kleinle and Hong Ok-geun met in 1955, when they attended the same freshman chemistry class at Friedrich Schiller University in Jena, in what was then East Germany. Mr. Hong was an exchange student fromNorth Korea, then East Germany’s Communist ally. They fell in love. Because both governments frowned on marriages between North Korean students and East Germans, the couple married in 1960 in a rural town where the local authorities were unaware of the national government’s policy. No guests attended. Then, one year later, politics intervened. The North Korean government, apparently worried after some students defected to the West, recalled all 350 North Korean students in East Germany. Mr. Hong was given 48 hours to pack. They both cried as she saw him off at the Jena train station. Their son, Peter, was 10 months old and in her arms. She was pregnant with their second son, Uwe. That was the last time the couple saw each other until this summer, 47 years after they parted. Mrs. Hong was allowed to travel to North Korea in late July after long negotiations between the German Foreign Ministry and the Red Cross and their North Korean counterparts. Mr. Hong is 74 and remarried. Mrs. Hong is 71 and never married again. Their two sons, who went along on the trip, are now 48 and 47. The family’s 12-day reunion was extremely unusual. North Korea remains one of the world’s most reclusive countries, and its leader, Kim Jong-il, maintains an iron grip on what the country’s citizens are permitted to learn about the outside world, especially the West. Most North Koreans have no direct mail, international telephone or Internet service. The government has allowed reunions of some Korean families divided during the Korean War, but they have been rare and many Koreans died before reconnecting with spouses and children. After Mr. Hong left Germany, he was able to send some letters. His last letter, dated Feb. 26, 1963, asked whether Uwe, the son he had never met, could walk yet. And then he wrote, “This sounds like a real goodbye letter.” After that, the letters stopped, and Mrs. Hong’s letters were returned as undeliverable. Her appeals to the North Korean Embassy to be reunited with her husband were denied. She kept a scrapbook that included pages on which she had practiced writing one of the few Korean phrases that she had learned, dasi bopsida — “Let’s meet again.” After decades spent working as a teacher and researcher and rearing her sons, Mrs. Hong renewed her efforts to find her husband two years ago when she appealed to the German government and Red Cross societies in Germany and South Korea. Early last year, the German Red Cross located Mr. Hong, a retired government scientist living with his new family in a town on the east coast of North Korea. With the help of the German government, Mrs. Hong wrote to him in March 2007. Four months later, on her 70th birthday, his reply arrived with photographs of him at a meeting of scientists wearing several medals on his chest. “Our international love brought us much pain,” he wrote in German. “I dearly wanted to see you and my sons. I never gave up hopes that if I lived long, one day I would be able to see you again. “I had wanted you to be my life partner,” he continued. “But politics do stupid things.” He added that he and other North Koreans were suffering economic hardship because of the United States’ policy of “stifling” North Korea, echoing the country’s Communist Party line. After two years of negotiations, North Korea agreed to a reunion, influenced perhaps by the establishment of diplomatic relations with the unified Germany in 2001 and German development aid. Finally, last month, Mrs. Hong and her sons left for North Korea. She took books, clothes, vitamins and a camera. When they met, Mr. Hong gave her a ring and a blouse. They pored over albums of childhood photographs of their sons. They saw each other every day while she was in Pyongyang, the capital, and spent time together at a mountain resort. “Because he didn’t have a chance to speak German for 47 years, he first found it difficult to understand me,” Mrs. Hong said. “But he quickly recovered his language skill. He is an old man now, but I saw no change in his manners and the way he spoke. We had private time just between the two of us.” Mr. Hong had one daughter and two sons with his North Korean wife. The daughter joined the reunion. Mr. Hong’s North Korean wife wanted to meet Renate but could not join the reunion because of an illness, Mrs. Hong was told. When the couple parted, Mr. Hong said he wanted to see her again next year, but it remains unclear whether North Korea will allow a second reunion. “My husband said he was sorry for leaving everything to me and thanked me for raising the two children,” she said. “He said it was his great honor in his life to meet me.”

North Korea said it would reopen an investigation into the past abductions of Japanese citizens. In return, Japan said it would lift some sanctions imposed on the North.
==::==

TOKYO —North Koreasaid Friday that it would reopen an investigation into abductions of Japanese citizens, reversing its longstanding position that the issue had been settled. In return,Japanannounced that it had agreed to lift some sanctions imposed on the North for its nuclear program, including the ban on travel between the countries, but that more serious sanctions would stay in place. The Japanese announcement, which followed two days of bilateral talks in Beijing this week, was the first sign in years of even a slight thaw between the countries. Although both sides made very minor concessions, they offered a possible way to resolve the abductions dispute, which has long complicated the six-nation talks over the North’s nuclear weapons program and has strained the relations between the governments in Tokyo and Washington. “With North Korea’s promise to reinvestigate, the process of resolving the abductions problem has resumed,” said Nobutaka Machimura, Japan’s chief cabinet secretary. “It’s a certain amount of movement forward, but it’s not overall progress.” Mr. Machimura added that Japan would not change its decision to remain outside of a six-nation agreement to provide North Korea with energy assistance in return for the North’s giving up its nuclear program. In a short statement, North Korea’s official news agency said only that the North “will reinvestigate the abduction issue.” But it gave no indication as to whether it would budge on its stance that there are no Japanese abductees left there, as Japan insists. Yang Moon-soo, an economist at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul and an expert on relations between Japan and North Korea, said the North’s shift on the abductions issue seems to have resulted in part from its improving relations with the United States. “North Korea desperately wants to be taken off the United States’ list of state sponsors of terrorism,” Mr. Yang said. “But Japan has opposed that unless the abductions issue was resolved. “The issue had become a bottleneck, so this is a step in the right direction,” he added. “But a lot will depend on how North Korea actually conducts this reinvestigation.” Of the participants in the six-nation talks, Japan has long taken the hardest line against the North and, to its bewilderment, has watched the Bush administration abandon its confrontational approach to the government in Pyongyang in favor of full-fledged negotiations since early 2007. The other participants are China, South Korea and Russia. North Korea also suggested that it may hand over Japanese radicals who hijacked a Japan Airlines airplane in 1970 and are still living in the North. For decades, the North denied responsibility for the disappearance of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s, despite Japanese news reports that agents had been spotted on Japanese soil. But during a visit to Pyongyang in 2002 by former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, the North’s leader, Kim Jong-il, admitted that North Korean agents had kidnapped 13 Japanese as part of a program to train Japanese-speaking spies. The North released five of them along with their children, but said the other eight had died over the years. Japan has said that it believes that some of them may still be alive and that there may be other abductees in North Korea. The abductions became a highly emotional and politicized issue in Japan, one used by the Japanese right to whip up anger against the North and to argue for Japan’s remilitarization.

The bank at the center of efforts to dismantle North Korea’s nuclear arms program challenged a ruling that bars the lender from the U.S. financial system.

==::==
SHANGHAI, April 16 — AMacaobank at the center of international efforts to dismantleNorth Korea’s nuclear weapons program today challenged aUnited States Treasury Departmentruling that bars the lender from access to the American financial system. Banco Delta Asia, a small, family-owned bank that the United States has accused of committing financial crime on behalf of North Korea, said in a statement that the March 14 ruling was “politically motivated” because it was based on disputes between Washington and Pyongyang. In its filing with the Treasury Department, the bank called for the decision to be revoked on the grounds that it was made without supporting evidence, ignored remedial measures the bank had taken and denied the bank the opportunity to respond to fresh allegations, the statement said. “In this filing, the bank seeks a fair hearing on all the evidence, free from political intervention and the distraction of public diplomacy,”  Banco Delta Asia’s New York-based lawyer, Joseph T. McLaughlin, said in the statement. “We are confident that the U.S. legal system, in the end, will not countenance the sacrifice of legal rights to political ends.” Banco Delta Asia had been expected to challenge the ruling after repeatedly denying any wrongdoing. The bank was drawn into the complex diplomacy surrounding North Korea’s nuclear weapons program when the Treasury Department in September 2005 accused it of acting as a “willing pawn” for North Korea in a range of illicit activity including money laundering and distributing counterfeit United States currency. In an effort to protect the financial standing of a city that has become a thriving gaming center, the Macao authorities stepped in to take control of the bank and froze about $25 million in accounts linked to North Korea. The bank’s owner, Stanley Au, a prominent Macao businessman and an advisor to China’s central government, has also repeatedly denied the American allegations. After an 18-month investigation, the Treasury Department ruled on March 14 that under section 311 of the U.S.A. Patriot Act, United States financial institutions would be barred from doing business with Banco Delta Asia. The impact of the Treasury Department’s September 2005 accusations clearly angered North Korea which boycotted the six-nation arms control talks for more than a year. After returning to the talks late last year, the North then refused to implement a Feb. 13 agreement to shut down its main plutonium-producing reactor until the frozen funds were returned. Macau authorities last week agreed to release the money but Pyongyang has yet to acknowledge this move or begin steps to shut down the reactor. In its statement, Banco Delta Asia said it had stopped doing business with all North Korean entities and had adopted more stringent antimoney-laundering policies. In addition, Macao authorities had enacted new antimoney-laundering laws, it said. “Notwithstanding these and other preventative measures, the Treasury Department adopted a rule barring U.S. banks from doing business with the bank,” the statement said.

North Koreacalled for an end to hostile relations with the United States in a New Year’s message on Friday, the official news agency KCNA reported. In a report on a joint newspaper editorial, the news agency said “the fundamental task for ensuring peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in the rest of Asia” was to end the hostile relationship between North Korea and the United States. The report also said that North Korea’s “consistent stand” was to work toward a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. President Obama wrote a letter to the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, last month to urge North Korea to return to nuclear disarmament talks.

Washington must shift focus from negotiating with Pyongyang to negotiating with Beijing about Pyongyang.
==::==
2009-05-29T00:00:00Z
==::==
BUSAN, SOUTH KOREA — Let’s look on the bright side: North Korea’s latest underground nuclear test should put to rest several misperceptions about the country’s motivations. It is no longer possible for anyone to go on claiming that everything Kim Jong-il does is an effort to get America’s attention, or that he just wants to go into the next round of disarmament talks with a stronger hand. Nor can anyone seriously argue that all these hugely expensive exercises are aimed at securing more economic aid. In short, it has become obvious that North Korea’s nuclear and military provocations and the escalating belligerence of its rhetoric are motivated by domestic political considerations instead. This does not mean that we must now waste time speculating about which of Kim’s sons will someday take over, or whether the army and the party are struggling for power. It hardly matters who succeeds Kim. All players in the elite are wedded to the same paranoid, race-based nationalism, without which the country has no reason to exist at all. Over the past 15 years the regime in Pyongyang has painted itself into an ideological corner  —   or, to put it better, it has pushed itself up to the edge of an abyss. Kim Jong-il shook off responsibility for economic matters in the mid-1990s in order to avoid public blame for the famine. The propaganda machine claimed that his new “military first” regime would henceforth be too busy defending the country from the Yankees (who in fact were sending aid at that time) to bother with economic issues. This line not only maintained support for Kim, but also enabled officials at the provincial level to begin dismantling the command economy. The West, of course, was overjoyed to note that the North Koreans no longer took all that Communist nonsense seriously. But the spread of capitalist values is what made the current string of nuclear provocations inevitable. Simply put, the more North Korea resembles a third-rate South Korea on the economic front, the more the Kim Jong-il regime must justify its existence through a combination of radical nationalist rhetoric and victories on the military and nuclear front. This is why North Korea will never disarm, for to do so would be to declare itself irrelevant. Some in the West are now suggesting that  North Korea’s nuclear capability must be accepted as a fait accompli, but that is no solution either. Needing constant tension with the outside world for his own political survival, Kim Jong-il is no more interested in winning international acceptance of his nuclear ambitions than in normalizing relations with Washington. The West must assume that he will always find a way to make his nukes unacceptable, while at the same time engaging sporadically in arms talks to keep the tension from tipping into all-out war. It is time for America to shift its focus from negotiating with North Korea to negotiating with the Chinese about North Korea. Beijing understands how vital these nuclear provocations are to Pyongyang’s survival, which is why it continues to bankroll them. Washington must therefore do more to assuage Beijing’s fears of a collapse of the Kim Jong-il regime. Let us remember how opposed the Soviet Union was to a unified Germany, until NATO came up with a promise not to station troops in the former East Germany. It would be a step in the right direction for the United States to assure the Chinese that they will never have to face American troops along the Yalu River. One thing is certain: We cannot simply wait for Kim’s death and hope for the best, because whoever succeeds him is going to need an especially dramatic military crisis to legitimize his rule. What we have seen in the past few weeks may well end up looking tame in comparison.

Brave conductors on a modern Underground Railroad.

CHINESE-NORTH KOREAN BORDER In an archipelago of safe houses here, part of a 21st-century Underground Railroad, I met groups of people who live every moment with sickening fear. These are North Koreans who have escaped to the “free world”  —  China  —  and are now at constant risk of being captured by Chinese police. The Chinese government, in a disgraceful breach of its obligations under the 1951 Refugees Convention, hands these escapees back to North Korea, where they face beatings and imprisonment, occasionally even execution. In one shelter is a 14-year-old North Korean girl: shy, sweet and terrified. Her parents led her across the frozen Tumen River from North Korea in the middle of winter, but then they became separated while trying to flee the police. “I don’t know where my parents are, or if they are even alive,” she said. Now a joint crackdown by the North Koreans and Chinese is greatly increasing the peril for people like her. The North Korean authorities used to detain citizens returned by China for a few weeks or months and then release them after a bit of “re-education.” But about a year ago, North Korea greatly increased the penalties. Now those returned by China are often sentenced to prison for several years, and repeat offenders or Christians can be sent with their entire families to labor camps for life. Some North Koreans told me that their government now holds regular sentencing rallies, at which the punishments are publicly announced  — or in extreme cases, such as those who became Christian evangelists while in China, the accused  are executed in front of the crowd by firing squad. One Christian I spoke to had been beaten so badly after his return by China that he tried to commit suicide by swallowing a handful of pins. The prison, not wanting to have to dispose of a corpse, freed him  —  and he eventually made his way back to China. “If he is sent back again,” said his wife, “he’ll be beaten to death.” China has also increased its punishments for its own citizens who are caught helping North Koreans. The penalty used to be a fine, but now it is jail for a year or two — or for a decade or more if someone smuggles escapees to South Korea. “Now most Chinese don’t dare help the Koreans,” said one local official who secretly protects a safe house full of North Koreans  — and who even stood guard outside as I interviewed them. “But I feel so badly for them. They’re just wretched.” With the help of incredibly courageous conductors on the modern Underground Railroad, I visited four shelters that together house dozens of North Koreans, and residents of a fifth shelter were brought to my vehicle so that I could talk to them safely. My entire visit was conducted under very tight security to make sure I did not lead police to the safe houses. The North Koreans I talked to described a society that is increasingly corrupt and disillusioned. One said that even with the latest crackdown, a $400 bribe to guards will win a prisoner’s immediate release. Another estimated that up to 20 percent of North Koreans in her area are disaffected enough that they listen illegally to Chinese broadcasts. Chinese and South Korean missionaries are also beginning to evangelize secretly in North Korea, a sign of weakening government control. One Chinese Christian I talked to had made four trips into North Korea to evangelize. “If I’d been caught, I don’t think I would have been executed,” she said, “but it wouldn’t have been good.” All the same, none of these North Koreans thought an uprising was imminent. Indeed, a surprising number of them are so steeped in propaganda that they still insist that “Dear Leader” Kim Jong-il is a good man. “The problem is with lower officials, not with Kim Jong-il himself,” claimed one man who has arranged for smugglers to bring his entire family out to freedom in China. (For more on the North Koreans, go to my blog,www.nytimes.com/ontheground.) President Bush should raise China’s breach of its international obligations with Hu Jintao. Mr. Bush might think of that 14-year-old girl, who spends her days minding two 9-year-old boys whose mothers were caught and sent back to North Korea. Those three children are modern reminders of the terrors of Anne Frank. They fear  with every footstep outside their door that China  will arrest them and send them back to their national torture chamber.

Diplomacy — backed by stiff sanctions — is the only hope for walking North Korea back from the brink.
==::==
2009-05-28T00:00:00Z
==::==
Erratic, frightening and hugely self-destructive. Those are the words we would use to describe North Korea’s behavior. First it defied the United Nations Security Council’s cease-and-desist orders and tested both a nuclear device and half a dozen missiles. Now it is threatening to launch military strikes against South Korea and may have resumed production of nuclear fuel. Given all of that, and the fact that no one is sure who is calling the shots in the North’s capital, Pyongyang, it is tempting to throw up one’s hands and say that there is no point in trying to negotiate. But there is no military option here. Diplomacy — backed by stiff sanctions — is the only hope for walking North Korea back from the brink. And for now, China — not Washington — is the prime player. It is time for China (host of the six-party talks scuttled by Pyongyang) to exercise the leadership it has long shirked. As the North’s main oil and food supplier, it has more leverage than any other country. We understand that China is worried that too much pressure could topple the government, pouring  refugees  over the border. Beijing should be able to calibrate that pressure. If not, North Korea will end up with a nuclear arsenal that could pose an even greater threat to China and the whole region. Already some in Japan and South Korea are arguing for their own weapons. The Security Council  displayed welcome unity on Sunday, condemning North Korea’s test and its missile launches. Now, it must impose new sanctions — and implement existing ones — on North Korea’s political and military elite: blocking luxury imports, freezing overseas bank accounts, and making it much harder for government-controlled companies to get the hard currency they need to do business. Pyongyang has already sold nuclear fuel technology and missiles to unsavory customers including Iran and Syria. And some analysts suggest, chillingly, that this week’s tests may be advertising. North Korea must be prevented from selling any more of its dangerous wares. South Korea’s decision to join the Proliferation Security Initiative — a voluntary group of 95 countries that shares intelligence and trains to interdict dangerous shipments — is overdue. North Korean officials need to be told quietly that Washington and its allies are not looking for a showdown, but they will redouble efforts to track those shipments and stop them if necessary. The goal of all of this is to get nuclear inspectors back into North Korea and North Korean officials back to the bargaining table. President Obama has said that he is committed to the six-party talks — which also include Japan, South Korea and Russia — and aides say to eventual bilateral negotiations. Those talks are North Korea’s only hope for coming in from the cold and ending its deep economic privation. Unfortunately, Pyongyang doesn’t see it that way right now, which is why the international response must be firm and skillfully choreographed. Loudly castigating and threatening North Korea and then failing to implement sanctions is worse than doing nothing at all. It will only embolden Pyongyang and send a dangerous message to others — Iran is surely watching — about the fecklessness of the major powers.

To the Editor: Re “Kim Jong-il’s Last Card” (Op-Ed, Oct. 8): Jason T. Shaplen and James Laney offer a rarity: a new idea on North Korea. China taking physical possession of Pyongyang’s fissile materials on the latter’s territory has consequences beyond their own assessment. One downside: if things ever get nasty, Beijing could give it all back. That’s unlikely, but the capacity would increase Chinese leverage vis-à-vis the United States in the region. On the upside, Beijing’s control over fuel and food spigots would impede Pyongyang from throwing China out as it did the International Atomic Energy Agency, locking in Pyongyang’s commitments and so facilitating an ultimate arrangement to remove the fissile materials from the country. China’s strengthened de facto security guarantee to North Korea plus United States reliance on China’s control of the fissile materials would increase both Beijing’s and Washington’s incentives to keep Korea out of play between them. Net result: a nearly denuclearized Korean Peninsula and improved regional cooperation. Not bad! Wade L.

CHINESE-NORTH KOREAN BORDER In an archipelago of safe houses here, part of a 21st-century Underground Railroad, I met groups of people who live every moment with sickening fear. These are North Koreans who have escaped to the “free world”  —  China  —  and are now at constant risk of being captured by Chinese police. The Chinese government, in a disgraceful breach of its obligations under the 1951 Refugees Convention, hands these escapees back to North Korea, where they face beatings and imprisonment, occasionally even execution. In one shelter is a 14-year-old North Korean girl: shy, sweet and terrified. Her parents led her across the frozen Tumen River from North Korea in the middle of winter, but then they became separated while trying to flee the police. “I don’t know where my parents are, or if they are even alive,” she said. Now a joint crackdown by the North Koreans and Chinese is greatly increasing the peril for people like her. The North Korean authorities used to detain citizens returned by China for a few weeks or months and then release them after a bit of “re-education.” But about a year ago, North Korea greatly increased the penalties. Now those returned by China are often sentenced to prison for several years, and repeat offenders or Christians can be sent with their entire families to labor camps for life. Some North Koreans told me that their government now holds regular sentencing rallies, at which the punishments are publicly announced  — or in extreme cases, such as those who became Christian evangelists while in China, the accused  are executed in front of the crowd by firing squad. One Christian I spoke to had been beaten so badly after his return by China that he tried to commit suicide by swallowing a handful of pins. The prison, not wanting to have to dispose of a corpse, freed him  —  and he eventually made his way back to China. “If he is sent back again,” said his wife, “he’ll be beaten to death.” China has also increased its punishments for its own citizens who are caught helping North Koreans. The penalty used to be a fine, but now it is jail for a year or two — or for a decade or more if someone smuggles escapees to South Korea. “Now most Chinese don’t dare help the Koreans,” said one local official who secretly protects a safe house full of North Koreans  — and who even stood guard outside as I interviewed them. “But I feel so badly for them. They’re just wretched.” With the help of incredibly courageous conductors on the modern Underground Railroad, I visited four shelters that together house dozens of North Koreans, and residents of a fifth shelter were brought to my vehicle so that I could talk to them safely. My entire visit was conducted under very tight security to make sure I did not lead police to the safe houses. The North Koreans I talked to described a society that is increasingly corrupt and disillusioned. One said that even with the latest crackdown, a $400 bribe to guards will win a prisoner’s immediate release. Another estimated that up to 20 percent of North Koreans in her area are disaffected enough that they listen illegally to Chinese broadcasts. Chinese and South Korean missionaries are also beginning to evangelize secretly in North Korea, a sign of weakening government control. One Chinese Christian I talked to had made four trips into North Korea to evangelize. “If I’d been caught, I don’t think I would have been executed,” she said, “but it wouldn’t have been good.” All the same, none of these North Koreans thought an uprising was imminent. Indeed, a surprising number of them are so steeped in propaganda that they still insist that “Dear Leader” Kim Jong-il is a good man. “The problem is with lower officials, not with Kim Jong-il himself,” claimed one man who has arranged for smugglers to bring his entire family out to freedom in China. (For more on the North Koreans, go to my blog,www.nytimes.com/ontheground.) President Bush should raise China’s breach of its international obligations with Hu Jintao. Mr. Bush might think of that 14-year-old girl, who spends her days minding two 9-year-old boys whose mothers were caught and sent back to North Korea. Those three children are modern reminders of the terrors of Anne Frank. They fear  with every footstep outside their door that China  will arrest them and send them back to their national torture chamber.

American intelligence officials have concluded that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, went into seclusion during the final buildup to the war in Iraq because he feared that he too might be the target of attack. That judgment has led the Pentagon to consider new ways to hold him and his inner circle at risk as a way of bolstering deterrence on the peninsula, officials say. Mr. Kim vanished from public view for 50 days starting in mid-February, a time when the Pentagon also moved bombers into the Korean area of operations. Now, the military's ability to mount precision attacks on leadership targets in Iraq is being examined to see how it might apply in a tense standoff with North Korea, perhaps influencing North Korea's behavior without ever firing a shot.

The State Department announced today that it would resume shipments of food aid to North Korea, ending a two-month hiatus, but that it intended to cut donations this year by 35 to 75 percent from last year's totals. Despite the cut, the announcement was clearly intended as a conciliatory gesture toward the new South Korean president, Roh Moo Hyun, who was inaugurated this morning in a ceremony attended by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell.

In a frank discussion, President Obama urged China’s president to put the North Korean government on a tighter leash after a series of provocations.

WASHINGTON — In a sign of mounting tension between the United States andChinaoverNorth Korea,President Obamatelephoned PresidentHu Jintaoand warned that China was emboldening its unruly neighbor by not publicly challenging its behavior, a senior administration official said Monday. In a frank, 30-minute discussion on Sunday night, Mr. Obama urged China to put the North Korean government on a tighter leash after a series of provocations,most recently its shelling of a South Korean island, which has stoked fears of a wider military confrontation in the Korean Peninsula. Mr. Obama, the official said, told Mr. Hu that “it was important for the North Koreans to understand that their actions would have consequences, including in their relations with China.” He reminded the Chinese leader of a tense meeting they had in Canada last June, after which the president publicly declared that China was guilty of “willful blindness” to North Korea’s military provocations. Since then, North Korea has lobbed artillery shells at South Korea, killing four people, anddisclosed the existence of a clandestine uranium enrichment complex. Still, China, North Korea’s most powerful ally, has not spoken out against the government. Even Mr. Obama’s phone call with Mr. Hu took several days to set up, though the White House insisted that it was a scheduling issue, not an attempt by China to duck the president. Mr. Hu did not offer any specific assurances to Mr. Obama, the official said, but he also did not complain about joint American-South Korean military exercises in the Yellow Sea. Nor did he suggest that the United States was partly to blame for North Korea’s belligerence because of its unwillingness to negotiate with Pyongyang. “The call was meant to be more forward-looking than pointing fingers at the past,” the American official said. Mr. Obama’s pressure on China was reinforced by a three-way meeting of the United States, Japan and South Korea at the State Department on Monday, at which they resolved to mount a united response to North Korea. The show of solidarity underlined the isolation of China, which has clashed recently with both Japan and South Korea, even as its relations with Washington have chilled over North Korea and other issues, including trade, currency squabbles andclimate change. In a coordinated series of actions, the White House is dispatching Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and a Pentagon delegation to South Korea and Japan to discuss ways to deter North Korea militarily. A high-level delegation from the State Department will travel to the region next week. “We would hope that China would work with us to send a clear, unmistakable signal to North Korea that they have to demonstrate a seriousness of purpose,” Secretary of StateHillary Rodham Clintonsaid at a news conference afterward, flanked by the foreign ministers of Japan and South Korea. Still, it was clear that the United States and China viewed the North Korean threat from different poles — the Americans convinced that it cannot be allowed to act with impunity; the Chinese fearful that a strong response would either cause the government to collapse or provoke it to even greater acts of violence. The United States has rejected China’s proposal for emergency talksof the six parties that typically meet to discussNorth Korea’s nuclear program. Mrs. Clinton said such a meeting did not make sense until the North Korean government took “concrete steps to change its behavior.” The South Korean and Japanese foreign ministers agreed, and echoed Mrs. Clinton’s call for China to take a more active role. “We would like China to have a clearer stance in giving warning to North Korea and to contain the provocative actions by North Korea,” Kim Sung-hwan, the South Korean foreign minister, said in Washington. The United States, analysts said, is taking its lead partly from South Korea, which under President Lee Myung-bak has mixed tough words with restrained action in responding to both the artillery shelling and the earlier sinking of a Navy warship, theCheonan, which killed 46 South Korean sailors. “It almost shows that there is a new cold war in Asia, with Japan, the United States and South Korea on one side, and China and the North on the other side,” said Victor Cha, a special envoy to North Korea during the Bush administration. Mr. Cha said the flurry of American diplomatic activity “sends a message to China: you can either stand with us, or you can stand with the North. That puts some subtle, or not-so-subtle, pressure on China.” Whatever the reason for the time it took to set up the presidential phone call, analysts in Beijing and Washington say it epitomizes the speed with which relations between Washington and Beijing have plunged into a freeze. This year has witnessed the longest period of tension between the two countries in a decade. And if anything, both sides appear to be hardening their positions. “The Chinese now feel broadly that where they disagree with the U.S., they can really say ‘no,’ ” said Kenneth G. Lieberthal, a China policy adviser in the Clinton administration who is now at the Brookings Institution. In Sunday’s call, according to a White House statement, Mr. Obama told Mr. Hu that North Korea’s new enrichment facility flouted commitments it made during the six-party talks on curbing its nuclear program, and urged China’s help in sending “a clear message to North Korea that its provocations are unacceptable.” One former Chinese official with close ties to the government dismissed the American approach last week as characteristically legalistic. The former official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the topic, said China’s strategy was to reassure the North Koreans about their security, not lecture them about diplomatic obligations. Indeed, China’s strongest public reaction to last month’s shelling was not to condemn the North, but to criticize Washington’s response — joint war games with South Korea that put the American carrier George Washington and its strike force in the Yellow Sea, off China’s borders. After Mr. Obama’s national security team met last Tuesday night, administration officials began saying that the United States would conduct more military exercises near North Korea and China should the North engage in further provocations. It was an unmistakable message to Beijing that failing to rein in its ally would only increase an American military presence that China loathes. The trilateral meeting in Washington sent another message, according to officials: that the United States will work more closely with its historic cold war allies in Asia to compensate for the rise of China. “There is a lot at stake,” Mrs. Clinton said, “and we are committed to working through all the challenges we face together.”

Regarding Celestine Bohlen’s “Telling Israel no: Obama’s bold move” (Letter from Europe, July 29): The Palestinians are not in any way, shape or form ready to negotiate; they are split in a million pieces. The Palestinian Authority  is corrupt and ineffectual; Hamas is terrorizing Gaza’s population; Gaza is hemmed in on all sides by Egypt and Israel; Iran is a  mess. What good does it do to pressure Israel on settlements when the other partner in the conflict is in never-never land? This has been the story all along.  The Palestinians refuse to negotiate seriously; the Israelis take more land.  In the end, there won’t be any land to negotiate over. Andrea Moriah,  Jerusalem James Carroll (“A shared Jerusalem,” Views, July 28) writes that “President Obama has replaced the Bush policy of hands-off with a gloves-off readiness to push all parties hard.” Can Mr. Carroll point to anything at all that Mr. Obama has done that  could be interpreted as pushing the Palestianians? Tuvia Fogel,  Milan Obama’s lack of leadership Albert Hunt (“What 1994 can tell the Democrats,” Letter from Washington, July 27)  is surely right that there is no Obama plan for health care. President  Obama does not make plans, he makes speeches  —  excellent speeches. Behind him, various kinds of Democrats, including the attractively named “Blue Dogs,” make the plans. Mr. Obama talks the talk and the Democrats in  Congress walk the walk. John Butler,   London A blunder by Clinton Regarding the report “U.S. and North Korea trade barbs” (July 24):  If the issue at stake had not been so important for regional security, one could almost find some comfort in the North Korean Foreign Ministry’s ability to display humor in its retort to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s derogatory remarks. It is regrettable that Mrs. Clinton, who referred to North Korea’s leaders as “unruly children,” allowed her personal feelings to overtake protocol. The credibility of U.S. foreign policy  once again has come into question. Jens A. Jorgensen,  Brussels

A growing army of nuclear abolitionists, concerned that proliferation could catch fire at any moment, is advancing the cause, led by Barack Obama, the first president to make nuclear disarmament a centerpiece of American defense policy.

Almost from the moment the first atomic bomb was detonated in New Mexico in July 1945, the menacing aura of the nuclear age has inspired visions of a world free ofnuclear weapons. Never more so than now, with the prospect that theTalibancould someday controlPakistan’s nuclear weapons,North Koreamight develop nuclear-tipped missiles, Iran may soon become a nuclear power and terrorists could get a bomb. A growing army of nuclear abolitionists, concerned that  proliferation could catch fire at any moment, is advancing the cause, led byBarack Obama, the first president to make nuclear disarmament a centerpiece of American defense policy. Last week, Mr. Obama was mired in the gritty business of trying to coax Pakistan’s president, Asif Ali Zardari, and the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, into a more cooperative relationship and a more determined fight against the Taliban and Al Qaeda. Administration officials did not sound sanguine about the prospects, and the White House meeting might well have left Mr. Obama yearning for a more promising long-term strategy to keep the Taliban away from nuclear weapons. Yet even as the allure of  disarmament grows, the obstacles seem as daunting as ever. Going to zero, as the nuclear cognoscenti put it, is a deceptively simple notion; just about everyone who knows nuclear weapons agrees it would  be wickedly difficult to achieve. That’s because it would require a sea change in a dizzying array of defense matters, ranging from core defense policies to highly technical weapons programs. To fully grasp the political and military implications, consider what would have been involved had the great powers of the 19th century decided to abolish gunpowder. Mr. Obama acknowledges that getting to zero won’t be easy. “The goal will not be reached quickly — perhaps not in my lifetime,” he declared last month before a huge crowd in Prague. “It will take patience and persistence.” But like other proponents, Mr. Obama has made the eradication of nuclear weapons a pivotal goal, no matter how distant, to provide a lodestar for world leaders and citizens alike. The new appeal of an old idea that long seemed quixotic is driven by the rise of new nuclear threats that in some ways make the nuclear equation more ominous and volatile than during the cold war, even though there are far fewer weapons now. Mr. Obamasaid it himself in Prague: “In a strange turn of history, the threat of global nuclear war has gone down, but the risk of a nuclear attack has gone up.” Nuclear conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union was a prospect so harrowing that American and Soviet leaders recognized it was untenable, even as their generals planned for Armageddon. They possessed some 70,000 nuclear warheads between them in the 1980s, but the weapons were under firm control and neither side dared risk the retaliation that a first strike would draw. The balance of terror, in effect, neutralized nuclear weapons. The dynamic today is much less stable, and more difficult for the United States to manage, as the turbulence in Pakistan shows. As the nuclear club expands, the security of weapons and technology diminishes. Terrorists would have no compunction about  using a nuclear weapon, and their target could not easily retaliate against an elusive, stateless group. Faced with these dangers, Mr. Obama is banding with fellow leaders like President Dimitri Medvedev ofRussiaand Gordon Brown, the British prime minister, to push for a series of steps to reduce nuclear threats in the near term, while preparing ground for the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons. The Obama administration and other advocates favor a reduction in American and Russian nuclear arsenals, to be followed by talks that include  nations with smaller nuclear arsenals, like China. They want the United States Senate to ratify the 1996 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; would strengthen the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty; and would seek an accord to verifiably ban the production of fissile materials intended for use in nuclear weapons. Sam Nunn, the former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, likens such steps to building “a base camp” that offers “a vantage point from which the summit is visible and the final ascent to the mountaintop is achievable.” It is an audacious agenda, but as alarm about nuclear threats rises, the chances of success seem to be growing, at least for some interim steps. Past efforts have foundered. A 1946 plan named after the American financier Bernard Baruch died partly because its scheme to have a powerful international agency control nuclear technology required the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council to give up their veto power on some nuclear matters. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, 41 years old now,  has proved ineffectual in moving the world toward nuclear disarmament. Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev briefly considered eliminating nuclear weapons, during their 1986 summit meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland. The idea died when Mr. Reagan refused to abandon his missile defense program. Mr. Gorbachev, still pushing hard for nuclear disarmament 23 years later, co-hosted an international conference on nuclear issues in Rome last month, a few weeks after Mr. Obama was in Prague. Mr. Gorbachev noted that nuclear disarmament would be untenable to many nations if it left America with overwhelming superiority in conventional military forces. That is one of the biggest potential sticking points. Nuclear disarmament would also upend decades of American defense strategies. Since early in the cold war, they have been pinned to the chilling concept that a nuclear attack on the United States, and perhaps a chemical or biological attack, would be answered with a devastating nuclear strike. Dismantling America’s nuclear deterrence strikes many defense experts as unwise, if not suicidal. They ardently believe that nuclear weapons have made global war less likely. Harold Brown, a former defense secretary, and John Deutch, a former C.I.A. director — both for Democratic presidents — argue that America will long need a potent nuclear arsenal for deterrence. They also suggest that the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons is a distraction from, rather than an impetus to,  more modest but significant steps to reduce nuclear threats. To counter such concerns, Mr. Obama promised in Prague that as long as nuclear weapons exist, America  would “maintain a safe, secure and effective arsenal to deter any adversary” and defend allies. How far can nuclear arms levels be reduced short of abolition while still providing deterrence? The United States and Russia are opening talks that seem likely to bring the number of operational strategic warheads on each side down to 1,500, possibly 1,000, from the present 2,200. Those numbers are generally deemed ample for deterrence. But the limit might have to go to 500 or fewer before  nuclear weapons states with smaller arsenals, including China, would start cutting. And thousands of American and Russian tactical nuclear weapons, designed for battlefield use, would have to be eliminated, too. At those levels, there is intense debate about whether American security would be gravely undermined. One solution suggested by abolition advocates would be a form of latent or virtual deterrence, based not on weapons all but ready to launch, but on the ability to reassemble or rebuild them. If arsenals are drastically reduced, the next steps toward abolition could be even trickier. Since scientific and engineering knowledge cannot be expunged from mankind’s memory, the potential to build weapons will always exist. Efforts to hide  a few  weapons may be difficult to detect and prevent. And any nation able to enrich uranium usable in nuclear power plants, like Iran, has a capacity to produce highly enriched fuel for weapons. Nuclear arms experts have been analyzing these issues intently and have come up with plans to address them. The steps include improvements in the tools used to monitor and verify compliance with treaties and new ways to prevent cheating, including more intrusive inspections. The enrichment problem, they say, could be solved by limiting the production of enriched uranium to internationally controlled fuel banks that would supply power reactors in places like Iran, eliminating the need for national enrichment plants. The notion of nuclear disarmament gained credibility a few years ago when four cold war veterans — George Shultz and Henry Kissinger, former secretaries of state; William Perry, a former defense secretary; and Mr. Nunn — overcame their political differences to endorse the idea in a Wall Street Journal op-ed article. Now that it has been embraced by Presidents Obama and Medvedev, the notion seems to be moving from the realm of fantasy to the hardscrabble world of policy and politics. How far it goes may depend on how much world leaders and the public accept the proposition, as Mr. Nunn sometimes says, that “we are in a race between cooperation and catastrophe.”

Nearly two decades after the United States stopped building nuclear weapons, it should not get back into the business.

With the Bush administration, no bad idea ever dies. So it should be no surprise that the Pentagon and the Department of Energy have released a new policy paper — pitched to the next president — arguing the case for a new nuclear warhead. Nearly two decades after this country stopped building nuclear weapons, it should not get back into the business. As the paper signed by Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman acknowledges, the current stockpile remains “safe, secure and reliable.” Any decision to build a new weapon would feed already deep suspicions about America’s judgment and motives and further undercut efforts to contain the dangerous nuclear ambitions of North Korea, Iran and other wannabes. The administration’s pitch sounds seductive. The proposed Reliable Replacement Warhead (how’s that for branding?) is supposed to be sturdy, reliable, secure from terrorists and not really new, just improved. And, oh yes, it’s supposed to contain fewer toxic materials. Officials also claim that if they get the new warheads, the government probably won’t have to keep as many backup warheads in the stockpile to hedge against technical failure — although nobody is making any promises. Officials also insist there will be no need to test the new warheads —  computers can model it all. The United States has not tested a nuclear weapon since 1992, one of the few arms controls taboos President Bush hasn’t broken. But Mr. Bush also rejected the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, so any promises about not testing the R.R.W. have always been suspect. The Pentagon became concerned about “aging” warheads only after it could not persuade Congress to finance a new “bunker buster” weapon to go after deeply buried targets. The nation’s nuclear weapons labs have long been lobbying for a new challenge to lure a new generation of nuclear scientists. But nuclear weapons cannot be a jobs project. Congress has wisely delayed financing a new warhead at least until a blue-ribbon study on nuclear weapons policy — led by two former defense secretaries, William  Perry and James  Schlesinger — is completed in December. Neither presidential candidate has categorically ruled out a new weapon. They both should. If the existing stockpile is “safe, secure and reliable,” there is no reason to build a new nuclear weapon.

The agreement between the United States and North Korea for the release of $25 million frozen in accounts in Macao has been rejected by the largest single account holder.
==::==
2007-03-27T00:00:00Z
==::==
HONG KONG, March 26 — A largely foreign-owned North Korean bank has emerged as a major obstacle to a deal that would allow six-party negotiations overNorth Korea’s nuclear program to move forward. The agreement between the United States and North Korea for the release of $25 million frozen for 18 months in accounts in a Macao bank has been rejected by the North Korean bank, Daedong Credit Bank, the largest single account holder. In two letters sent to the Monetary Authority of Macao, the bank has said that it will take legal action if any of its frozen funds are moved in accordance with the agreement reached between American and North Korean nuclear disarmament negotiators. The bank is based in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang. Resolution of the issue has been a stumbling block to carrying out an accord reached Feb. 13 that requires North Korea to shut down its nuclear programs in exchange for economic aid and diplomatic concessions. The United States has tried to solve the impasse over the funds frozen in the Macao bank, Banco Delta Asia, by offering to have the money placed in an account in the Bank of China under the control of  North Korea on the understanding that it would be spent for humanitarian purposes. A representative of the Daedong Credit Bank, which has about $7 million frozen in Banco Delta Asia, has told the authorities in Macao, though, that it will not accept its funds being placed under the control of North Korea or  moved to the Bank of China. Colin McAskill, who has agreed to buy Daedong Credit Bank and is representing the bank in its negotiations with the Macao authorities, warned the Monetary Authority of Macao in a letter on Wednesday that he would hold the regulator “totally responsible” and would “take whatever steps necessary” if the bank’s  funds were transferred without its consent. Mr. McAskill has sought a meeting this week with the chairman of the monetary authority, Anselmo Teng, to discuss how the money should be disbursed. The funds were frozen in September 2005 after the United States Treasury Department contended that they were the proceeds of illicit activities. At the time, the Treasury Department said that Banco Delta Asia, a small, family-owned bank in the Chinese territory, was a primary money-laundering concern. North Korean negotiators refused to participate in the round of six-nation talks on nuclear disarmament in Beijing last week because of delays in the $25 million being transferred into the Chinese bank. American officials attributed the delays to “technical banking issues.” “Daedong’s money must be separated from the political arena,” Mr. McAskill said. “We wish to leave the money in Macao until we can make arrangements to transfer it to one of our normal correspondent banks.” Mr. McAskill has also written to the chief North Korean nuclear negotiator, Kim Kye-gwan, seeking a written commitment that the  government has no claim over any of Daedong’s  funds or assets. Daedong contends that all of the $7 million it has frozen in Macao belongs to legitimate foreign businesses with joint ventures in North Korea. A delegation from the United States Treasury Department met Monday evening in Beijing with North Korea  to try to work out the transfer of the funds, including how to transfer the money from Banco Delta Asia to the bank in China without violating Chinese banking regulations governing illegal funds. The American delegation was led by James Wilkinson, chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., Daniel Glaser, a deputy assistant treasury secretary for financial crimes, and James Freis, a deputy assistant general counsel at Treasury.

American officials see the step by the Treasury as a crucial part of the recent deal to disarm North Korea’s nuclear program.
==::==

WASHINGTON, March 13 — The Treasury Department is expected to move formally this week to bar American banks from engaging in transactions with a bank inMacaolinked toNorth Korea, clearing the way for North Korea to regain possession of money at the bank frozen since 2005, a Bush administration official said Tuesday. American officials see such a step by the Treasury, which has been expected for weeks, as a crucial part of the recent deal to disarm North Korea’s nuclear program. The deal, announced last month, requires North Korea to disarm its nuclear facilities in return for economic and energy benefits. The Chinese government effectively froze about $25 million connected to North Korea a year and a half ago, when the Treasury Department listed Banco Delta Asia, a small family-owned bank in Macao, as a “primary money laundering concern.” As much as half of the money is expected to be returned to North Korea. American officials charged in 2005 that the bank was helping North Korea conduct counterfeiting, narcotics trafficking and transactions related to its nuclear weapons program, a charge that North Korea and the bank denied. The initial Treasury announcement put American banks on notice that after further investigation, the department would decide whether to bar United States banks formally from facilitating transactions with the bank. However, the practical effect was to make all United States banks voluntarily cease transactions with Banco Delta Asia. Without the ability to acquire dollars, Banco Delta Asia collapsed. Macao froze all its funds related to North Korea, and most of its other customers withdrew their money in a run on the bank. The bank was then taken over by the authorities in Macao, a semiautonomous province of China. Subsequently, American and Chinese authorities pored over more than 300,000 documents describing the transactions with North Korea. These included accounts of 20 North Korean banks, 11 North Korean trading companies, 9 North Korean citizens and 8 Macao-based companies that did business with North Korea, according to bank records filed with the Treasury Department. The Treasury announcement expected this week would formalize what is already in place. It would probably mean that the bank could do only a modest amount of business, without the benefit of dollar transactions. But it would mean that the Chinese government would be in a position to return some of the funds to North Korea that are not linked to counterfeiting, drugs, nuclear arms or other illicit activities. For example, some of the funds belong to a North Korean unit of British American Tobacco, American officials say, and those funds are expected to be returned to the company, which is owned by British interests. When the North Korea nuclear deal was announced last month, no mention was made of returning funds to North Korea from the bank, but American officials now say that the return of those funds was a major incentive for North Korea to reach an accord. The disarmament agreement was negotiated with the United States, China, South Korea, Japan and Russia as part of what were called six-party talks. Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs and the central envoy in the talks, said this month that North Korea was “concerned about the fact that we were able to go after an important node of their financing” but that the United States would continue to monitor its illicit activities.

TOKYO, Feb. 14 — South Korea seized upon the new agreement to freezeNorth Korea’s nuclear weapons program as an opportunity today to quickly resume high-level talks with the North, contacts that the South suspended with some reluctance after the North conducted its first nuclear test detonation last October. By contrast, the Japanese government struggled today to maintain its hardline stance toward the communist regime in Pyongyang. The new agreement, brokered at six-nation talks in Beijing that ran into the small hours of Tuesday morning, requires the North to shut down its main nuclear reactor in return for food and fuel assistance, and lays out a series of further steps toward nuclear disarmament and a lowering of tensions, in exchange for energy aid, relief of sanctions and more normal diplomatic relations. The South Korean government invited the North today to resume ministerial talks that were halted after the nuclear test, and announced that  officials from both sides had agreed to meet on Thursday in Kaesong, a city just north of the demilitarized zone dividing the peninsula. “What is very important about the agreement is that it not only resolves the North Korea nuclear issue itself,” said Roh Moo-hyun, the president of South Korea said, “but, in a further step, it includes a clause for discussions, negotiations on establishing a permanent peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.” In Tokyo, however, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was criticized today both by opposition leaders and by members of his own party over his government’s refusal to join in providing aid to North Korea under the agreement. Japanese negotiators said at the talks that  unresolved cases of Japanese citizens abducted by the North over the years must be cleared up beforeJapancan offer any aid.  Critics said that the government’s narrow focus on this issue, seemingly at the expense of regional stability, put it out of step with China, Russia, South Korea and the United States, the other parties to the talks. “We must not be isolated, and we are not in fact isolated,” Mr. Abe said in parliament today. “Other countries understood our decision not to provide oil unless progress is made in the abduction issue.” The Bush administration’s new willingness to negotiate with the North, and the deal that has resulted, has had ripple effects in Japan and South Korea, America’s two main allies in East Asia: At least for now, it seems to have freed South Korea’s hands and tied Japan’s. South Korea appeared set to fully resume its economic and diplomatic engagement of the North, a policy that had long strained its relations with the Bush administration and that drew severe criticism last year after the North provocatively test-fired new medium-range missiles, and later, its nuclear warhead. “It will be easier for President Roh to carry out his engagement policy now, maybe even further than he ever had,” said Shin Jung-wha, a political scientist at Dongseo University in Pusan, South Korea. The deal also made it more unlikely that South Korea would alter that policy after the presidential election coming in December, even if the conservative opposition wins that vote. “Many Koreans feel that President Roh has been too lenient on North Korea,” Ms. Shin said. “But there is a national consensus on the engagement policy, and if the conservatives gain power next December, there might be a few tweaks, but no fundamental change in the policy.” In Japan’s case, Mr. Abe’s government insisted on tying the nuclear talks to the cases of Japanese citizens abducted by the North in the 1970’s. The North has acknowledged kidnapping a dozen Japanese: it returned five survivors in 2003 and said the rest of the abductees had died. But Japan says more survivors remain in the North. Mr. Abe made his political career by championing the abduction issue; critics say he has exploited it to stir up nationalist sentiments in Japan. Analysts say it would be difficult for Mr. Abe, whose approval ratings have slipped badly after a series of scandals and gaffes, to compromise now on the abduction issue. At the same time, refusing to join in aiding the North under the accord may expose Japan to accusations that it is putting regional stability at risk over a parochial  issue. “Japan should be conducting diplomacy with a broader perspective,” said Makoto Taniguchi, president of Iwate Prefectural University in Japan and a former senior diplomat. “It should be thinking of Asian security and peace. If Japan thinks narrowly, only of its relations with the United States at the expense of its relations with its neighbors, it will find itself excluded. “Japanese diplomacy has, so to speak, been abducted by the abduction issue,” Mr. Taniguchi said. The Japanese government said it hoped to address the abduction issue in a working group to be established under the accord, aimed at normalizing relations between Japan and North Korea. Tokyo has said in the past that it could not establish normal relations or pay  reparations for its colonial rule of Korea before World War II unless the abducted Japanese citizens were accounted for. But Japan’s emphasis on the abductions in the working group is likely to bring forth a long list of historical grievances from North Korea. A North Korean foreign ministry official, Ri Pyong-dok, told Japan’s Kyodo News that the North’s focus in the working group will be on Japan’s colonial rule. “The settlement of crimes committed by Japan is a priority,” Mr. Ri said. “Without that, there will be no normalization of relations between the two countries.”

In a frank discussion, President Obama urged China’s president to put the North Korean government on a tighter leash after a series of provocations.

WASHINGTON — In a sign of mounting tension between the United States andChinaoverNorth Korea,President Obamatelephoned PresidentHu Jintaoand warned that China was emboldening its unruly neighbor by not publicly challenging its behavior, a senior administration official said Monday. In a frank, 30-minute discussion on Sunday night, Mr. Obama urged China to put the North Korean government on a tighter leash after a series of provocations,most recently its shelling of a South Korean island, which has stoked fears of a wider military confrontation in the Korean Peninsula. Mr. Obama, the official said, told Mr. Hu that “it was important for the North Koreans to understand that their actions would have consequences, including in their relations with China.” He reminded the Chinese leader of a tense meeting they had in Canada last June, after which the president publicly declared that China was guilty of “willful blindness” to North Korea’s military provocations. Since then, North Korea has lobbed artillery shells at South Korea, killing four people, anddisclosed the existence of a clandestine uranium enrichment complex. Still, China, North Korea’s most powerful ally, has not spoken out against the government. Even Mr. Obama’s phone call with Mr. Hu took several days to set up, though the White House insisted that it was a scheduling issue, not an attempt by China to duck the president. Mr. Hu did not offer any specific assurances to Mr. Obama, the official said, but he also did not complain about joint American-South Korean military exercises in the Yellow Sea. Nor did he suggest that the United States was partly to blame for North Korea’s belligerence because of its unwillingness to negotiate with Pyongyang. “The call was meant to be more forward-looking than pointing fingers at the past,” the American official said. Mr. Obama’s pressure on China was reinforced by a three-way meeting of the United States, Japan and South Korea at the State Department on Monday, at which they resolved to mount a united response to North Korea. The show of solidarity underlined the isolation of China, which has clashed recently with both Japan and South Korea, even as its relations with Washington have chilled over North Korea and other issues, including trade, currency squabbles andclimate change. In a coordinated series of actions, the White House is dispatching Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and a Pentagon delegation to South Korea and Japan to discuss ways to deter North Korea militarily. A high-level delegation from the State Department will travel to the region next week. “We would hope that China would work with us to send a clear, unmistakable signal to North Korea that they have to demonstrate a seriousness of purpose,” Secretary of StateHillary Rodham Clintonsaid at a news conference afterward, flanked by the foreign ministers of Japan and South Korea. Still, it was clear that the United States and China viewed the North Korean threat from different poles — the Americans convinced that it cannot be allowed to act with impunity; the Chinese fearful that a strong response would either cause the government to collapse or provoke it to even greater acts of violence. The United States has rejected China’s proposal for emergency talksof the six parties that typically meet to discussNorth Korea’s nuclear program. Mrs. Clinton said such a meeting did not make sense until the North Korean government took “concrete steps to change its behavior.” The South Korean and Japanese foreign ministers agreed, and echoed Mrs. Clinton’s call for China to take a more active role. “We would like China to have a clearer stance in giving warning to North Korea and to contain the provocative actions by North Korea,” Kim Sung-hwan, the South Korean foreign minister, said in Washington. The United States, analysts said, is taking its lead partly from South Korea, which under President Lee Myung-bak has mixed tough words with restrained action in responding to both the artillery shelling and the earlier sinking of a Navy warship, theCheonan, which killed 46 South Korean sailors. “It almost shows that there is a new cold war in Asia, with Japan, the United States and South Korea on one side, and China and the North on the other side,” said Victor Cha, a special envoy to North Korea during the Bush administration. Mr. Cha said the flurry of American diplomatic activity “sends a message to China: you can either stand with us, or you can stand with the North. That puts some subtle, or not-so-subtle, pressure on China.” Whatever the reason for the time it took to set up the presidential phone call, analysts in Beijing and Washington say it epitomizes the speed with which relations between Washington and Beijing have plunged into a freeze. This year has witnessed the longest period of tension between the two countries in a decade. And if anything, both sides appear to be hardening their positions. “The Chinese now feel broadly that where they disagree with the U.S., they can really say ‘no,’ ” said Kenneth G. Lieberthal, a China policy adviser in the Clinton administration who is now at the Brookings Institution. In Sunday’s call, according to a White House statement, Mr. Obama told Mr. Hu that North Korea’s new enrichment facility flouted commitments it made during the six-party talks on curbing its nuclear program, and urged China’s help in sending “a clear message to North Korea that its provocations are unacceptable.” One former Chinese official with close ties to the government dismissed the American approach last week as characteristically legalistic. The former official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the topic, said China’s strategy was to reassure the North Koreans about their security, not lecture them about diplomatic obligations. Indeed, China’s strongest public reaction to last month’s shelling was not to condemn the North, but to criticize Washington’s response — joint war games with South Korea that put the American carrier George Washington and its strike force in the Yellow Sea, off China’s borders. After Mr. Obama’s national security team met last Tuesday night, administration officials began saying that the United States would conduct more military exercises near North Korea and China should the North engage in further provocations. It was an unmistakable message to Beijing that failing to rein in its ally would only increase an American military presence that China loathes. The trilateral meeting in Washington sent another message, according to officials: that the United States will work more closely with its historic cold war allies in Asia to compensate for the rise of China. “There is a lot at stake,” Mrs. Clinton said, “and we are committed to working through all the challenges we face together.”

Regarding Celestine Bohlen’s “Telling Israel no: Obama’s bold move” (Letter from Europe, July 29): The Palestinians are not in any way, shape or form ready to negotiate; they are split in a million pieces. The Palestinian Authority  is corrupt and ineffectual; Hamas is terrorizing Gaza’s population; Gaza is hemmed in on all sides by Egypt and Israel; Iran is a  mess. What good does it do to pressure Israel on settlements when the other partner in the conflict is in never-never land? This has been the story all along.  The Palestinians refuse to negotiate seriously; the Israelis take more land.  In the end, there won’t be any land to negotiate over. Andrea Moriah,  Jerusalem James Carroll (“A shared Jerusalem,” Views, July 28) writes that “President Obama has replaced the Bush policy of hands-off with a gloves-off readiness to push all parties hard.” Can Mr. Carroll point to anything at all that Mr. Obama has done that  could be interpreted as pushing the Palestianians? Tuvia Fogel,  Milan Obama’s lack of leadership Albert Hunt (“What 1994 can tell the Democrats,” Letter from Washington, July 27)  is surely right that there is no Obama plan for health care. President  Obama does not make plans, he makes speeches  —  excellent speeches. Behind him, various kinds of Democrats, including the attractively named “Blue Dogs,” make the plans. Mr. Obama talks the talk and the Democrats in  Congress walk the walk. John Butler,   London A blunder by Clinton Regarding the report “U.S. and North Korea trade barbs” (July 24):  If the issue at stake had not been so important for regional security, one could almost find some comfort in the North Korean Foreign Ministry’s ability to display humor in its retort to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s derogatory remarks. It is regrettable that Mrs. Clinton, who referred to North Korea’s leaders as “unruly children,” allowed her personal feelings to overtake protocol. The credibility of U.S. foreign policy  once again has come into question. Jens A. Jorgensen,  Brussels

A growing army of nuclear abolitionists, concerned that proliferation could catch fire at any moment, is advancing the cause, led by Barack Obama, the first president to make nuclear disarmament a centerpiece of American defense policy.

Almost from the moment the first atomic bomb was detonated in New Mexico in July 1945, the menacing aura of the nuclear age has inspired visions of a world free ofnuclear weapons. Never more so than now, with the prospect that theTalibancould someday controlPakistan’s nuclear weapons,North Koreamight develop nuclear-tipped missiles, Iran may soon become a nuclear power and terrorists could get a bomb. A growing army of nuclear abolitionists, concerned that  proliferation could catch fire at any moment, is advancing the cause, led byBarack Obama, the first president to make nuclear disarmament a centerpiece of American defense policy. Last week, Mr. Obama was mired in the gritty business of trying to coax Pakistan’s president, Asif Ali Zardari, and the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, into a more cooperative relationship and a more determined fight against the Taliban and Al Qaeda. Administration officials did not sound sanguine about the prospects, and the White House meeting might well have left Mr. Obama yearning for a more promising long-term strategy to keep the Taliban away from nuclear weapons. Yet even as the allure of  disarmament grows, the obstacles seem as daunting as ever. Going to zero, as the nuclear cognoscenti put it, is a deceptively simple notion; just about everyone who knows nuclear weapons agrees it would  be wickedly difficult to achieve. That’s because it would require a sea change in a dizzying array of defense matters, ranging from core defense policies to highly technical weapons programs. To fully grasp the political and military implications, consider what would have been involved had the great powers of the 19th century decided to abolish gunpowder. Mr. Obama acknowledges that getting to zero won’t be easy. “The goal will not be reached quickly — perhaps not in my lifetime,” he declared last month before a huge crowd in Prague. “It will take patience and persistence.” But like other proponents, Mr. Obama has made the eradication of nuclear weapons a pivotal goal, no matter how distant, to provide a lodestar for world leaders and citizens alike. The new appeal of an old idea that long seemed quixotic is driven by the rise of new nuclear threats that in some ways make the nuclear equation more ominous and volatile than during the cold war, even though there are far fewer weapons now. Mr. Obamasaid it himself in Prague: “In a strange turn of history, the threat of global nuclear war has gone down, but the risk of a nuclear attack has gone up.” Nuclear conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union was a prospect so harrowing that American and Soviet leaders recognized it was untenable, even as their generals planned for Armageddon. They possessed some 70,000 nuclear warheads between them in the 1980s, but the weapons were under firm control and neither side dared risk the retaliation that a first strike would draw. The balance of terror, in effect, neutralized nuclear weapons. The dynamic today is much less stable, and more difficult for the United States to manage, as the turbulence in Pakistan shows. As the nuclear club expands, the security of weapons and technology diminishes. Terrorists would have no compunction about  using a nuclear weapon, and their target could not easily retaliate against an elusive, stateless group. Faced with these dangers, Mr. Obama is banding with fellow leaders like President Dimitri Medvedev ofRussiaand Gordon Brown, the British prime minister, to push for a series of steps to reduce nuclear threats in the near term, while preparing ground for the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons. The Obama administration and other advocates favor a reduction in American and Russian nuclear arsenals, to be followed by talks that include  nations with smaller nuclear arsenals, like China. They want the United States Senate to ratify the 1996 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; would strengthen the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty; and would seek an accord to verifiably ban the production of fissile materials intended for use in nuclear weapons. Sam Nunn, the former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, likens such steps to building “a base camp” that offers “a vantage point from which the summit is visible and the final ascent to the mountaintop is achievable.” It is an audacious agenda, but as alarm about nuclear threats rises, the chances of success seem to be growing, at least for some interim steps. Past efforts have foundered. A 1946 plan named after the American financier Bernard Baruch died partly because its scheme to have a powerful international agency control nuclear technology required the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council to give up their veto power on some nuclear matters. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, 41 years old now,  has proved ineffectual in moving the world toward nuclear disarmament. Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev briefly considered eliminating nuclear weapons, during their 1986 summit meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland. The idea died when Mr. Reagan refused to abandon his missile defense program. Mr. Gorbachev, still pushing hard for nuclear disarmament 23 years later, co-hosted an international conference on nuclear issues in Rome last month, a few weeks after Mr. Obama was in Prague. Mr. Gorbachev noted that nuclear disarmament would be untenable to many nations if it left America with overwhelming superiority in conventional military forces. That is one of the biggest potential sticking points. Nuclear disarmament would also upend decades of American defense strategies. Since early in the cold war, they have been pinned to the chilling concept that a nuclear attack on the United States, and perhaps a chemical or biological attack, would be answered with a devastating nuclear strike. Dismantling America’s nuclear deterrence strikes many defense experts as unwise, if not suicidal. They ardently believe that nuclear weapons have made global war less likely. Harold Brown, a former defense secretary, and John Deutch, a former C.I.A. director — both for Democratic presidents — argue that America will long need a potent nuclear arsenal for deterrence. They also suggest that the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons is a distraction from, rather than an impetus to,  more modest but significant steps to reduce nuclear threats. To counter such concerns, Mr. Obama promised in Prague that as long as nuclear weapons exist, America  would “maintain a safe, secure and effective arsenal to deter any adversary” and defend allies. How far can nuclear arms levels be reduced short of abolition while still providing deterrence? The United States and Russia are opening talks that seem likely to bring the number of operational strategic warheads on each side down to 1,500, possibly 1,000, from the present 2,200. Those numbers are generally deemed ample for deterrence. But the limit might have to go to 500 or fewer before  nuclear weapons states with smaller arsenals, including China, would start cutting. And thousands of American and Russian tactical nuclear weapons, designed for battlefield use, would have to be eliminated, too. At those levels, there is intense debate about whether American security would be gravely undermined. One solution suggested by abolition advocates would be a form of latent or virtual deterrence, based not on weapons all but ready to launch, but on the ability to reassemble or rebuild them. If arsenals are drastically reduced, the next steps toward abolition could be even trickier. Since scientific and engineering knowledge cannot be expunged from mankind’s memory, the potential to build weapons will always exist. Efforts to hide  a few  weapons may be difficult to detect and prevent. And any nation able to enrich uranium usable in nuclear power plants, like Iran, has a capacity to produce highly enriched fuel for weapons. Nuclear arms experts have been analyzing these issues intently and have come up with plans to address them. The steps include improvements in the tools used to monitor and verify compliance with treaties and new ways to prevent cheating, including more intrusive inspections. The enrichment problem, they say, could be solved by limiting the production of enriched uranium to internationally controlled fuel banks that would supply power reactors in places like Iran, eliminating the need for national enrichment plants. The notion of nuclear disarmament gained credibility a few years ago when four cold war veterans — George Shultz and Henry Kissinger, former secretaries of state; William Perry, a former defense secretary; and Mr. Nunn — overcame their political differences to endorse the idea in a Wall Street Journal op-ed article. Now that it has been embraced by Presidents Obama and Medvedev, the notion seems to be moving from the realm of fantasy to the hardscrabble world of policy and politics. How far it goes may depend on how much world leaders and the public accept the proposition, as Mr. Nunn sometimes says, that “we are in a race between cooperation and catastrophe.”

Nearly two decades after the United States stopped building nuclear weapons, it should not get back into the business.

With the Bush administration, no bad idea ever dies. So it should be no surprise that the Pentagon and the Department of Energy have released a new policy paper — pitched to the next president — arguing the case for a new nuclear warhead. Nearly two decades after this country stopped building nuclear weapons, it should not get back into the business. As the paper signed by Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman acknowledges, the current stockpile remains “safe, secure and reliable.” Any decision to build a new weapon would feed already deep suspicions about America’s judgment and motives and further undercut efforts to contain the dangerous nuclear ambitions of North Korea, Iran and other wannabes. The administration’s pitch sounds seductive. The proposed Reliable Replacement Warhead (how’s that for branding?) is supposed to be sturdy, reliable, secure from terrorists and not really new, just improved. And, oh yes, it’s supposed to contain fewer toxic materials. Officials also claim that if they get the new warheads, the government probably won’t have to keep as many backup warheads in the stockpile to hedge against technical failure — although nobody is making any promises. Officials also insist there will be no need to test the new warheads —  computers can model it all. The United States has not tested a nuclear weapon since 1992, one of the few arms controls taboos President Bush hasn’t broken. But Mr. Bush also rejected the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, so any promises about not testing the R.R.W. have always been suspect. The Pentagon became concerned about “aging” warheads only after it could not persuade Congress to finance a new “bunker buster” weapon to go after deeply buried targets. The nation’s nuclear weapons labs have long been lobbying for a new challenge to lure a new generation of nuclear scientists. But nuclear weapons cannot be a jobs project. Congress has wisely delayed financing a new warhead at least until a blue-ribbon study on nuclear weapons policy — led by two former defense secretaries, William  Perry and James  Schlesinger — is completed in December. Neither presidential candidate has categorically ruled out a new weapon. They both should. If the existing stockpile is “safe, secure and reliable,” there is no reason to build a new nuclear weapon.

The Bush administration’s recent concessions to Iran, North Korea and Iraq have further muddled the old message that the U.S. would not talk to its foes.

WASHINGTON — When Secretary of StateCondoleezza Ricemeets her North Korean counterpart, Pak Ui-chun, in Singapore this week, it will be the first high-level meeting between Washington and the North since 2004, when Ms. Rice’s predecessor, Colin L. Powell, met with his North Korean counterpart. It will be the third meeting since Madeleine K. Albright visitedNorth Korea’s leader,Kim Jong-il, during the waning months of the Clinton administration. After a weekend in which the Bush administration sent a top State Department official to a meeting in Geneva with an Iranian official, the North Korea meeting may well amount to last rites for the “axis of evil,” the one that President Bush said in 2002 was “arming to threaten the peace of the world.” The Bush administration began long ago to step down from its vow not to talk to America’s foes. But its recent concessions toIranand North Korea — and toIraq, another charter member of the axis — have further muddled the old message. Mr. Bush has now agreed, in principle, to the idea of a timetable for troop withdrawals from Iraq, something he has long derided as dangerous. The State Department sent Under Secretary of State William J. Burns to talk to Iranian and European officials in Geneva, despite having said it would enter such talks only if Tehran suspended its enrichment of uranium, which Iran has not done. And now, Ms. Rice will meet with Mr. Pak to finalize a phase in a denuclearization agreement less than two years after North Korea tested a nuclear weapon. The White House maintained on Monday that nothing had changed. When pressed by a reporter on whether Mr. Bush still believed that North Korea and Iran were part of an axis of evil, Dana M. Perino, the White House press secretary, said they were. “I think that until they give up their nuclear weapons programs completely and verifiably, I think that we would keep them in the same category,” Ms. Perino said. And Ms. Rice herself, two days after the Geneva talks on Iran, described them as disappointing. “We expected to hear an answer from the Iranians, but as has been the case so many times with the Iranians, what came through was not serious,” she said aboard her flight to Abu Dhabi for talks before heading to Singapore. She said that if Iran did not respond in the next two weeks to an offer of incentives, the United States and other major powers would go back to the United Nations Security Council for additional sanctions against Tehran. America’s European allies and even a few members of the Bush administration have been struck by what they call a zigzag. A senior administration official described the Iran policy as “erratic,” while a European diplomat said, “It does seem a bit schizophrenic.” Abbas Milani, an Iran expert at Stanford University who has advised the Bush administration, echoed the sentiment. “I don’t understand what they’re doing,” Mr. Milani said. Ms. Rice’s “provocative acts and words” on Monday could derail any chance that Iran’s leaders might reward the Bush concession on talks by suspending uranium enrichment, he said. Some foreign policy experts said the multiplying concessions were to be expected in the waning months of any administration. The Reagan administration, for instance, began formal talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1988 during its last months in office, and President Clinton sent Ms. Albright to Pyongyang in late 2000, less than three months before he left office. But the Bush administration’s concessions are particularly noteworthy because Mr. Bush and his deputies went to great lengths to propound an intellectual and moral doctrine that eschewed talking to foes; Mr. Bush compared such outreach to appeasement just two months ago before the Israeli Parliament. Some national security hawks have been sharply critical of the latest moves toward Iran and North Korea. “The metaphor to look at is intellectual collapse,” said John R. Bolton, the Bush administration’s former ambassador to the United Nations. “It’s not even a carefully staged retreat. Instead, it’s just a sign to the Iranians that toward the end of the administration, they’re desperate to sign deals.” European officials say they have privately been urging the administration for several years now to engage Iran on the nuclear issue. But some European diplomats questioned the timing of the decision to send Mr. Burns to the Geneva meeting. They said they had little hope that Iranian officials — known for their ability to draw out negotiations for as long as they can — would give the departing Bush administration the concession it was seeking and suspend uranium enrichment. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity under normal diplomatic rules. The furthest Iran will go this year, the diplomats said, is likely to be a “freeze for freeze” proposal, in which it would agree not to enrich uranium beyond current levels, in return for a freeze on sanctions. But the United States has said repeatedly that it will not accept such a proposal and seeks complete suspension of uranium enrichment. For the Bush administration to accept the freeze-for-freeze proposal that is currently being floated, European and American diplomats said, would require yet another major concession.

North Korea agreed to give international aid workers unprecedented access to its hunger-stricken territory.

SEOUL, South Korea — A United States freighter began unloading tons of American wheat in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, on Monday, as the government agreed to give international aid workers unprecedented access to its isolated, hunger-stricken territory, theUnited NationsWorld Food Programsaid. The shipment is the first installment of 500,000 tons in promised American aid to be distributed by the World Food Program and American groups like Mercy Corps. The aid, and the North Korean agreement to invite 50 more food program experts and a consortium of American relief agencies, followed recent progress in efforts to end the North’s nuclear weapons program. “To some degree, this agreement is part of a greater openness byNorth Korea, and that certainly is demonstrated in this agreement,” said Paul Risley, a Bangkok-based spokesman for the food program, which, with 10 foreign staff members in North Korea, is the largest international aid group there. The wheat shipment arrived just days after North Korea delivered a long-delayed nuclear declaration on Thursday. In exchange, Washington said it would lift some economic sanctions and remove the country from a State Department list of state sponsors of terrorism. The North then blew up the cooling tower at its nuclear complex at Yongbyon, the most visible symbol of its weapons program. After sailing for several weeks from the West Coast of the United States, the American-flagged motor ship Baltimore arrived in Nampo, the North’s main port, on Sunday evening. On Monday, it began unloading half of its cargo of 37,000 tons of wheat, Mr. Risley said. The ship will discharge the other half of its cargo at Hungnam and Chongjin, ports on the North’s eastern coast. North Korea agreed on Friday to allow the food program to use the largest number of international workers it has been allowed since it began operations there in 1996, during a famine that eventually killed an estimated two million people. For years, the World Food Program has asked North Korea for more access, believing that far more than the 1.2 million people currently being fed by the agency were in dire need. But North Korea has guarded its people from contact with outside aid workers. However, the North seems headed toward a major food crisis. Two consecutive years of bad harvests and rising grain prices are making it harder for the impoverished North to import food, and  assistance from South Korea and China, traditionally its most generous aid providers, is dwindling. Aid groups have issued increasingly dire warnings. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization said the country faced a  grain shortfall of more than 1.5 million tons, the largest since 2001. Domestic prices for rice, wheat, corn and potatoes have doubled or tripled in recent months, the World Food Program said. Until now, the program has had access to only 50 of  North Korea’s 200 counties. Under the new agreement, it will have access to 128 counties, including the traditionally deprived northeast region.

Two of the world’s most repressive nations, Myanmar and North Korea, restored diplomatic relations after more than two decades of estrangement. The agreement was signed without fanfare during a three-day visit to Myanmar, formerly Burma, by Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Yong-il of North Korea. Myanmar’s deputy foreign minister, Kyaw Thu, said it would be up to the North Koreans to decide whether to open a diplomatic mission in the remote new capital, Naypyidaw, 200 miles north of Yangon, the largest city and former capital. Relations between the nations have been quietly warming over recent years as both sought allies under pressure from the West.

Correction Appended SEOUL, South Korea, April 11 —North Koreasaid it would begin shutting its main nuclear reactor within a day of retrieving about $25 million that had been frozen in aMacaobank because of American sanctions, Gov.Bill Richardsonof New Mexico said here on Wednesday. North Korea also offered to admit United Nations nuclear inspectors for the first time in more than four years,  Mr. Richardson said  after an official visit to North Korea and a meeting with senior officials there. Fulfilling those offers would resolve North Korea’s long dispute with theUnited States Treasury. The disagreement has stalled multinational efforts to restart talks on ending North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. In Macao, the financial authorities announced Wednesday that the holders of accounts at the bank, Banco Delta Asia, containing $25 million in deposits tied to North Korea were now free to withdraw or transfer the money unconditionally. “The North Koreans made it clear that they felt that the Treasury Department had fulfilled its obligations,” Mr. Richardson said Wednesday at a news conference in Seoul. “I’m optimistic about North Korea’s willingness to return to the six-party talks and shut down the Yongbyon reactor.” The inspectors from the United Nations’ nuclear monitoring arm, theInternational Atomic Energy Agency, could be invited back to North Korea this weekend, Mr. Richardson said. The last step the North Koreans were awaiting was an official notification from the Macao bank that the money was available, he said. That notification may be issued by Thursday morning. Mr. Richardson, a Democrat running for his party’s nomination for president in 2008, led a delegation to North Korea that included Victor D. Cha, President  Bush’s main policy adviser on North Korea, and Anthony J. Principi, a former secretary of veterans affairs. The delegation’s official mission was to recover remains of American servicemen killed in the Korean War, 1950-1953. Earlier on Wednesday, the group crossed the heavily guarded border between North and South Korea, completing a four-day trip to North Korea, and bringing what American officials said they believed were the remains of six American soldiers. While they were in North Korea, the delegation members also pressed North Korean officials to restart the stalled nuclear disarmament process. They met with the main nuclear negotiator for North Korea, Kim Kye-gwan, and other senior leaders.

WASHINGTON, April 6 — The United States said Friday that it had found a way to return frozen money toNorth Korea, leaving the North only a week to meet the deadline for disabling its main nuclear facility. The announcement seemed to remove the major impediment to North Korea’s cooperation under an agreement that calls for the North to shut down its main nuclear facility. The Bush administration said the solution applied to legal and technical problems that prevented the return of $25 million frozen during the investigation of a Macao bank. A delegation of senior Treasury Department officials left Beijing on Friday after 13 days of talks over how to return money — including what the United States said were proceeds from the sale of illicit weapons and other illegal activities — held in accounts at a tiny Macao bank known as Banco Delta Asia. Among the accounts, American and intelligence officials said, were some that President Kim Jong-il and other leaders used to buy the loyalty of the North Korean elite. When United States officials announced a deal in mid-February under which North Korea agreed to freeze, and ultimately dismantle, its main nuclear complex, they said they expected that the illicitly gained money would still be withheld by the authorities in Macao. But on Friday, the State Department said the United States expected that all the money would be released, a move that a senior State Department official said was “always considered an option.” North Korea had demanded the return of that money as a prerequisite for moving forward with the freeze-and-dismantlement deal. President Bush has frequently described the seizure of the money as a tactic that succeeded in getting the attention of North Korea’s leaders. But his decision to return that money has been harshly criticized by hawks inside and outside the administration. One of Mr. Bush’s top nuclear proliferation aides, Robert Joseph, left the administration after strenuously arguing that the deal would perpetuate the rule of a government that holds political prisoners in gulags and trades in drugs and counterfeits American currency, using the profits to build its nuclear arsenal. The State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, said Friday that a “technical pathway” had been found to return the funds, transferring them to a new account that North Korea has agreed to use for “humanitarian” purposes. “We support the release of all the funds,” he said. “It is now a matter of technical implementation,” which he said was up to the authorities in Macao and China. If the banking issues are truly resolved, attention will be refocused on the core question raised by the deal: whether North Korea is willing to meet its first deadline, next Saturday, to shut and disable its five-megawatt nuclear reactor at Yongbyon and its reprocessing facility that turns its nuclear fuel into weapons-grade plutonium. It was plutonium produced at Yongbyon, intelligence experts say, that fueled the crude nuclear weapon that the North tested Oct. 9, making it the world’s ninth nation known to possess nuclear weapons. Nothing in the deal that was signed in February set a schedule for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons stockpile, which American intelligence analysts and outside experts estimate at a half-dozen to a dozen weapons, or the fuel to make them. That is one reason that conservatives once closely allied with Mr. Bush have gone public with searing criticisms of the agreement. Administration officials have insisted publicly that the 60-day deadline for freezing nuclear operations remain in place. But they have hinted that they may view the deadline as flexible, because the process of unfreezing the money in Macao took so much longer than expected. Stopping activity at Yongbyon would not be difficult; the reactor there has been shut down before, sometimes for maintenance. But no one has yet defined what it means to “disable” it, and no schedule has been set for actually dismantling it. The next steps after a shutdown would be harder. The chief American negotiator, Christopher R. Hill, who is returning to Asia next Saturday, would have to negotiate to get North Korea to give up its existing stockpiles and to explain what happened to equipment it bought to enrich uranium, another pathway to a bomb.

There are tentative signs of a possible breakthrough in a diplomatic process that seemed shattered four months ago when North Korea tested a nuclear device.

BEIJING, Feb. 7 — Negotiators on Thursday will resume the long-stalled talks aimed at North Korean nuclear disarmament amid tentative signs of a possible breakthrough in a diplomatic process that seemed shattered four months ago whenNorth Koreatested a nuclear device. Christopher R. Hill, the chief American envoy, arrived in Beijing on Wednesday and held separate meetings with Chinese and Russian diplomats. Mr. Hill has been shuttling around the world, meeting with envoys from North Korea and other countries, in an effort to restart and advance the talks that North Korea abandoned more than a year ago. “We all share ambitions for this round,” Mr. Hill told reporters as he arrived at his hotel on Wednesday evening. “We want to make a good start, a good step forward.” Mr. Hill is essentially trying to return the process to September 2005, when North Korea agreed in a broad draft accord to end its nuclear  arms program in return for security, economic and energy benefits. Even then, analysts said the differences between the United States and North Korea made a final agreement far from certain. Subsequent talks on carrying out the provisions broke down, and North Korea then defied international warnings by testing a nuclear  device last October. In a brief appearance earlier Wednesday at the Beijing airport, Mr. Hill was careful not to set expectations too high for this week. “I want to emphasize that the real success is when we complete the September ’05 agreement,” he said. “Not just when we start the ’05 agreement, but when we finish it. So we’re not going to finish that this week.” “We’ll just maybe take a good first step,” he said. The talks — which involve China, Russia, Japan, South Korea, the United States and North Korea — began more than three years ago and have brought scarce tangible progress after various  rounds in Beijing. Formal talks will resume Thursday afternoon in a government guesthouse in Beijing and are likely to continue into the weekend. Recently, North Korea has seemed to signal more of a willingness to bargain and to specify its demands. Last weekend, two American envoys returning from Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, said the nation was prepared to disable its main nuclear reactor in Yongbyon in exchange for an energy package of electricity and oil from its neighbors. North Korea also told the envoys that it wanted the United States to lift financial sanctions and remove it from a list of states that sponsored terrorism. The two envoys, Joel S. Wit, a Clinton administration official involved in North Korea issues, and David Albright, a nuclear specialist, first described the North Korean position to the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun, while passing through the Beijing airport last Saturday. Mr. Hill,  assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, has spent much of 2007 traveling to build a consensus on a deal. Last month, he and the top North Korean envoy, Kim Kye-gwan,  met in Berlin, the first such meetings between the United States and North Korea outside Beijing. Mr. Hill described those talks as “substantive” and has expressed guarded optimism throughout his travels. A potential sticking point for North Korea is how much ground the United States will give on financial sanctions. In  2005, the United States accused Banco Delta Asia in  Macao,  a Chinese territory, of laundering counterfeit dollars that it said North Korea was using to finance drug trafficking and other illegal activities. The United States froze $24 million in North Korean assets, largely shutting North Korea out of the international financial system. North Korea has demanded the release of the $24 million. Last week, a United States Treasury official met  with North Korean diplomats on the issue. Brian Bridges, a professor of politics at Lingnan University in Hong Kong, said no breakthrough was apparent but that  there had been speculation that the United States might agree to declare part of the frozen Banco Delta Asia  money “clean” in a compromise.   Mr. Bridges predicted that negotiations this week, at best, might  form working groups to discuss particular issues like denuclearization and the sanctions. But he said any larger, significant progress was unlikely. “I’m not too optimistic,” he said. “I don’t think there is going to be a major breakthrough.”

It took 13 days for American and Chinese leaders to have a conversation about North Korea’s latest action.
==::==
2010-12-07T00:00:00Z
==::==
BEIJING —President Obamaand PresidentHu JintaoofChinatalked by telephone on Monday aboutNorth Korea, culminating 13 days of effort by the White House to persuade China’s leaders to discuss a crisis that many experts fear could escalate into military action. Administration officials say they have no evidence Mr. Hu was ducking the call, which the Chinese knew would urge them to crack down on their unruly ally, a step Beijing clearly is highly reluctant to take amid a leadership succession in North Korea. White House officials insisted that the long delay was simply the result of scheduling problems. But  in Beijing, both Chinese and American officials and analysts have another explanation: the long silence epitomizes the speed with which relations between Washington and Beijing have plunged into a freeze. This year has witnessed the longest period of tension between the two capitals in a decade. And if anything, both sides appear to be hardening their positions. “The issues that used to be on the positive side of the ledger are increasingly on the negative side of the ledger, starting with North Korea,” Bonnie Glaser, a China scholar at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in an interview last week. “I don’t think this is easily repairable, and I think we’re going to have a fairly cold relationship over the next two years, and potentially longer.” Mr. Obama came into office seeking just the opposite: a new rapprochement with a rising power whose deep economic ties with the United States all but demand closer diplomatic ones. But the days when the White House spoke of a “G-2” that would manage the world economy and more, a phrase that preceded the first meeting between Mr. Obama and Mr. Hu in the depths of the financial crisis in early 2009, are long over. Instead, he faces a problem very similar to the one Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton described in March 2009 during a lunch with Kevin Rudd, a China expert who was then Australia’s prime minister, according to a cable recounting their conversation that was in a newly released trove of WikiLeaks documents. Mrs. Clinton was said to have asked Mr. Rudd, “How do you deal toughly with your banker?”‘ The latest bad sign is that cooperation on managing North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, which began with considerable promise in 2009, appears to have disintegrated. On Monday, Mrs. Clinton was scheduled to convene an emergency meeting in Washington with her Japanese and South Korean counterparts about both the North’s shelling of a South Korean island last month, and its recent disclosure of a new nuclear facility that potentially expands its nuclear arsenal. China, the only nation with real sway over the North Korean leadership, will not be there. To the contrary, China’s strategy on North Korea is at odds with that of Washington and its allies. In Monday’s telephone call with Mr. Hu, the White House said, Mr. Obama said North Korea’s new enrichment facility flouted commitments it made during the six-party talks on curbing its nuclear program, and urged China’s help in sending “a clear message to North Korea that its provocations are unacceptable.” One former Chinese official with close ties to the government dismissed the American approach last week as characteristically legalistic. The former official, who would not be named because he is not authorized to speak on the topic, said China’s strategy is to reassure the Koreans about their security, not lecture them about diplomatic obligations. Indeed, China’s strongest public reaction to last month’s shelling of South Korea has not been to condemn the North, but to criticize Washington’s response — joint war games with South Korea that put the American carrier George Washington and its strike force in the Yellow Sea, off China’s borders. After Mr. Obama’s national security team met last Tuesday night, administration officials began saying that the United States would conduct more military exercises near North Korea and China should the North engage in further provocations. It was an unmistakable message to Beijing that failing to rein in its ally would only increase an American military presence that China loathes. But the lack of cooperation on North Korea only hints at the deterioration in the U.S.-China relationship. In another leaked diplomatic cable, the American ambassador to Beijing, Jon Huntsman, wrote last January that the United States faced “a challenging year ahead” in relations with China, adding: “We need to find ways to keep the relationship positive.” Instead, two successive meetings between Mr. Obama and China’s top leaders in recent months have yielded little change in China’s management of its currency. A China-based attack on Google computers early this year riveted attention on Beijing’s potential for cyberwar, and provoked nasty exchanges on the two nations’ concepts of free speech. In public and private, China bitterly accuses the United States of engineering the award in October of the Nobel Peace Prize to a Chinese dissident, Liu Xiaobo, in an effort to undermine its government. And those are but lowlights of a year in which Chinese officials have railed loudly and publicly against what they consider to be American efforts to smother their rightful emergence on the global stage. No outsiders can peer inside the black box where Chinese policies are made. But rumors abound that Beijing’s leadership decided in the last year that the United States’ faltering after the 2008 economic crisis had handed Beijing an opportunity to seize the global initiative. “They feel the ball is at their feet,” one well-connected Chinese political analyst, who did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue, said in an interview. “The economic crisis was the main thing. China could really say ‘no’ to the U.S.” By comparison, he said, Washington has little leverage over Chinese policies. There are doubtless other factors at work. China’s domestic Internet is being bombarded by ardent nationalists whose sheer volume of comments may sway official policy. The government faces a difficult succession in 2012 — one in which the safe route for every contender for power is to hew to solidly pro-China ideology. Nor are Americans ready to accept a world in which their top-dog status is at considerable risk. “A lot of America hasn’t caught up with the fact that China now can say no more often,” said Russell Leigh Moses, a Beijing-based analyst of China’s leadership. “When you’ve got a 6-year-old and he throws a whiffle ball against a window and it bounces off harmlessly, nobody thinks anything of it. “But when he’s older, and he throws a hardball, you’ve got a broken window.” The difficulty in connecting Mr. Obama and Mr. Hu is reminiscent of the last moment of deep tension between the two countries in early 2001, after a Chinese fighter collided with an American spy plane trailing just off the Chinese coast, sending the American plane and its crew into an emergency landing on Chinese soil. President George W. Bush spent more than a week trying to get his counterpart, Jiang Zemin, on the phone. The Chinese — clearly trying to sort out how to handle the crisis — declined to take the call until their internal debate was over. The American crew was eventually returned; the Chinese sent the plane back in a box, after disassembling and inspecting every component. Several current and former American officials, as well as foreign diplomats, say they suspect that this time, the Chinese leadership is still debating how to balance its interest in propping up North Korea with their interest in preventing more incidents or another nuclear test, which would be North Korea’s third. But the outside world may never know, particularly after candid discussions about North Korea between American and Chinese officials have been revealed in WikiLeaks documents. “The Chinese don’t like talking about this stuff,” one senior American official put it two weeks ago, after the North revealed its new nuclear site. “And they certainly don’t like talking about it over the phone.”

The strategy makes just about every nonnuclear state immune from any threat of nuclear retaliation by the United States, but it carves out an exception for Iran and North Korea.
==::==
2010-04-07T00:00:00Z
==::==
WASHINGTON — At the heart ofPresident Obama’s new nuclear strategy lies a central gamble: that an aging, oversize, increasingly outmoded nuclear arsenal can be turned to the new purpose of adding leverage to the faltering effort to forceIranandNorth Koreato rethink the value of their nuclear programs. The 50-page “Nuclear Posture Review” released on Tuesday acknowledged outright that “the massive nuclear arsenal we inherited from the cold-war era” is “poorly suited to address the challenges posed by suicidal terrorist and unfriendly regimes seekingnuclear weapons.” Nonetheless, the new strategy aims to use the arsenal to do just that, despite considerable skepticism that any new doctrine or set of White House announcements is likely to change the calculus for North Korea or Iran. Mr. Obama’s new strategy makes just about every nonnuclear state immune from any threat of nuclear retaliation by the United States. But it carves out an exception for Iran and North Korea,  labeled “outliers” rather than the Bush-era moniker of “rogue states.” The wording was chosen, Mr. Obama’s senior advisers said, to suggest they have a path back to international respectability — and to de-targeting by the United States. Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates made the choice explicit. “There is a message for Iran and North Korea here,” he told reporters on Tuesday. Nonnuclear states that abide by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty would not be threatened with nuclear retaliation by the United States — even if they conducted conventional, biological or cyber attacks. But, he added, “if you’re not going to play by the rules, if you’re going to be a proliferator, then all options are on the table in terms of how we deal with you.” A number of analysts argued that by publicly painting a target on Iran and North Korea the administration could, perhaps unwittingly, bolster hard-liners in those countries, who have made the case that nuclear weapons are the only way to ensure their safety against American plotting. The opposite critique  came from two senior Republican Party national security experts — Senators John McCain and Jon Kyl, both of Arizona — who contended that the pressure was not direct enough. “We believe that preventing nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation should begin by directly confronting the two leading proliferators and supporters of terrorism, Iran and North Korea,” they wrote. “The Obama administration’s policies, thus far, have failed to do that, and this failure has sent exactly the wrong message to other would be proliferators and supporters of terrorism.” To Mr. Obama and his aides, the “outlier” approach is all part of a broader strategy of adding to the pressure on both countries. Over the past year, they have aided the interception of North Korea’s shipping. They have sought to develop new  sanctions against the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps  and to undermine its nuclear program with a program of covert action. Robert S. Litwak,  vice president for programs at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said that Mr. Obama had expanded an effort begun by President George W. Bush  to globalize the effort to contain the nuclear aims of both nations. Under Mr. Obama’s strategy, he said, “It is the United States and the world versus Iran, not just the United States versus Iran.” (Mr. Bush’s former aides note that during their time in office, they pushed through four United Nations Security Council resolutions against Tehran, though to little effect.) The new strategy takes that effort one step further, warning both countries that the United States could still use its nuclear arsenal to counter any effort to sell or transfer the country’s nuclear technology to terrorists. “The United States will continue to hold accountable any state, terrorist group or other nonstate actor that supports or enables terrorist efforts to obtain or use weapons of mass destruction,” Mr. Gates said on Tuesday, “whether by facilitating, financing, or providing expertise or safe haven for such efforts.” The problem Mr. Obama faces is that the Bush administration used virtually identical language to warn North Korea soon after it conducted a nuclear test in 2006. The next year, however, North Korea was caught helping Syria build a nuclear reactor.  Israel destroyed the site in a nighttime raid in  2007. But  North Korea paid little price for what is widely regarded as its most audacious attempt at nuclear proliferation. Mr. Obama, asked on Monday whether that episode harmed American credibility, said, “I don’t think countries around the world are interested in testing our credibility when it comes to these issues. “The message we’re sending here,” he said, was that countries that “actively pursue a proliferation agenda” would not be immune from any form of American retaliation, including nuclear. The reality is more complex. If a backpack nuclear bomb went off in Times Square or on the Mall in Washington, the Pentagon and the Department of Energy would race to find the nuclear DNA of the weapon — so that the country that was the source of the material could be punished. But the science of “nuclear attribution” is still sketchy. And without certain attribution, it is hard to seriously threaten retaliation. The nuclear review also details a larger set of tools to shape the behavior of Iran and North Korea. By reducing the size of America’s own stockpiles, and assuring nonnuclear states inside the nonproliferation treaty that they are exempt from any nuclear attack, the administration hopes to bolster its credentials to close huge loopholes in the treaty that both North Korea and Iran have artfully exploited. “We think we now have credibility Bush never did,” one of Mr. Obama’s aides said, “to tighten the noose. But it will be a very, very slow process.”

The Security Council must commit to a resolution intended to strengthen the fraying rules that are supposed to stop the spread of nuclear weapons.

With President Obama chairing the session and 13 other leaders around the table, the United Nations Security Councilunanimously adopted a resolutionon Thursday intended to strengthen the fraying rules that are supposed to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. It was a good-news moment. But also a reminder of the past limits of the Security Council’s will and effectiveness. In defiance of its orders, North Korea has tested two weapons and Iran continues to churn out nuclear fuel. The resolution commits all member states to a long list of worthy goals, including ratification of the test ban treaty and adoption of stronger national controls on nuclear exports. But some of the countries around the table will have to do a lot more to prove that they mean it. The resolution commits all United Nations members to enforcing current sanctions on Iran and North Korea. But those measures were seriously watered down — for political and economic reasons — by Russia and China. Russia’s president, Dmitri Medvedev, now says that he might be open to tougher measures on Iran if negotiations fail to bear fruit. China continues to oppose tougher penalties that may be the only chance for constraining Tehran’s nuclear ambitions. The resolution set a practical target by urging states to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials within four years.The Security Councilbroke some new ground by warning that any member of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty that secretly develops a weapon and then withdraws from the treaty — North Korea’s route — will still be held responsible for its violations. We wish the Security Council had called for states to end rather than minimize the use of highly enriched uranium — a potential bomb fuel — in medical research. And the resolution only encourages, rather than requires, governments to consider whether a state seeking to buy nuclear technology has accepted intrusive United Nations monitoring. Fortunately, there will be opportunities to fine-tune these goals. A conference on nuclear security is scheduled for next April, and two weeks later the United Nations will review the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which has been weakened by Bush-era neglect and Iranian and North Korean violations. We applaud Mr. Obama for highlighting the nuclear dangers out there and pressing the world to address them. He still has a tough sell at home. He is far from the votes he needs for the Senate to ratify the test ban treaty. Some 150 countries have ratified it. But the treaty cannot take effect until other major holdouts — including China, India, Pakistan and Israel — also ratify it. Washington’s failure gives them an all-too-convenient excuse. Mr. Obama will have to work hard to rally broader support.

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton stiffened the American line against Iran.

PHUKET, Thailand — Stiffening the American line againstIran, Secretary of StateHillary Rodham Clintonwarned  Wednesday that the United States would consider extending a “defense umbrella” over the Middle East if the country continued to defy international demands that it halt work that could lead tonuclear weapons. While such a defensive shield has long been assumed, administration officials in Washington acknowledged Wednesday that no senior official had ever publicly discussed it. Some of the officials said the timing of Mrs. Clinton’s remarks reflected a growing sense that President Obama needed to signal to Tehran that its nuclear ambitions could be countered militarily, as well as diplomatically. It also signified increasing concern in Washington that other Middle East states — notably Saudi Arabia and Egypt — might be tempted to pursue their own nuclear programs for fear  Iran was growing closer to realizing its  presumed  nuclear ambitions. Mrs. Clinton later clarified her comments on Iran, delivered in advance of a regional meeting here, saying her warning that the United States might create such an umbrella  did not represent any backing away from the Obama administration’s position that it must prevent Tehran from obtaining a bomb capability. But her words suggested that the administration was developing a strategy should all efforts at negotiation fail. Her statement also came as Iran’s internal divisions and crackdown on post-election protests have complicated Mr. Obama’s pledge to “engage” Iran directly. Iranian officials have hinted that they will present new proposals on the nuclear program, and American officials have said their offers to negotiate stand. Speaking  during a televised town hall meeting in Bangkok, Mrs. Clinton said, “We want Iran to calculate what I think is a fair assessment, that if the U.S. extends a defense umbrella over the region, if we do even more to support the military capacity of those in the gulf, it’s unlikely that Iran will be any stronger or safer, because they won’t be able to intimidate and dominate, as they apparently believe they can, once they have a nuclear weapon.” Asked about Mrs. Clinton’s comments,Sir Nigel Sheinwald, the British ambassador to the United States, said, “I don’t think it should be read as an acceptance of an Iranian nuclear weapon” but rather as a statement intended  to “reassure our partners in the gulf.” A senior White House official said he believed that Mrs. Clinton was speaking for herself and that she was, as she insisted, restating existing policy. Mrs. Clinton’s invocation of a defense umbrella is reminiscent of the so-called nuclear umbrella that Washington extends to its Asian allies: implicitly, the promise of an American reprisal if they are attacked by nuclear weapons. But she did not use the term nuclear, and a senior State Department official cautioned that her remarks should not be interpreted to mean that. After meeting the foreign ministers of China, Russia, Japan and South Korea, Mrs. Clinton also said that the United States would not offer new incentives toNorth Koreato return to negotiations. She said all of the other nations that had engaged in talks with North Korea in the past five years were united in demanding that North Korea undertake a “complete and irreversible denuclearization” before receiving any economic or political incentives from them. She did not detail the steps that would be part of such a process, though she confirmed that they could include the disabling of the Yongbyon nuclear complex. Last year, North Korea began to dismantle that complex, where it runs a nuclear reactor and reprocess fuel rods to recover plutonium, butit vowed in June to restart production there. The United States has had an uncharacteristically visible presence at this gathering of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean. It signed a friendship treaty with Asean’s 10 members and called on one country,Myanmar, to release the imprisoned pro-democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Israel’s minister of intelligence and atomic energy, Dan Meridor, told Israeli Army radio: “I was not thrilled to hear the American statement from yesterday that they will protect their allies with a nuclear umbrella, as if they have already come to terms with a nuclear Iran. I think that’s a mistake.” Mrs. Clinton said she was trying to make even starker the choice Iran faced if it did not agree to abandon its program. The administration has talked about bolstering the military capacity of Iran’s neighbors in the Persian Gulf so they could better meet the threat of a heavily armed Iran. It has also defended the proposed missile defense system in Eastern Europe as a potential shield against Iran. “It faces the prospect, if it pursues nuclear weapons, of sparking an arms race in the region,” Mrs. Clinton said. “That should affect the calculation of what Iran intends to do, and what it believes is in its national security interest.” On North Korea, Mrs. Clinton tried to project a united front, saying that China, Russia, Japan and South Korea had pledged to carry out theUnited Nations sanctions adopted in Juneagainst the North after its recent nuclear and missile tests. Mrs. Clinton also reiterated concerns that North Korea might be transferring nuclear technology to Myanmar, which American officials refer to by its former name, Burma. She is to deliver a statement on North Korea on Thursday. In an excerpt provided to reporters, the tone remained unyielding, but the United States pledged to give North Korea “significant economic and energy assistance” if it undertook a verifiable denuclearization. At the ministers meeting, Mrs. Clinton demanded that Myanmar release Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, who could face years in prison  on charges that she violated her house arrest. “It’s so critical that she be released from this persecution that she has been under,” she said later at a news conference. “If she were released, that would open up opportunities, at least for my country, to expand our relationship with Burma, including investments in Burma.” American officials met with diplomatic officials from Myanmar later to reiterate Mrs. Clinton’s demand.

The uproar over the results of Iran’s presidential election is a vivid demonstration of the extent the West is prepared to go to silence anyone who does not share the Western  narrative of history. No matter how repugnant President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s stance on the Holocaust may be, no matter how often Iran’s clerical regime lies to cover up its dismal economic record, the West must stop meddling in Iran’s internal affairs, stop the character assassination of its elected leader and stop shedding crocodile tears over the demise of democracy in Iran. The West no longer has the moral superiority to lecture other nations on whom they should elect. It must come to terms with the fact that democracy can yield unpleasant surprises. Munjed Farid Al Qutob,  London How can the West trust the government of Iran regarding its production of nuclear materials  when the regime can’t even hold a fair election? Steven M. Clayton,      Ocean, New Jersey The world seems to be suffering from an overdose of Western wishful thinking. Whether it’s millions of  redirected votes in Iran or one hanging chad in Florida, corruption is here to stay. Established powers in democracies serve only one function: to get themselves re-elected. David Wood,  Chikushino City, Japan China and North Korea Andrei Lankov  says that Beijing may dislike a nuclear North Korea but it  fears more the collapse of the regime in the North (“Why China props up Pyongyang,” Views, June 12). Mr. Lankov adds that  China will not press hard on North Korea   because it fears that a an end to the North Korean regime  would result in millions of refugees flooding China as well insecure stocks of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. But there’s another scenario that Mr. Lankov doesn’t mention.  What if the current North Korean regime were forced out and replaced with a Beijing-friendly regime? The Tibet model, if you will.  Northern Asia would be stable again and everyone would breathe a sigh of relief. Christa Klein,  Munich

The White House is set to make public a video showing North Koreans working at a suspected Syrian nuclear reactor.
==::==
2008-04-24T00:00:00Z
==::==
WASHINGTON — After seven months of near-total secrecy, the White House is preparing to make public on Thursday  video evidence of  North Koreans working at a suspected Syrian nuclear reactor just before it was destroyed in an Israeli airstrike last September. Until now, the administration has refused to discuss the video or the attack, other than in a highly classified briefing for a few allies and crucial members of Congress. But senior officials in Israel and the United States have said the target was a nascent nuclear reactor  that had been under construction for years. Israeli and American analysts had concluded that it was loosely modeled on the reactorNorth Koreaused to obtain the fuel for its small nuclear weapons arsenal. Israeli jets destroyed the site on Sept. 6, and the Syrians, after issuing some protests, bulldozed the area and constructed a building on the exact footprint of the old one. They have refused to allow international nuclear inspectors to visit the location. The timing of the administration’s decision to declassify information about the Syrian project has raised widespread suspicions, especially in the State Department, that Vice PresidentDick Cheneyand other administration hawks were hoping that releasing the information might undermine a potential deal with North Korea that would take it off an American list of state sponsors of terrorism. “Making public the pictures is likely to inflame the North Koreans,” said one senior administration official who would not speak on the record because the White House and the State Department have declared there would be no public comment until the evidence is released. “And that’s just what opponents of this whole arrangement want, because they think the North Koreans will stalk off.” But another senior official said it was possible that the revelations would force the North Koreans to describe their actions inSyriamore fully when they issued a long delayed declaration of their nuclear activities. That proposed deal, negotiated by Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs and the primary interlocutor with North Korea, has become the latest battleground in a seven-year struggle within the Bush administration over North Korea policy. That policy has veered from efforts to squeeze North Korea in hopes that the government ofKim Jong-ilwill collapse, to negotiating with the country alongside Russia, China, South Korea and Japan, each of which has pursued a somewhat different approach toward the North. Mr. Hill was put in charge of the talks more than three years ago in the hope of finding a new way to deal with the North Koreans. But support for him has wavered, and President Bush has repeatedly warned aides not to agree to anything that “makes me look weak,” according to former officials who sat in on meetings with him on North Korea. Mr. Cheney’s office and other conservatives have argued that Mr. Hill’s proposed deal would amount to a huge concession. In return for a minimal declaration from North Korea — an accounting of how much plutonium it has produced — it would be removed from the terrorism list and would no longer be subject to economic sanctions under the Trading With the Enemy Act. North Korea has refused to say what, exactly, it provided to the Syrians, or what happened to an effort to start a second pathway to building arms, using uranium. The deal would allow the North to continue to fudge on those matters, leaving unexplained the question of why it appeared to be buying uranium enrichment equipment from Pakistan. That equipment, many experts believe, was intended to help North Korea build a second path to a bomb, in case it was forced to give up its plutonium program. In a presentation on Thursday to crucial members of Congress, and then in a presentation to reporters, American intelligence officials are expected to show images  from a video, believed to have been obtained through Israeli intelligence services. The video, which Mr. Hill has shown to senior South Korean officials, shows Korean faces among the workers at the Syrian plant. Other pictures, officials say, show what appears to be the construction of a reactor vessel inside the building that Israel later destroyed. It is unclear what the administration is willing to release. Syria’s ambassador to the United States, Imad Moustapha, did not answer messages left for him on Wednesday. For weeks after the Israeli attack in September, neither Israeli nor American officials would talk about the attack, Israel’s first on a nuclear site since the 1981 attack on the Osirak nuclear reactor in Iraq. When The New York Times published a lengthy account of the Syria attack on Oct. 14, revealing that Israeli and American analysts judged that the target was a partly constructed nuclear reactor, Mr. Bush and the White House refused to answer questions about it. Later, officials said they feared that the Syrians would retaliate against Israel if they felt publicly humiliated. It is not clear what has changed, apart from the politics of the moment. Mr. Hill’s boss, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, has not voiced strong support for Mr. Hill’s effort to coax the North Koreans along, granting them rewards for steps along the way to compliance with a deal that calls, ultimately, for the country to give up its weapons. Ms. Rice has been a strong critic of the 1994 agreement between North Korea and the Clinton administration, complaining that it was “front loaded” with rewards for the North. That is exactly what critics say she and Mr. Hill have done in the most recent agreement. But Mr. Hill has argued in private that the Syrian episode and the uranium enrichment are side shows, and that the critical issue is stopping North Korea from producing more plutonium and giving up what it has. But his State Department colleagues say that he has been told not to defend the deal, or even explain it. “He’s feeling pretty abandoned by Rice and Bush,” one of his colleagues said Wednesday. Mr. Hill did not respond to messages.

Talks in Hanoi between Japan and North Korea on normalizing ties ended after just 45 minutes yesterday, with their top envoys blaming each other for a lack of agreement on issues. No further discussion is planned in Hanoi, Japan’s envoy, Koichi Haraguchi, said. No date was announced for future talks. The first day of talks, on Wednesday, also ended abruptly when North Korean negotiators reacted angrily to Japan’s insistence that they must resolve the issue of the abduction of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 80s before improving the countries’ ties. The North Korean envoy, Song Il-ho, said he wanted Japan to take a first step and lift sanctions.

North Korea is becoming more belligerent by the week, but China is still playing cynical diplomacy-as-usual.
==::==
2010-12-03T00:00:00Z

What is China thinking? Its client and neighbor North Korea is becoming more belligerent by the week, and Beijing is still playing cynical diplomacy-as-usual. To quickly recap: Last week, the North Korean military shelled a South Korean island  — killing two South Korean marines and two civilians.  Two weeks before that, the North flaunted a new nuclear fuel plant that could significantly increase its arsenal. Earlier this year, the North torpedoed a South Korean warship, killing 46 sailors. The South has shown remarkable forbearance, but the risk of a wider confrontation grows with each incident. China is the North’s main supplier of food and fuel, but it is refusing to rein in Pyongyang. Beijing said nothing after the North unveiled its uranium plant. After the shelling, it refused to condemn the North. Only after the Pentagon sent warships to join South Korea in military exercises did China bestir itself, calling for a  meeting of the six-party players — the two Koreas, China, Russia, Japan and the United States — and exchanging diplomatic visits with Pyongyang. Any warnings that China might be sending in private (and there is no guarantee of even that) were immediately undercut by more of its public enabling. It saved its toughest words for the United States, warning against military activities that might infringe on waters around China. Then China blocked the United Nations Security Council from condemning the North’s dangerous behavior. And its foreign minister vowed that his country intended to remain neutral. On Thursday, a senior Chinese official declared that the China-North Korea friendship has long “withstood the tests of international tempests.” Washington, Seoul and Tokyo were correct to spurn China’s call for a six-party meeting. Negotiations backed by sanctions are the best hope of a peaceful resolution, and at some point they will have to re-engage with the North. But there is no evidence that Pyongyang or Beijing are ready to deal seriously with the North’s aggression or its nuclear ambitions. The Obama administration’s decision to send an aircraft carrier group into the Yellow Sea reinforced support for Seoul and got China’s attention. It was also important that the carrier moved on to Japan after four days — ready to return if needed. We are not sure that the administration has much of a strategy beyond that. When American, South Korean and Japanese officials meet on Monday in Washington, they need to have a serious discussion about what it will take to get North Korea to calm down and into serious negotiations. We suspect that, for now, China is the only one with leverage. It could block deliveries of luxury goods to North Korea’s elite or suspend fuel shipments. That means Monday’s talks in Washington need to be as much about China and how to persuade it that enabling North Korea is a very dangerous game. China has long made clear that it has only two concerns when it comes to the Korean peninsula: stability on its border and limiting the American presence. Before it’s too late, it needs to realize that an erratic, increasingly aggressive neighbor armed with nuclear weapons is anything but a recipe for stability — or for an American military drawdown.

Officials said a return to the negotiating table would be rewarding Pyongyang for provocative behavior.

WASHINGTON — The United States, South Korea and Japan are all balking at China’s request for emergency talks withNorth Koreaover the crisis on the Korean Peninsula, as high-profile military exercises between South Korea and the United States in the Yellow Sea continued on Monday in a show of force. Obama administration officials said that a return to the table with North Korea, as China sought this weekend, would be rewarding the North for provocative behavior over the past week, including its deadly artillery attack on a South Korean island and its disclosure of a uranium enrichment plant. Beijing called for emergency talks with North Korea, the United States, Japan, South Korea and Russia, participants in the six-party nuclear talks, which have been suspended indefinitely. “The United States and a host of others, I don’t think, are not interested in stabilizing the region through a series of P.R. activities,” said Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesman. He said that the talks “without an understanding and agreement from the North Koreans to both end their behavior as they exhibited last week, but also to come to the table with a seriousness of purpose on the denuclearization issue — without that seriousness of purpose, they’re just a P.R. activity.” Rejecting the emergency talks amounts to a pointed rebuke to China. The United States wanted China to signal clearly that North Korea’s aggressive behavior would not be tolerated. Instead, Beijing remained neutral about who was responsible for the recent flare-up, and offered only to provide a venue for all sides to air their differences. Yet turning down China’s offer may also reveal the limited options available to the Obama administration and the South Korean leadership. Aside from a show of military solidarity, the two countries have based their response largely on hopes that China, as the North’s main economic and diplomatic supporter, might punish the reclusive government for its series of provocations. Mr. Gibbs and other administration officials said that the United States also wanted to see North Korea take steps to denuclearize, which most Asia analysts said might be a tall order for the North at a time when its government is undergoing a leadership crisis. South Korea and Japan are also clearly skeptical of whether the consultations, as suggested by the Chinese, are worth a try. President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea and Prime Minister Naoto Kan of Japan on Monday both denounced what they called North Korea’s brutality. President Lee pointedly said nothing about the Chinese proposal; analysts in Seoul described it as disappointingly familiar. A spokesman for the Japanese prime minister said that while Japan is cautiously reviewing China’s offer, talks hinge on whether North Korea changes it behavior. It remains unclear just what the United States would actually accept from North Korea to return to talks. One Obama administration official said that the United States wanted a clear sign that the North “will stop provocative behavior.” “We’re trying to get out of this cycle where they act up and we talk,” the official said. He spoke on grounds of anonymity under diplomatic rules. Emotions continued to run  high on Tuesday in both Seoul and Pyongyang.  In an editorial in the government-run newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, North Korea threatened  to step its uranium enrichment program. North Korean officials last week unveiled a surprisingly sophisticated enrichment plant north of the capital to an American scientist. The editorial said the uranium development “will be pushed harder” to meet North Korea’s energy needs, according to a report by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency. But scientists say the plant with 2,000 centrifuges could be quickly converted to produce highly enriched uranium for bomb fuel and South Korean analysts interpreted the editorial as a not-so-veiled threat. In Seoul, police officials said up to 10,000 protesters gathered in two plazas to demand that their government take a stronger stand against the North. Military veterans, retired police officers and activists carried pickets and banners calling for retaliation against the North during the three-hour protests. “We came to show our commitment to overthrow Kim Jong-il. We have to show it in action,” said Lee Jae-myung. 63, a retired police officer who traveled with about 100 former officers two hours by train to participate in the rally. On the diplomatic front, two North Korean envoys arrived in Beijing for four days of talks. Choe Thae-bok, secretary of the Workers’ Party of North Korea’s Central Committee, and Kim Yong-il, director of the party’s international department. Separately, South Korea’s military appeared to step back from one confrontational stance on Monday , canceling live-fire artillery drills on the island in the Yellow Sea attacked by the North a week ago. While the military exercises continued, the prospect of the South Korean live-fire drills — scheduled for Tuesday but canceled within four hours of the announcement — had been sharpening tensions on a peninsula on tenterhooks after the North’s artillery attack last week on a garrison island that is also home to about 1,350 civilians, mainly fishermen. The attack killed two South Korean marines and two civilians, and wounded 18 people. North Korea blamed the South for provoking the attack by firing at it from the island, Yeonpyeong, which lies in waters disputed by the two sides. The South, which returned fire, insisted it had been firing only test shots and that none were in territory it recognized as the North’s. The United States announced the date of the joint exercises as an immediate response. China — which the United States, South Korea and other countries hoped would act to calm the North — responded by warning the United States not to operate in waters it claims as a sovereign zone. In Washington, the Pentagon cited security concerns and declined to say precisely where in the Yellow Sea the exercises were taking place. But a military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity acknowledged that some of the exercises might be within 200 nautical miles of the Chinese coast. China defines that zone as within its exclusive sovereignty, but the United States and many other nations do not recognize its claim. “We have a large operating area and some of it may be, and some of it may not be” within 200 miles of China’s eastern border, the official said. South Korea naval authorities on Yeonpyeong warned residents by loudspeaker on Monday afternoon that they should move to bomb shelters by 9:30 a.m. Tuesday morning because live-fire drills would take place at 10 a.m. But Monday night, they announced that no firing would take place. A South Korean military official declined to explain the shift, saying only that the exercise “will be conducted at an appropriate time.” At the United Nations, the Obama administration called for tighter enforcement of sanctions against North Korea. The Security Council met on Monday to discuss the crisis, but did not emerge with any new plans for what to do next, further reflecting the mounting frustration in the international community over how to rein in North Korea. Diplomats said that at the moment, the most they could do was to try to make sure countries enforce existing sanctions against North Korea, including an arms embargo and a travel ban against people linked to the country’snuclear weaponsprogram. Susan E. Rice, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters that the United States looked “to China to play a responsible leadership role in working to maintain peace and security in that region.” White House officials said last week that Mr. Obama planned to call President Hu Jintao of China to discuss the crisis in the Korean Peninsula. Mr. Gibbs said Monday afternoon that the call had not happened yet.

Former President Jimmy Carter had been visiting on a humanitarian mission; it was not known whether he met with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il.

SEOUL, South Korea — Former PresidentJimmy Carterwas expected to leaveNorth Koreaon Friday with Aijalon Mahli Gomes, an American who was sentenced to eight years of hard labor for illegally entering the country, the Carter Center said. Mr. Gomes was granted amnesty by the North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, the Carter Center said in an e-mail. “It is expected that Mr. Gomes will be returned to Boston, Mass., early Friday afternoon, to be reunited with his mother and other members of his family,” the statement said. Mr. Carter had been visiting Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, on a private humanitarian mission to win the release of Mr. Gomes, who was sentenced in April to eight years in a North Korean prison and fined $700,000 for entering the country illegally. There has also been speculation that North Korea might try to use Mr. Carter as a conduit to ease tensions with the United States. Mr. Carter hadarrived on Wednesdayat the invitation of the North Korean government, but it was not known whether he met with Mr. Kim, the North Korean leader. South Korean officials said Thursday that a special train believed to be carrying Mr. Kim had enteredChinaaround midnight on Wednesday, setting off speculation over what might have compelled him to travel to his isolated government’s closest ally while Mr. Carter was visiting. After watching Mr. Kim’s movements for the past few days, the South Korean authorities said his train had crossed the border with China, traveling from the North Korean town of Manpo to Jian in China, according to an official at the presidential Blue House in Seoul. Two South Korean intelligence sources who, like the presidential aide, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter, said Mr. Kim might be taking his son with him to introduce him formally to Chinese leaders. South Korean news outlets raised the same possibility. Mr. Kim is grooming hisyoungest son, Kim Jong-un, as successor, according to South Korean officials. North Korea is to convene a congress of its ruling Workers’ Party early next month, where Mr. Kim is expected to rally popular support for his succession plans. If confirmed, this would be Mr. Kim’s sixth trip to China, his impoverished country’s largest trading partner and aid provider. His last trip was in May, when he met President Hu Jintao duringa five-day visit. North Korea and China usually do not confirm a trip by Mr. Kim until it is over. News of the possible trip by Mr. Kim led to rampant speculation in South Korea. Possible motives cited by analysts in Seoul included the North’s need for Chinese aid because of flooding and the possibility of a decline in Mr. Kim’s health, which might have forced aides to take him to China for treatment. Many intelligence officials believe Mr. Kimhad a stroke in 2008. Around the time that Mr. Kim’s train crossed the border, North Korean news media reported that China would provide emergency flood relief. With North Korea’s relations with the South and the United States at a low point, “China is the only one Kim Jong-il can go to to seek aid,” said Kim Keun-sik, an analyst at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. “He badly needs aid before the party meeting to make it a national festival, as it is meant to be.” Even so, leaving North Korea without meeting Mr. Carter would be a notable breach of diplomatic etiquette, the analyst said. “A possible political message of this is that North Korea gives its priority to China over the United States,” he said. China’s Foreign Ministry had no comment on the visit. Two teachers told The Associated Press that Mr. Kim spent 20 minutes Thursday at Yuwen Middle School in Jilin, in the northeast, where his father, Kim Il-sung, attended classes from 1927 to 1930. A secretary who answered the phone Thursday afternoon said “an important person” had visited but said she did not know who it was. Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at People’s University in Beijing, said a visit by Kim Jong-il could offer a diplomatic respite from the pressure being exerted by South Korea and the United States. John Delury, senior fellow of the Center on U.S.-China Relations of the Asia Society in New York, said Mr. Kim’s reported trip begged for explanation. Mr. Delury said he was skeptical that Mr. Kim would have gone to China in person to seek a breakthrough in the stalled six-nation talks on ending his country’snuclear weaponsprograms. “That’s what diplomats are for,” he said.

Beijing confirmed that a plane that crashed Tuesday in northeasternChina, about 90 miles from the North Korean border, belonged toNorth Korea’s military and strayed into Chinese territory because of a mechanical failure, the official Xinhua News Agency said Thursday. The pilot was said to have died on impact. The crash of what appeared to be a MIG-21 fighter jet spurred speculation that its pilot was a defector from  North Korea. Xinhua said that China and North Korea had “reached consensus” on dealing with the aftermath of the accident, though it did not elaborate except to say that North Korea “expressed regret” for the crash. China generally avoids openly criticizing or embarrassing the North Korean government.

SEOUL, South Korea — A special train carryingKim Jong-il,North Korea’s reclusive leader, crossed intoChinaearly Monday on a  trip to his country’s last remaining major ally, the news agency Yonhap and other South Korean news media reported. The visit, if confirmed, would be Mr. Kim’s first to China in four years and the first time he has left North Korea since reports that he suffered a stroke in 2008. The 17-car train crossed the steel bridge between the northeastern North Korean town of Sinuiju to the Chinese city of Dandong at 5:20 a.m., Yonhap reported without citing sources. The Chinese authorities beefed up security around the bridge and the Dandong railway station, deploying police officers and soldiers at  intervals of 10 feet, the Yonhap report said. Other South Korean news media, such as the mass-circulation daily newspaper Chosun and the news cable channel YTN, carried similar reports. South Korean news outlets issued similar reports in the past month about a trip by Mr. Kim, but they turned out to be false alarms. Mr. Kim’s trips have always been kept secret until after they were over. Officials in Seoul said Monday that they could not confirm the reports. But they have said recently that Mr. Kim might travel to China soon. “The special train carrying Kim Jong-il is headed toward Dalian,” Yonhap quoted a "well-connected diplomatic source" in Beijing as saying, referring to an industrial Chinese port. The reported trip comes at a particularly delicate time. North Korea’s economic woes have deepened since the United Nations Security Council tightened sanctions following the North’s nuclear test in 2009.  Tensions in the Korean Peninsula have increased in the past month after the March 26 sinking of a South Korean warship.  South Korea suspects  North Korea caused it with a torpedo. Some South Korean news reports have speculated that Mr. Kim might take his son, Kim Jong-un, on a trip to China to introduce him as his heir.

North Korea on Monday indicated it would not give up its nuclear weapons until the U.S. signed a new peace treaty.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreaon Monday proposed talks with the United States to reach a formal peace treaty that would replace the truce that halted the Korean War 57 years ago, indicating that it would not give up itsnuclear weaponsuntil Washington signed such an accord. North Korea said peace talks should be held either as part of thesix-nation talksthat focus on ending its nuclear weapons program or as a separate negotiation. But the North also warned that it would not return to six-nation talks — from which it withdrew last April — unless the United Nations lifted sanctions imposed after the North’s nuclear and ballistic missile tests last year. The North had previously proposed peace negotiations with the United States and South Korea. But its latest overture came as it was trying to shift the focus of the six-nation talks, where a peace treaty had been set aside until North Korea made significant progress toward dismantling its nuclear weapons program. “If a peace treaty is signed, it will help resolve hostile relations between North Korea and the United States and speed up the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” the North Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement carried by the North’s state-run news agency, K.C.N.A. After years of unsuccessful talks with Washington, North Korea said it concluded that all agreements were bound to collapse unless the two sides built mutual “trust.” To build such confidence, the statement said, “It is essential to conclude a peace treaty for terminating the state of war, a root cause of the hostile relations.” The statement reiterated North Korea’s contention that it would not have built nuclear weapons if the United States had assured it of peace. Stephen W. Bosworth, President Obama’s special representative on North Korea, whovisited the capital, Pyongyang, last month,said the United States could discuss a peace treaty and other incentives only when the process of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula had gained “significant traction.” Last week, Foreign Minister Yu Myung-hwan of South Korea denounced what he called the North’s “unrealistic” demand that the United States negotiate a peace treaty before the North considers relinquishing its nuclear weapons. “That’s like saying it will never give up its nuclear programs, or it is a delaying tactic” to buy time to further its nuclear programs, he said. On Monday, North Korea suggested that peace talks be held among the signatories of the Korean War armistice: the American-led United Nations Command in Seoul, China and North Korea. South Korea refused to sign the truce, but Seoul and Washington insist that any peace talks include the South. Between 1997 and 1999, the two Koreas, the United States and China held six rounds of peace talks that produced no agreement because the North insisted on the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea and an end to joint United States-South Korean military exercises. “With its peace proposal, North Korea is trying to gain the initiative as it prepares to return to six-nation talks,” said Kim Yong-hyun, a North Korea analyst at Dongguk University in Seoul. Mr. Kim expected some haggling between the governments in Pyongyang and Seoul over whether South Korea should be included. Earlier Monday,Robert R. King, Mr. Obama’s envoy on North Korean human rights issues, said during a visit to Seoul that the North’s “appalling” human rights situation would impede any efforts to normalize ties. He also called Monday for the release of Robert Park, a Korean-American missionary who crossed into North Korea last month to demand the release of an estimated 160,000 political prisoners held in labor camps, according to his supporters in Seoul. North Korea has confirmed that it has detained an American citizen but has not identified him by name.

SEOUL —Japanon Friday condemnedNorth Korea’s plan to launch a rocket next month, warning that it can legally shoot down any threatening object if it falls toward its territory. North Korea told international agencies earlier this week that it plans to put a communications satellite into orbit between April 4 and 8, using a rocket that will fly over Japan and likely drop spent fuel stages into the Pacific. The announcement unsettled neighboring countries that consider the launching a cover for testing the North’s Taepodong-2 intercontinental ballistic missile. On Thursday, Washington, Seoul and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon all urged Pyongyang to cancel its plans. "They can call it a satellite or whatever, but it would be a violation" of a United Nations resolution, said Prime Minister Taro Aso of Japan. The United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution banning North Korea from nuclear tests and ballistic missile activities after the Communist state detonated its first nuclear device in 2006. "Under our law, we can intercept any object if it is falling towards Japan, including any attacks on Japan, for our safety," said the Japanese government’s top spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Takeo Kawamura. If North Korea’s rocket launching is successful, it will not fall toward Japan but rather fly over it. North Korea has said that it will consider any attempt to intercept its rocket “an act of war” and that it will attack the interceptors. This week, North Korea gave map coordinates for two danger areas where its rocket’s spent boosters were expected to fall. One zone lies in waters less than 75 miles, or 120 kilometers, from Japan’s northwestern shore. The other lies in the middle of the Pacific between Japan and Hawaii. It was unclear from Mr. Kawamura’s comments whether Japan will try shoot down a jettisoned rocket booster if it falls toward its territory. Japan, which has been developing a missile defense system with the United States, has said it is ready to intercept an incoming missile.

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said the United States would have a “great openness” to the country if it gave up its nuclear ambitions.

ELMENDORF AIR FORCE BASE, Alaska — Secretary of StateHillary Rodham Clinton, en route to Asia on her inaugural foreign trip, struck a conciliatory tone towardNorth Koreaon Sunday, saying the United States would have a “great openness” to the country if it gave up its nuclear ambitions. “Our position is when they move forward in presenting a verifiable and complete dismantling and denuclearization, we have a great openness to working with them,” Mrs. Clinton said on her plane heading to Tokyo, the first stop on a tour of Japan, Indonesia, South Korea and China. “It’s not only on the diplomatic front,” she said, adding that the United States had a “willingness to help the people of North Korea, not just in narrow ways with food and fuel but with energy assistance.” Mrs. Clinton’s words did not represent a shift in United States policy, which is to offer the North Korean government economic aid and other incentives for abandoning its nuclear weapons program. But her tone was notably softer than previous pronouncements by American officials. At the same time, she said the North Korean government needed to be more forthcoming about “the human tragedy” of Japanese citizens who had been abducted by the North in the 1970s and 1980s. As Mrs. Clinton departed Washington, North Korea was casting a shadow over a voyage that sought to build solidarity between the United States and Asia on issues like the global economic crisis andclimate change. North Korea has engaged in bellicose talk toward the South, and there were reports on Sunday that the North was preparing to test a long-range missile. Mrs. Clinton played down suspicions, long held by some in the Bush administration, that North Korea has a clandestine program to produce highly enriched uranium. What is not in dispute, she said, is that North Korea has plutonium, which it is using to manufacture nuclear weapons. In China, Mrs. Clinton said, she would pursue a partnership on climate change. She suggested, though, that she did not intend to press Beijing to accept mandatory caps on carbon emissions, as President Obama supports. She also praised the Chinese government for adopting a “robust” economic stimulus program. While she said she would raise human-rights concerns in Beijing, she does not plan to do so prominently. Mrs. Clinton also said she would meet with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, in two weeks for what she said she hoped would be a “positive start.” She said the administration had made no decisions on whether to scale back a missile defense system in Eastern Europe that has caused tension between Moscow and Washington. Mrs. Clinton’s choice of Japan for her first stop is heavily symbolic and meant to reassure the Japanese that they remain America’s central allies in Asia.  Japan looms large in efforts to recover from the global economic crisis and has pledged up to $100 billion in aid to the International Monetary Fund to help countries facing credit shortages because of the crisis.

It has taken four months and complex negotiations to transfer the money, contained in accounts frozen at the bank.
==::==
2007-07-03T00:00:00Z
==::==
WASHINGTON  — When the United States blacklisted a tiny bank in Macao for its dealings with North Korea nearly two years ago, the goal was to isolate the bank from the world’s financial system and squeeze the government in Pyongyang. Little did the Bush administration appreciate the fatefulness of that step. It has taken four months to transfer $25 million, contained in accounts frozen at the bank, to North Korea as part of a deal reached in February to persuade the North to begin dismantling its nuclear weapons program. The money finally reached North Korea in late June  after several false starts. The transfer was negotiated by the State and Treasury Departments, and it involved the central banks of Russia and Macao; the Far Eastern Commercial Bank, a private  bank in Vladivostok; and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The final arrangement also involved a general discussion of its terms between President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia at the Group of 8 summit meeting in Germany in June. It remains to be seen how quickly North Korea will live up to its promise on its nuclear program. But American officials say that Treasury Department financial sanctions are now proved to have an extraordinary reach, with implications for sanctions imposed and likely to be tightened for other countries, from Iran to Sudan. “Our financial tools are sometimes the most powerful weapons our government has to help change behavior,” said James R. Wilkinson, chief of staff at the Treasury Department. “At the end of the day after this transaction, the diplomacy is moving forward and the world now sees just how powerful Treasury’s financial tools really are.” For weeks, it did not look as if the United States would be able to make the transfer happen without formally lifting its sanctions on Banco Delta Asia in Macao, which would have been a step too far for Washington. Administration officials say both Macao, a semi-autonomous region off the coast of China near Hong Kong, and the Chinese government wanted Washington to withdraw its label of Banco Delta Asia as a money laundering bank, but the administration refused because of lingering concerns about control of the bank by people with a history of illicit activities. Administration officials agreed to talk anonymously about some details in the transaction, saying they wanted to assure the public that the financial controls were not bent, and to send a message that the controls remain in effect for other targets, notably Iran. “You can be sure that other countries like Iran will be drawing lessons from North Korea,” said a senior administration official. “What Banco Delta Asia demonstrates is that once you find yourself in this tar pit, it’s almost impossible to extract yourself. That has huge implications for banks we’ve targeted in Iran.” The United States never froze the North Korean funds in the bank, Treasury officials noted. That was done by the authorities in Macao. By labeling Banco Delta Asia a money launderer for the North’s illicit activities, no reputable bank would do business with it, they said. At issue in the North Korea negotiations was $25 million in the bank held by 52 account holders. The account holders did not include the government of North Korea itself. But nearly all had links with the government through business deals or other connections. Of the 52 accounts, 35  held $13 million that was considered relatively legitimate. Another 17 accounts holding $12 million were believed to be derived from illicit activities like narcotics, counterfeiting and North Korea’s nuclear program. When it was decided in February to return the money to North Korea, both State and Treasury officials thought mistakenly it could be done easily. A team led by Mr. Wilkinson and also including Daniel Glaser, a deputy assistant secretary for terrorist financing and financial crimes, and James H. Freis Jr., director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network at Treasury, flew to Beijing in March to try to untangle the situation. It turned out that the North Korean government, which promised to use the money for humanitarian purposes, was required by law to get permission from the 52 account holders to give up the money to Pyongyang. It took weeks to obtain releases from most of the account holders. North Korea designated the Far Eastern Commercial Bank in Russia, where it had an account, to receive the funds, but that bank had no formal relationship with Banco Delta Asia that would allow for the funds to be wired. No other bank would transfer the money, even when the Treasury Department sent signals that it would offer assurances to hold any bank harmless in participating in the transfer. One paradox was that, according to administration officials, it fell to the State Department — notably Christopher R. Hill, the United States envoy to North Korea — to recruit banks for the job of executing the transfer. They said it was considered inappropriate for Treasury, as an enforcer of banking regulations, to ask banks to do so. Mr. Hill spent weeks “flailing around” to find banks, at one point coming close to a deal involving Wachovia Bank, which backed out because of concerns about handling “hot money,” an administration official said. Finally, administration officials said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York offered to become involved. It did so only after the Macao bank first transferred the funds to the Macao Monetary Authority, the region’s own central bank. The funds  were next transferred from the Macao authority to the New York Fed, then to the Russian Central Bank and then to the Far Eastern bank in Vladivostok, where North Korea’s account was under the name of the North Korean Foreign Trade Bank. Russia was willing to honor American requests to help, administration officials said, but it wanted assurances that its financial institutions would not be punished by any anti-money laundering statutes or regulations. These were given by the American ambassador in Moscow, William J. Burns. Like Banco Delta Asia, two Iranian banks have been blacklisted by the Treasury Department: Bank Saderat because of allegations of involvement in financing Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations, and Bank Sepah because of reported involvement in Iran’s suspected nuclear arms program. Since last September, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. has been publicly calling on banks in Europe, the Middle East and Asia to stop doing business with Bank Saderat and Bank Sepah even if the transactions do not involve dollars. “Most of the world’s top financial institutions have now dramatically reduced their Iranian business or stopped it altogether,” Mr. Paulson said in June in a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. He added that “the risk of transacting Iran’s business is present in every currency.”

Two of the world’s most repressive nations restored diplomatic ties with one another today after more than two decades of estrangement.
==::==

==::==
BANGKOK, Thailand, April 26 — United in their hostility toward America, two of the world’s most repressive nations,MyanmarandNorth Korea, restored diplomatic ties with one another today after more than two decades of estrangement. Their diplomatic reunion, in a visit so low-key that it seemed almost a secret mission, was far quieter than the rupture of October 1983, a month after North Korean agents set off a powerful bomb in the heart of the country that was then known as Burma. The bomb narrowly missed killing the former South Korean president, Chun Doo Hwan, during an official visit to Yangon, the capital, which was then known as Rangoon. More than 20 other people were killed, including several high ranking South Korean officials, and at least 40 more were wounded by the blast, which was heard miles away. Relations between the two nations have quietly been warming in recent years, as both states, treated as pariahs by the West, sought friends in Asia. “You can say it’s a case of outposts of tyranny getting together,” said Aung Naing Oo, an exile from Myanmar who is a political commentator in Thailand, alluding to a phrase used by Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice in 2005 to describe the two nations and four others around the world, including Iran, Cuba, Zimbabwe and Belarus. Myanmar and North Korea are each subject to economic sanctions and harsh condemnation from Washington, and each seems to consider itself threatened militarily by the United States. There is a difference, though. North Korea, with its nuclear weapons, really does face a potential military confrontation with the United States. Similar fears among the generals who rule Myanmar are apparently one reason for their move last year to a secure new capital that is part administrative center, part military base. “I think we regard the threat to Burma as preposterous, as Americans,” said David Steinberg, a professor at Georgetown University who is an expert on Myanmar. “But the Burmese take this seriously. There are groups inside Burma that would want this to happen.” It is not clear that the new relationship between Myanmar and North Korea will be much more than symbolic. Experts on Myanmar dismiss the notion put forward by some exiles that nuclear weaponry could be involved. “There has been speculation about nuclear activity, but it’s been pooh-poohed by experts on the matter,” said Robert Taylor, a London-based consultant on Myanmar affairs. Win Min, an exile from Myanmar who teaches political science at Chiang Mai University in Thailand, said, “I doubt, with their money and with their level of education —— To get nuclear technology? I doubt it.” North Korea does have conventional arms and military expertise to offer, and there has been speculation that it may already be supplying some weapons. Myanmar, for its part, can offer natural resources in the kind of barter arrangement it prefers, experts said. “Myanmar likes trade relations with almost everybody,” Mr. Taylor said, relying primarily on China, India and Russia to neutralize sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe. The Myanmar junta has been reaching out to other countries that are shunned by the United States as well, like Iran, Venezuela and Cuba. Despite the poverty of its own people, “Myanmar is a source of cheap food,” Mr. Taylor said, despite the deep poverty of its own people. “North Korea might be seeing an advantage in that.” The agreement was signed without fanfare during a three-day visit by Vice Foreign Minister Kim Yong Il of North Korea. Myanmar’s deputy foreign minister, Kyaw Thu, made today’s announcement to reporters, saying that it would be up to the North Koreans to decide whether to open a diplomatic mission in the new Myanmar capital, Nay Phi Daw. Other nations have refused to move their embassies to Nay Phi Daw, remain in what is now officially only the commercial capital, Yangon, an eight-hour drive away over bad roads. South Korea seems to have buried the past along with Myanmar. It had already signaled that it had no objection to the resumption of ties between Myanmar and the North. On Wednesday the Reuters news agency quoted an official of the Foreign Ministry in Seoul as saying South Korea respected Myanmar’s decision. “Furthermore, we hope this restoration will lead to the opening of North Korea, and hope it will contribute to peace and stability within your country,” the official was quoted as saying. As it expanded its foreign relations, Myanmar continued on what it says is its march toward democracy, with plans to resume later this year — and perhaps finally complete — a slow-moving constitutional convention. That is to be followed by a national election. Outside analysts say the generals will make sure they win, after a humiliating loss in 1990 in a parliamentary vote that they found it necessary to annul. That election was won by the National League for Democracy, headed by Aung San Suu Kyi. Many of its members have since been imprisoned, and Aung San Suu Kyi remains under house arrest, where she has been for most of the past decade. “They’ll have a referendum, they will win, and at some point in the future they’ll have an election, which they’ve got it made in because of the terms of their new constitution,” Mr. Steinberg of Georgetown University said.

Banco Delta Asia, accused of committing financial crimes for North Korea, challenged a U.S. ruling that bars the bank from access to the U.S. financial system.

SHANGHAI, April 16 — TheMacaobank that was a stumbling block to international efforts to dismantle the North Korean nuclear weapons program  challenged on Monday aUnited States Treasury Departmentruling that bars the bank from access to the American financial system. Banco Delta Asia, a family-owned bank that the United States has accused of committing financial crimes on behalf ofNorth Korea, said in a statement that the March 14 ruling was “politically motivated” because it was based on disputes between the United States and North Korea. In its filing with the Treasury Department, the bank also called for the decision to be revoked on the grounds that it was made without supporting evidence, ignored remedial measures the bank had taken and denied the bank the opportunity to respond to fresh accusations, the statement said. “In this filing, the bank seeks a fair hearing on all the evidence, free from political intervention and the distraction of public diplomacy,” Joseph McLaughlin, a lawyer for Banco Delta Asia in New York, said in the statement. “We are confident that the U.S. legal system, in the end, will not countenance the sacrifice of legal rights to political ends.” Banco Delta Asia, and its owner, Stanley Au, a prominent Macao businessman and an adviser to the Chinese government, have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. A Treasury Department spokeswoman, Molly Millerwise, said the department had confidence in the merits of its action against Banco Delta Asia. The bank was drawn into the complex diplomacy surrounding the North Korean nuclear weapons program when the Treasury Department, in September 2005, accused it of acting as a “willing pawn” for North Korea in a range of illicit activities, including money laundering and distributing counterfeit American currency. After an 18-month investigation, the Treasury Department ruled March 14 that under  the  Patriot Act, American financial institutions would be barred from doing business with Banco Delta Asia. The Treasury Department’s accusations in September 2005 clearly angered North Korea, which subsequently boycotted the six-nation talks about its nuclear program for more than a year. North Korea returned to the talks late last year and agreed on Feb. 13 to shut down its main plutonium producing reactor within 60 days in return for energy aid. It has not done so.

Nations agreed to provide roughly $400 million in food, fuel and other aid as North Korea dismantles its nuclear facilities and allows inspectors.

BEIJING, Feb. 13 —North Koreaagreed today to close its main nuclear reactor in exchange for a package of food, fuel and other aid from the United States, China, South Korea and Russia. The breakthrough, which was announced by the Chinese government after intense negotiations and welcomed by the White House as a “very important first step,” comes four months after North Korea tested a nuclear bomb. The partner nations agreed to provide roughly $400 million worth of various kinds of aid in return for the North starting the process of permanently disabling its nuclear facilities and allowing inspectors into the country. Perhaps equally important, the United States and Japan, which also took part in the talks, agreed to discuss normalizing relations with the Pyongyang regime. The United States will also begin the process of removing North Korea from its list of terror-sponsoring states, and lifting trade and financial sanctions. In September, 2005, the United States, North Korea and four other nations signed a draft accord in which the North promised to abandon efforts to produce nuclear weapons and re-admit international inspectors to its nuclear facilities, but leaving open a range of issues for future talks. “Today’s announcement represents the first step toward implementing that agreement,”  President Bush said in a statement. He said that the talks were the best opportunity to use diplomacy to address North Korea’s nuclear program. The White House spokesman, Tony Snow, said that the new agreement was stronger than previous deals with North Korea because the United States was not the only other party. “There is still a possibility of sanctions through the international community,” Mr. Snow said. “And there is considerably more leverage on the North Koreans, by virtue of the fact that you have the Chinese, the South Koreans, the Japanese and the Russians also involved here. They’re answerable not merely to the United States, but in fact to their own neighbors, who are significant stakeholders in this.” Mr. Snow also said that the North Koreans would be under an obligation to disclose everything publicly, and said that there would be very specific requirements from the North Koreans, including shutting down the Yongbyon nuclear plant and enrichment facilities. Mr. Snow said the breakthrough was a result of “some very tough and hard-nosed diplomacy.” But the agreement drew strong criticism from John Bolton, a former United States ambassador to the United Nations, who urged President Bush to reject it. He called it a “charade” and a “hollow agreement.” “I am very disturbed by this deal,” Mr. Bolton told CNN. “It sends exactly the wrong signal to would-be proliferators around the world: ‘If we hold out long enough, wear down the State Department negotiators, eventually you get rewarded,’ in this case with massive shipments of heavy fuel oil, for doing only partially what needs to be done.” He added that the agreement focused too narrowly on Yongbyon. “That is not nearly the entire threat,” Mr. Bolton said, adding that the agreement says nothing about the stock of nuclear weapons North Korea already possesses. Japan has not agreed to join the other four countries in providing the aid package to the North, saying that it cannot take part until some bilateral issues between Japan and the North are worked out. Abductions of Japanese citizens by the North over the Cold War years are the main issue. The accord sets a 60-day deadline for North Korea to accomplish its first steps toward disarmament, and leaves until an undefined moment — and to another negotiation — the actual removal of North Korea’s nuclear weapons and the fuel manufactured to produce them. Under the agreement, the first part of the aid — 50,000 tons of fuel oil, or an equivalent value of economic or humanitarian aid — will be provided by South Korea, Russia, China and the United States; in the case of the United States, doing so requires congressional approval, which Mr. Bush is likely to have a difficult time securing. In return for disabling the reactor and declaring all its nuclear programs, the North is to eventually receive another 950,000 tons of oil in stages. Further negotiations among the six nations are scheduled to begin on March 19 in Beijing. “It’s about actions for actions,” Gordon Johndroe, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said this morning. “We have leverage because they’re under a U.N. Security Council sanctions regime.” The agreement was read aloud this morning to all the delegates, gathered in a conference room at a Chinese state guesthouse in Beijing. The Chinese envoy, Wu Dawei, then asked if there were any objections. When none were made, the officials all stood and applauded. Though Mr. Hill and other envoys spoke to reporters about the accord as soon as it had been reached, in the small hours of this morning, the formal announcement was not made by China, host of the talks, until this afternoon. During a ceremony televised nationally, the chief Chinese negotiator, Wu Dawei, praised the participating nations for their flexibility and declared the deal a “successful ending.” Negotiators spent five days trying to reach a deal but were stymied until the very end by North Korean demands for large amounts of energy aid. Mr. Hill said he and the North Korean envoy, Kim Kye-gwan, had initially agreed at an informal January meeting in Berlin that the amount of energy promised to the North would not be specified until working groups were established. But the North insisted at the neijing talks that a hard figure be set in the new agreement. Ultimately, the delegations agreed on 1 million tons of fuel oil. But the pil will not all come right away: After the first 50,000 tons are delivered in the initial 60-day period, the remainder will be tied delivered as the North meets later requirements to disclose and disable its nuclear arsenal. The United States is obliged to make progress on its promises in the 60-day period as well, including starting bilateral discussions on various issues with the North. At the end of the 60 days, the agreement calls for the foreign ministers of the six nations to meet and discuss, among other things, security cooperation in Northeast Asia. A separate forum would also be created to negotiate a permanent peace treaty for the Korean Peninsula, replacing the armistice that stopped the fighting in the 1950-53 Korean War but has never formally ended the war. The ultimate goal is the complete denuclearization of North Korea, and the next round of talks is expected to begin to wade into the thicket of disputes over how to carry this out. North Korea has sidestepped some previous agreements, and is thought to have many mountainside tunnels where it can hide nuclear materials and projects from foreign observers if it chooses. The agreement obliges the North to provide a complete list of its nuclear programs, including an inventory of its plutonium stockpile. It must also disable all its nuclear facilities, including “graphite-moderated reactors and reprocessing facilities.” International inspectors are to verify the process. The agreement marks a major change of course for the Bush administration, which has been beset by six years of virulent internal arguments over whether to negotiate with North Korea or to try to squeeze its government until it collapses. The administration ultimately settled on pursuing a deal through the six-nation talks because of a view that North Korea would be more likely to honor a deal if China were a party to it. “If they renege on this,” said one senior Bush administration official, who would not speak on the record because the deal had yet to be signed, “they are sticking their fingers into the eyes of the Chinese.” Nonetheless, some administration officials acknowledged that they had concluded that a step-by-step accord was their only choice, and that it would be impossible to set a schedule for the North’s disarmament without taking initial steps to build trust. The disarmament process promises to be enormously complex, far harder than dismantling Libya’s comparatively small nuclear complex three years ago. Libya never produced nuclear material, whereas North Korea is believed to have made one or two weapons, or the fuel for them, nearly two decades ago, and perhaps a half dozen or more since 2003. But American officials are uncertain exactly how many weapons the North possesses, and in the second phase of the accord, the North would have to explain what it did with the uranium-enrichment equipment that it apparently purchased in the 1990’s from the Pakistani nuclear engineer Abdul Qadeer Khan, whose network also supplied Iran and Libya. Some experts doubt that the North will ever agree to turn over its weapons, which it considers its main bargaining chip with the West, and Kim Jong-Il’s only insurance policy against being toppled as the country’s leader.

An exhibition in Vienna of propagandistic North Korean artworks has garnered condemnation and suspicion since it opened in May.
==::==
2010-08-15T00:00:00Z
==::==
VIENNA “WHY?” is the question Peter Noever,  the director of the Museum of Applied Arts here, says he is constantly asked about a sprawling exhibition of propagandistic North Korean artworks now on view. The show has garnered   condemnation and suspicion since it opened in May, just as international tensions flared overNorth Korea’s alleged sinking of a South Korean naval ship. The exhibition encompasses more than 100 oil paintings and watercolors from North Korea’s national museum, known as the Korean Art Gallery Pyongyang, as well as architectural drawings and models. This is the first time that secretive totalitarian state has sent a large number of its artworks outside its sealed borders. Until now the country’s cultural proclivities have been known to the outside world primarily through television broadcasts of bizarrely choreographed dancing and gymnastics extravaganzas performed by up to 100,000 adults and children. The Vienna show gives another, somewhat more intimately scaled perspective on the controlled aesthetics of a dystopia where many citizens must scavenge for food and are subject to forced labor, torture and other repressive measures. A cotton-candy palette predominates in the eerily upbeat paintings, whose high technical proficiency is matched by a severely limited range of subjects. Dutiful farmers, steelworkers, street sweepers and seamstresses all beam with joy; well-nourished children laugh in dazzling sunlight. “We Are the Happiest Children in the World”  is one surreal title. An   image from 2000  —  just after the peak years of a famine estimated to have cost three million lives  —  depicts the portly dictator Kim Jong-il lifting the lid off a steaming pot in a kitchen laden with succulent meats and fruits as two white-toqued chefs and an army officer stand by. “The Supreme Commander Kim Jong-il Deeply Concerned Over the Soldiers’ Diet,”  reads the caption. The bulk of the exhibition comprises art created in the last 10 years. These blissful landscapes, street and domestic scenes are hung in open galleries, but monumental depictions of Kim Jong-il and his father  —  the “Great Leader” Kim Il-sung  —  are tucked away in roped-off alcoves where guards prevent visitors from getting close. “We’re here to make sure the pictures won’t be damaged,” a guard said. Along with protecting what are considered North Korean national treasures, the museum is doing everything possible to avoid offending the lending nation. The exhibition and 229-page catalog are devoid of any critical text referring to the content of the pictures or the political context in which they arose. Asymposiuminvolving specialists in North Korean art and politics has been scheduled, but only on the eve of the exhibition’s closing on Sept. 5. “It’s totally clear that if we were to have contextualized this exhibition, as some wanted us to, the exhibition would not have taken place,” Mr. Noever conceded in an  interview. While North Korea’s minister of culture wrote in the catalog that he hopes the show will contribute to “deepening mutual understanding” and exchange, the museum in Vienna said North Korea refused to allow any of the featured artists to travel to Austria . “Is it ethical to show the propaganda works of a dictatorial regime?” a correspondent from the former East bloc asked  the exhibition’s curator, Bettina M. Busse,  at a  press preview on May 18. Under the glare of camera lights, Ms. Busse told Czech Television: “There seems to be a misunderstanding of the topic. We’re concerned with culture.” The German newspaper Die Welt disagreed, condemning the exhibition,“Flowers for Kim Il-sung,”as “obscene.” The paper said that in a “terror regime” like North Korea there is “no perceptible visual art according to an acceptable understanding of any sort.” The North Koreans themselves had trouble grasping the appeal of their artwork to the Viennese. “They didn’t understand it for a long time,” Mr. Noever said. “What interests me are artists who are apart and little-known cultures to which one has little access and about which one has little information.” Arranging the exhibition involved four visits to Pyongyang starting in 2003 and protracted negotiations, he   said. No money  was paid for borrowing the works. Just three days before the exhibition opening, North Korea’s ambassador to Austria came to Mr. Noever’s office to ask once again why he was putting on the show. “There were anxieties,” Mr. Noever said. “The North Koreans feared it was propaganda against North Korea.” Many Austrians, meanwhile, have accused  Mr. Noever of  burnishing the image of the regime in Pyongyang. The Austrian finance ministry, which usually provides insurance protection on art loans from abroad to government-supported museums like Mr. Noever’s, refused to do so for this show. “This exhibition shows a covert sympathy,” said a ministry spokesman, Daniel Kapp, “and the finance minister decided we will not contribute.” Mr. Noever provoked further furor with his catalog essay lamenting that “our Western ideological lenses cloud, if not entirely distort, the view of other realities” and urging museumgoers to “bid farewell once and for all to Eurocentric and culturally imperialistic attitudes.” The show, he argued, “proves that cultural differences can be bridged with mutual respect.” As museum director for the past 24 years, Mr. Noever has demonstrated a flair for attention-getting projects. He brought in Jenny Holzer and Donald Judd to energize the displays of Biedermeier furniture, Mamluk carpets and assorted applied arts in what had become a fusty storehouse  founded as an imperial entity in 1864; organized surveys of Soviet art; opened an art center in  Los Angeles; and is seeking to transform one of Vienna’s Nazi-era antiaircraft towers into a contemporary art space. “Noever is no fool,” the Viennese daily Die Presse said of the North Korean spectacle, “but rather the leading Austrian exemplar of leftist radical chic.” The show is unlikely to win North Korea any new adherents abroad, but many Korea experts   concur  it may help promote dialogue, albeit limited. “It is important to engage in cultural projects with different countries, even if the regime is one we might not like,” said Jane Portal, who heads the Asian department at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and is the author of abook on North Korean art. “Engagement is better than total lack of communication.” Even though Austria backs sanctions against Pyongyang to deter its nuclear arms buildup, Vienna apparently retains a special allure for the North Koreans. It long served as a base for shopping sprees to supply the North Korean elite with luxury goods, according to a memoir by a North Korean colonel who oversaw such purchases before defecting to Austria and publishing the book in March. Last year Italian police blocked an Austrian intermediary from buying  two yachts for Kim Jong-il. Yet it’s not just shopping that North Koreans seem to like about Vienna. In the last decade Pyongyang sent 17 students to the  renowned University of Music and Performing Arts to learn to  conduct. The Vienna museum has in turn repaid the North Korean affection with a tongue-in-cheek exhibition title relating to the use of flowers to glorify the North Korean leadership. In 1965 President Sukarno of Indonesia presented Kim Il-sung with a hybrid orchid named Kimilsungia. Then a new type of begonia bred in 1988 was named Kimjongilia after the current leader and called the “immortal flower.” Festivals devoted to these blossoms are held regularly in North Korea. At the Vienna exhibition sprays of artificial silk Kimilsungia and Kimjongilia adorn the entry. “The North Koreans don’t get the irony of it,” Ms. Portal said of the florid title, which “many people who look at the exhibit think it’s a bit of a joke.” “However much we may think of it as a joke or odd,” she said, “we’ve seen it all before in terms of communist and totalitarian societies  —  from the Soviet Union to the Nazis to China. This is the last remnant of that, the last bastion of this kind of thinking that’s bound to disappear. That’s why it’s so important for it to be seen and collected for posterity.”

Regarding Joel Wit’s “Don’t sink diplomacy” (Views, May 20): Even though diplomacy is the best way to resolve the Cheonan incident, it does not mean that the Obama administration should engage in bilateral talks with North Korea. This is what North Korea has demanded for a long time, and granting it now is equivalent to rewarding North Korea for its hostile action. Also, the United States and its allies need to find ways to punish North Korea other than resorting to the U.N. Security Council. The intention behind the sinking of the Cheonan was not to begin a war but to improve the morale of the North Korean military and to strengthen the internal solidarity before the power transfer from Kim Jong-Il to his heir. Doowon Lee, New York New world order There are a couple of messages that I infer from the editorial “Iran’s failed gambit” (May 20). First and foremost, Russia and China probably realized that they cannot weaken the Security Council and the United Nations itself by acquiescing to side deals struck by nonpermanent members who are eager to play larger international roles. More importantly, however, it is time the five permanent members of the Security Council recognized that its post-World War II structure is no longer representative of the geopolitical and economic realities of the world. For starters, the other two members of the so-called BRIC nations — Brazil and India — must be made permanent members of the Security Council. It might also make sense to add Germany, Japan and South Africa to more accurately reflect the evolution of the international paradigm over the past six decades. A logical expansion along these lines would ensure the longevity of the body for several more decades to come. But more significantly, it would prevent difficult regimes from attempting power plays in the future — such as the one Iran has currently manipulated. Jack Nargundkar, Germantown, Maryland

SEOUL, South Korea  —  Kim Jong-il, the North Korean leader, told officials in Beijing that his government would try to restart talks on ending itsnuclear weaponsprogram, Chinese news media reported on Friday, as Mr. Kim wrapped up his five-day trip. Mr. Kim’s comment, which did not specify when the North would return to the six-nation talks, did not appear to be  a step forward from what his  government had already said. But its timing, and Mr. Kim’s meeting with President Hu Jintao ofChinathis week, could put South Korea and the United States in an awkward position. Both Seoul and Washington had called for the resumption of the talks. But after a South Korean warship sank on March 26 in an explosion many South Koreans attribute toNorth Korea, Seoul has insisted on finishing the investigation of the sinking -- and if the North is culpable, punishing it -- before engaging the country in denuclearization-for-aid talks. Washington has indicated its agreement. Thus, Mr. Kim’s seeming eagerness to return to talks, if genuine, could disrupt Seoul’s  plans. South Korea watched this week as Beijing invited Mr. Kim, gave him a tour of the Chinese industrial cities of Dalian and Tianjin and reportedly promised economic aid. “The North Korea side stated that its stance in favor of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula has not changed,” the state-run Chinese news agency Xinhua said, referring to Mr. Kim’s meetings with Chinese leaders. “The North Korean side is willing, together with all parties, to discuss creating favorable conditions for restarting the six-party talks.” It remained unclear whether Mr. Kim has eased his government’s conditions for returning to the talks, which it angrily abandoned a year ago. The conditions include  lifting United Nations sanctions and a  commitment from the United States  to undertake  negotiations  on a peace treaty to replace the truce that ended the 1950-3 Korean War. China’s “warm welcome and cordial hospitality” to Mr. Kim this week, as described by  the North’s official news agency, K.C.N.A., deepened South Korean misgivings about the China policy. It also compelled South Korea to speed up its investigation of the ship sinking. On Friday, South Korean news outlets carried leaks from government investigators who reportedly found traces of gunpowder and metal pieces from the sunken ship that are consistent with a torpedo. Officials here privately say that they were increasingly sure that a North Korean attack sank the ship, which killed 46 sailors. Once the investigation was over, “the Chinese government will understand and play a role” in dealing harshly with North Korea, President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea was quoted as telling ruling party officials on Friday. Footage run by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV showed Mr. Kim, 68, hugging Mr. Hu. Mr. Kim, who reportedly suffered a stroke in 2008, looked frail with thinning hair. K.C.N.A. said Mr. Kim was “deeply impressed” and expressed “great appreciation of the tremendous changes” in Dalian and Tianjin, models of China’s rapid economic growth. Xinhua quoted him as saying that he welcomed Chinese investment in his country “based on the principles of mutual benefit and win-win.” The impoverished North’s economic dependence on China deepened after South Korea, once a major provider of aid and trade,  adopted a hard line under Mr. Lee.

The Bush administration appears to be preparing to back away from a demand that North Korea fully disclose all of its past nuclear weapons activities.

WASHINGTON — The Bush administration appears to be preparing to back away from a demand thatNorth Koreafully disclose all of its past nuclear weapons activities, in an attempt to preserve a nuclear agreement requiring it to disclose and dismantle the bulk of its nuclear weapons program. As described by administration officials on Thursday, the step would relax a demand for North Korea to admit fully that it supplied Syria with nuclear technology. The United States would also agree to postpone its demand that North Korea provide an immediate and full accounting of its fledgling uranium program. The new stance is intended to help complete a denuclearization deal that would focus instead on North Korea’s more extensive plutonium program, which has been at the heart of its nuclear weapons development and was the source of raw material for the device it tested in October 2006. The State Department spokesman, Sean D. McCormack, said the emerging agreement would not represent a concession. He said that even if North Korea did not fully account for its uranium efforts, the deal would allow inspectors access to all of North Korea’s nuclear facilities in order to verify that it had stopped its weapons programs. “There is nothing inevitable about this process, and we are reserving judgment about this declaration until we see it,” Mr. McCormack said. “Every aspect will be subject to verification, and if we detect that they have misled or attempted to mislead, there will be diplomatic consequences.” The new approach has been endorsed by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and her chief North Korea negotiator, Christopher R. Hill, an assistant secretary of state, who have argued that getting the plutonium program shut down was better than getting nothing at all, an administration official said. But it is being opposed by conservatives within the administration, including aides to Vice President Dick Cheney, officials said. “A lot of people will say this falls short of the full confession,” a senior administration official said of what the new approach would demand of North Korea. “They want them to appear in Town Hall and acknowledge that they have sinned. But they weren’t willing to go that far.” The administration had previously sought full disclosure of North Korea’s role in the Syria program, which a senior administration official said was destroyed by an Israeli airstrike in Syria last September. Under the new approach, the United States and North Korea have settled on fudging the issue, administration officials said. North Korea will “acknowledge” that the United States is concerned about the nuclear proliferation to Syria but will not publicly admit to it. North Korea will also promise not to engage in any more nuclear proliferation, a senior administration official said. In return, the United States would take North Korea off the list of state sponsors of terrorism and the list of countries noted in the Trading With the Enemy Act. State Department officials, preparing for a storm of protest from conservatives who complain that such an agreement would be too soft on North Korea, hastened to say on Thursday that the United States  would  continue to keep a host of economic sanctions against North Korea, including prohibitions on most foreign aid and limitations on trade. The administration officials who described the new American approach agreed to speak only on condition of anonymity, because North Korea had not yet agreed to the deal. Asked on Thursday whether the United States was scaling back its demands, Ms. Rice responded only obliquely. “We’re going to have to judge whether North Korea has carried out its obligations,” Ms. Rice said during a news conference. “But I will say this: we have a long way to go in terms of all the various statutory sanctions and multilateral and bilateral sanctions that would remain even if the United States were to take the steps that you outlined.” President Bush appears to be supporting Ms. Rice and Mr. Hill, to the dismay of those  who say that the administration, after six years of acting tough on North Korea, is backing down. Defenders of the emerging agreement counter that it would be a mistake to continue a strategy that has yet to produce a lasting deal, and instead allowed North Korea to build up its plutonium stockpile and detonate a nuclear device in 2006. Part of the problem for Mr. Bush is that the proposed deal, which many foreign policy experts say may be the best the United States can hope for at this point, is being judged by standards set up by Mr. Bush himself. The White House now finds itself charting a similar course to the one taken by the Clinton administration in striking a deal with North Korea in 1994. That agreement collapsed in 2002 after the Bush White House accused North Korea of secretly continuing work on a nuclear weapon. Under the new deal, North Korea has agreed to dismantle Yongbyon, as part of an agreement that, like the Clinton deal, envisions that North Korea would ultimately give up all of its nuclear material. John R. Bolton, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations and the most outspoken critic of the accord now taking shape, wrote an op-ed column this week in The Wall Street Journal that compared Mr. Bush unfavorably with Ronald Reagan. “His policy regarding North Korea’s nuclear weapons program looks more like something out of Bill Clinton’s or Jimmy Carter’s playbook,” Mr. Bolton wrote. The administration is sending a negotiating team next week to try to work with the North Koreans on the details of what exactly North Korea would have to disclose about its plutonium program — and how, under such an agreement. “We can’t play ‘trust me’ with plutonium,” one senior administration official said. Nuclear experts at the State Department and other agencies are working on a way to make sure that North Korea discloses its entire plutonium program and capacity. In addition, American officials are pressing North Korea to take steps to alleviate concerns held by Japan, which wants questions resolved about North Korea’s abductions of Japanese citizens. The issue is scheduled to come up over the weekend when Mr. Bush meets with President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea. White House officials say they do not plan to take North Korea at its word. “No one has let them off the hook,” said Dennis Wilder, special assistant to the president and senior director for East Asian affairs.

SEOUL, South Korea, Sept. 22 (AP) —North Korea’s No. 2 leader met with a Syrian delegation in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, on Saturday, the North’s media reported, amid growing international concerns about weapons technology cooperation between the countries. Kim Yong-nam, head of the North’s rubber-stamp legislature, had “a friendly talk” with the Syrian delegation, led by Saaeed Eleia Dawood, director of the organizational department ofSyria’s Baath Arab Socialist Party, the official  Korean Central News Agency reported. The Syrian official expressed satisfaction that the “friendly and cooperative ties” between the countries were growing under President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and Kim Jong-il of North Korea, the news agency said. On Friday, the Syrian official held talks with Choe Tae-bok, a senior official of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party. The delegation’s trip to Pyongyang came amid reports that the United States was investigating whether North Korea might be providing nuclear assistance to Syria. Both countries have denied that accusation. But a recent Israeli airstrike against what some Israeli officials claimed was a Syrian site tied to nuclear development has again stoked a debate over whether Syria is trying to start a program of its own. North Korea has long aided Syria with missile technology, including a sophisticated new class of Scud missiles with longer range and more accuracy than previous models.

WASHINGTON WHEN it comes to finding a way to disarm your enemies, here is a puzzle: How do you decide which dictatorial, nuke-building regimes to negotiate with, and which to freeze out, sanction or intimidate with a couple of aircraft carriers? That, in a nutshell, is a looming question raised by last week’s long-delayed deal withNorth Korea.  Even while hardliners and conservatives were assailing the administration last week for “selling out” toKim Jong Il, some in the administration were wondering  whether there are lessons here for dealing withIran. The deal Mr. Bush approved requires North Korea to stop producing plutonium, seal its giant nuclear facility at Yongbyon and — after a negotiation yet to happen — take apart the nuclear complex. Over the next 60 days, the North also has to invite back the inspectors it threw out of the country four years ago — and declare where it has hidden the rest of its nuclear materials and facilities. That would seem hard enough for the hermit nation, but the next part could be even harder: In return for concessions no one is yet talking about, the North would give up its nuclear arsenal. Many hardened North Korea watchers  say it will never happen. After all, that arsenal, estimated by American intelligence agencies at six to a dozen weapons or the fuel for them, is the only source of power for the isolated, bankrupt Hermit Kingdom. But here’s the curious part: Mr. Bush’s aides worked out this “first step” in one-on-one talks in Berlin of the kind the White House refused to hold a few years back, while North Korea was still busily producing nuclear fuel to make its next generation of weapons. Those are exactly the steps Mr. Bush refuses to take with Tehran. On Wednesday, even while celebrating the North Korean deal, Mr. Bush repeated his bottom line on opening talks with Tehran: They must stop enriching uranium first. So what explains the difference? Why talk to one brutal regime that imprisons its dissidents in gulags, while refusing all kinds of advice — from Republicans, the Iraq Study Group, and others — to start talking to Iran? Inside the White House, the logic goes this way: North Korea’s nuclear program is already “mature,” a delicate way of saying that, thanks to years of failed efforts of administrations that go back three decades, the country has joined the eight other nations known to have nuclear weapons. Insisting on suspending fuel production, one senior administration official said recently, would not gain the United States any leverage. Iran, they argue, is different. It has no weapons — at least not yet. The Americans’ objective is to prevent the Iranians from following the North Korean model, and to avoid waking up some day to news of the Iranian equivalent of North Korea’s nuclear detonation, which took place last October. But President Bush worries, his aides say, that to negotiate with Iran while it is still enriching uranium would be to open up Washington to blackmail. “Think about it,” said one senior administration official. “While we’re talking, the clock ticks. The Iranians can drag this out for years. But while the talks are on, no one is willing to invoke real sanctions” — or threaten, even vaguely, that if the issue isn’t settled soon Mr. Bush or the Israelis might consider “disabling” Iran’s facilities from the air. This results in the American conundrum, made worse by Iran’s ability to cause trouble in Iraq, a problem the administration has been loudly declaring is getting worse. “When you can’t bomb, and you won’t negotiate, you end up in a third box — acquiescing to bad things happening,” said Robert Gallucci, the dean of the Georgetown School of Foreign Service, who was the main American interlocutor with North Korea in the Clinton administration. “Many will say, ‘What about sanctions?’ ” Mr. Gallucci added. But that “often turns out to be acquiescing,” especially if countries like Russia, one of Iran’s biggest trading partners, decline to turn the screws. Of course, what Mr. Bush is facing now is the worst of all those bad choices. With no negotiations underway with Iran, the country has defied theUnited Nationsand is continuing to enrich uranium (though it appears to have run into technical troubles that have slowed its progress). While the Security Council has imposed some mild sanctions, Secretary of StateCondoleezza Riceconcedes that trying to escalate those punishments by passing more Security Council resolutions is probably ineffective. The Russians and the Chinese have made clear they simply won’t go along much farther. That leaves Mr. Bush with the choice of hinting at military action — an option his new secretary of defense, Robert Gates, has all but dismissed. “For the umpteenth time we are not looking for an excuse to go to war with Iran,” he declared the other day, out of exasperation. So, instead, Mr. Bush has chosen to exert more financial pressure against European banks and others who do business with Iran, in hopes of squeezing the country so hard that it decides its leaders have to go. R. Nicholas Burns, the under secretary of state for political affairs, argued in a speech in Washington on Wednesday that the squeeze is working — in ways it could not in North Korea — because Iran is “not a monolithic system, there are many voices, many different points of view.” Mr. Bush mused happily the other day about the troubles that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the Holocaust-questioning president of Iran, is facing from elements of Iranian society that want jobs and visas. What may really be going on here, says Robert S. Litwak, the author of “Regime Change,” is that, “Iran is seen as the more dynamic threat” than North Korea. “That means the administration felt it could defer the core issue of disarmament” in the case of the North; it does not feel that it has that luxury with the Iranians, even if they are years from an actual weapon. But the ultimate lesson of the North Korea case may be that even after sanctions, even after mutual threats, at some point both sides have to take the leap toward negotiations. The Iranians keep sending hints they are ready to do so; on Friday evening, in response to questions, a senior administration official who is at the center of Iran policymaking (but would not agree to be quoted on the record) insisted that “it is not us refusing to talk to the Iranians, but they are refusing to come back” under the conditions the United States and Europe established. North Korea is also a reminder that those conditions can change. Just a year or two ago the deal reached last week would have been rejected by administration hardliners as rewarding bad behavior — and perpetuating one of the world’s most repressive governments. That is still the view of many of the advisers Mr. Bush once relied on. In the last two years of his administration, he has confronted reality in the coldest corner of East Asia. The question now is whether that foreshadows a similar  shift as he confronts the dangers of the hottest corner of the Middle East.

Officials say they have been frustrated trying to block Syria, Iran and North Korea from selling to militants.

WASHINGTON — Just a week after President Bashar al-Assad ofSyriaassured a top State Department official that his government was not sending sophisticated weapons toHezbollah, the Obama administration lodged a confidential protest accusing Syria of doing precisely what it had denied doing. “In our meetings last week it was stated that Syria is not transferring any ‘new’ missiles to Lebanese Hizballah,” noted a cable sent by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in February, using an alternative spelling for the militant group. “We are aware, however, of current Syrian efforts to supply Hizballah with ballistic missiles. I must stress that this activity is of deep concern to my government, and we strongly caution you against such a serious escalation.” A senior Syrian Foreign Ministry official, a cable from the American Embassy in Damascus reported, flatly denied the allegation. But nine months later, administration officials assert, the flow of arms had continued to Hezbollah.  According to a Pentagon official, Hezbollah’s arsenal now includes up to 50,000 rockets and missiles, including some 40 to 50 Fateh-110 missiles capable of reaching Tel Aviv and most of Israel, and 10 Scud-D missiles. The newly fortified Hezbollah has raised fears that any future conflict with Israel could erupt into a full-scale regional war. The Syrian episode offers a glimpse of the United States’ efforts to prevent buildups of arms — including Scud missiles, Soviet-era tanks and antiaircraft weapons — in some of the world’s tensest regions. Wielding surveillance photos and sales contracts, American diplomats have confronted foreign governments about shadowy front companies, secretive banks and shippers around the globe, according to secret State Department cables obtained byWikiLeaksand made available to several news organizations. American officials have tried to block a Serbian black marketer from selling sniper rifles to Yemen. They have sought to disrupt the sale of Chinese missile technology to Pakistan, the cables show, and questioned Indian officials about chemical industry exports that could be used to make poison gas. But while American officials can claim some successes — Russia appears to have deferred delivery of the S-300 air defense system toIran— the diplomats’ dispatches underscore how often their efforts have been frustrated in trying to choke off trade by Syria and others, including Iran andNorth Korea. The United States is the world’s largest arms supplier, and with Russia, dominates trade in the developing world. Its role as a purveyor of weapons to certain allies  —  including Israel, Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf states —  has drawn criticism that it has fueled an arms race. But it has also taken on a leading role as traffic cop in trying to halt deliveries of advanced weapons and other arms to militants and adversaries. According to the cables, American diplomats have repeatedly expressed concern that huge cargo planes operated by Badr Airlines of Sudan were flying weapons from Tehran to Khartoum, Sudan, where they were shipped toHamas, the militant group in Gaza. Sudan insisted that the cargo was farm equipment, but the United States asked countries in the region to deny overflight rights to the airlines. Jordan and several other countries agreed, but Yemen declined, a February 2009 cable reported. Egyptian officials, who view Iran with deep wariness, privately issued a threat. Omar Suleiman, the chief of Egypt’s intelligence service, told Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that Iran not only was providing $25 million a month to support Hamas but also was linked to a Hezbollah cell trying to smuggle arms from Gaza into Egypt, according to an April 2009 cable. “Egypt had sent a clear message to Iran that if they interfere in  Egypt, Egypt will interfere in Iran,” noted the cable, adding that the Egyptian official said his country had trained agents for that purpose. North Korea has abetted the arms race in the Middle East by providing missile technology to Iran and Syria, which then backed Hamas and Hezbollah, according to American intelligence officials and a cable from Mrs. Clinton.  The cables tell something of an international detective story: how North Korea’s arms industry has conducted many of its transactions through the Korea Mining and Development Corporation, relied on suppliers of machinery and steel from countries including Switzerland, Japan, China and Taiwan, passed money through Chinese and Hong Kong banks and sold weapons to other countries. To disrupt the transactions, American officials have prodded and protested. Diplomats raised questions in the spring of 2009, for example, about planned purchases from North Korea of rocket launchers by Sri Lanka and Scud missile launchers by Yemen. In July 2009, Stuart A. Levey, a senior United States Treasury official, warned a top official of the People’s Bank of China that “Chinese banks have been targeted by North Korea as the main access point into the international financial system,” according to one cable. And in meetings in Hong Kong that month, Mr. Levey complained that a local businessman was helping procure luxury goods for the North Korean leadership. (The Hong Kong banks later suggested that they had shut down the man’s accounts.) It is the arms transactions involving Syria and Hezbollah, however, that appear to be among the Obama administration’s gravest concerns. President Obama came into office pledging to engage with Syria, arguing that the Bush administration’s efforts to isolate Syria had done nothing to wean it from Iran or encourage Middle East peace efforts. Even before American diplomats began talks with the Assad government, Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, prodded Mr. Assad in a February 2009 meeting in Damascus to make a gesture that he could take back to the Obama administration as “an indicator of Assad’s good will.” Mr. Kerry told Mr. Assad that Mr. Obama   intended to withdraw American troops from Iraq “as soon as possible” and also hinted to a senior Syrian official that the Obama administration intended to take a firm line against the establishment of new Israeli settlements on the West Bank. “It is not our goal for the United States to be humiliated,” Mr. Assad said, referring to Iraq, according to a cable. In March 2009, a delegation of State Department and National Security Council officials traveled to Damascus for the first discussions, and in the next several months, each side made some modest gestures. The United States provided information “regarding a potential threat to a Syrian official” through Syria’s Washington ambassador and allowed a senior aide to George J. Mitchell, the American Middle East negotiator, to attend a  Syrian holiday event at the Syrian Embassy, a cable reported. Syria, for its part, allowed the Americans to reopen an English-language school and hosted a team of American military officials to discuss how to better regulate the Syria-Iraq border. Each side, however, wanted the other to take the first major initiative. Syria kept pressing for the lifting of economic sanctions, which had crippled its aviation industry, and the Americans urged Syria to curtail its support for Hezbollah and Hamas. “The U.S. had publicly recognized its mistakes, e.g. use of torture methods, and would continue to take steps,” Daniel B. Shapiro, a senior official on the National Security Council told the Syrians in the meeting, according to a May 2009 cable. “But others needed to reciprocate to ensure that the opportunity did not pass.” By the fall, however, officials at the American Embassy in Damascus appeared concerned that military developments were outpacing the incremental diplomacy. “Syria’s determined support of Hizballah’s military build-up, particularly the steady supply of longer-range rockets and the introduction of guided missiles could change the military balance and produce a scenario significantly more destructive than the July-August 2006 war,” said a November 2009 cable from the American chargé d’affaires in Damascus. According to cables, Syrian leaders appeared to believe that the weapons shipments increased their political leverage with the Israelis. But they made Lebanon even more of a tinderbox and increased the prospect that a future conflict might include Syria. A major worry was that Syria or Iran had provided Hezbollah with Fateh-110 missiles, with the range to strike Tel Aviv. (A United States government official said last week that the 40 to 50 missiles were viewed as especially threatening because they are highly accurate.) Israeli officials told American officials in November 2009 that if war broke out, they assumed that Hezbollah would try to launch 400 to 600 rockets at day and sustain the attacks for at least two months, the cables note. In February, the White House announced that a new American ambassador would be sent to Syria after a five-year hiatus. The next day, William J. Burns, a State Department under secretary, met with the Syrian leader. During the session, Mr. Burns repeated American concerns about weapons smuggling to Hezbollah, one dispatch noted. Mr. Assad replied that while he could not be Israel’s policeman, no “new” weapons were being sent to Hezbollah. Soon after the meeting, though, a cable noted that the Americans received intelligence reports that the Syrians were about to provide Hezbollah with Scud-D missiles, which are based on North Korean technology. (Some recent intelligence reports conclude that the group has about 10 such missiles stored in a Syrian warehouse that Hezbollah uses, according to American officials. The Defense Intelligence Agency believes that two have probably been moved to Lebanon, according to the officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity.) The United States officials also worried about Hezbollah’s vow to avenge the death of Imad Mughniyah, a senior fighter killed in a 2008 car bombing the militant group said was the work of the Israelis. In a classified cable in February, Mrs. Clinton directed the embassy to deliver a warning to Faisal al-Miqdad, the deputy foreign minister. “I know you are a strategic thinker, which is why I want to underscore for you that, from our perspective, your operational support for Hizballah is a strategic miscalculation that is damaging your long-term national interests.” The Syrian official’s response was dismissive, according to an American cable. He denied that any weapons had been sent, argued that Hezbollah would not take military action if not provoked and expressed surprise at the stern American protest. The complaint, he said, “shows the U.S. has not come to a mature position (that would enable it) to differentiate between its own interests and Israel’s.”

JOHANNESBURG In some ways, the World Cup crossed most of its ideological divides at Ellis Park Stadium when Brazil, the No. 1 soccer nation of the last 50 years, played North Korea, whose team has played at this level only twice in that span. Brazil, whose stars are the best and the wealthiest globetrotters in the sport, was facing soccer nobodies from a secretive land that rarely allows its citizens to travel abroad.0 It was the No. 1 team in the rankings of the world governing body, FIFA, against No. 105. But the Koreans made nonsense of this rating. What pride they exhibited. And how they made Brazil sweat to close out a 2-1 victory Tuesday in a stadium that once represented a divide in South Africa. Ellis Park used to be a stronghold of the white Afrikaans game, rugby union. South Africa has moved on. So should everyone, away from the notion that the isolation of half of the Korean Peninsula makes its citizens and players somehow inferior. Journalists were tersely reminded this week by the North Korean coach, Kim Jong-hun, that his country must be called the Democratic Republic of Korea. FIFA lists the team as the People’s Republic. To much of the world, it is simply North Korea. Such labels are obsolete when men are at play under the international laws of the game. South Korea is at this World Cup, too, and performing well. Yet the two Koreas remain separated by a narrow military zone, and their relations are sour. Under such circumstances, how can a FIFA ranking of 105 mean anything in relation to North Korea’s ability to play? If it seldom competes against the outside world, it cannot gain points to climb the ladder. But this week was a breakthrough of sorts. Koreans in the North were allowed to watch on television South Korea’s 2-0 victory over Greece. This is a far cry from 1988, when the Seoul Olympics took the world’s athletes to the South, but Pyongyang staged an alternative event at its own vast stadium. And then again in 2002, when South Korea and Japan co-hosted soccer’s World Cup and anyone was free to view it — except in North Korea. At both of those events, the ultimate sadness was that while millions of South Koreans thronged the streets to celebrate being at the center of world attention, their kinfolk in the North were left out. The man who built up South Korea’s soccer association, Chung Mong-joon, has risen to be a vice president of FIFA. His father fled communism, went south and founded Hyundai. Father and son were responsible, separately, for bringing the Olympics and then the World Cup to South Korea. So the difference between people from the same land is an imposed one. Soccer is one of the few things that can bridge the differences. There have even been exhibition matches between the northern and southern teams, always, of course, in South Korea and always heavily guarded. If this week achieves anything, it might be that people are less condescending toward athletes isolated by politics and ideology. If the North Korean camp is cut off from outside eyes, in contrast to Brazilians holding open training sessions to generate local support for the team, that cannot be the fault of the players. There are, inevitably, rumors that the guards are there more to keep the North’s players inside the camp than to keep outsiders out. But the exception — the approachable member of North Korea’s squad — is its striker, Jong Tae-se. Born in Japan, in an enclave where former Korean workers became part of the Japanese community, Jong enjoys the affluence and fame of a world-class soccer player, and the privilege of being allowed to come and go through Pyongyang more or less as he pleases. On Tuesday, two faces of Jong were displayed. As the anthem of North Korea played solemnly over Ellis Park, he stood in line, his face broken with emotion, openly weeping. Then the whistle blew, and Jong ran as if his liberty depended upon it. He chased, he harried and he got in as many shots on goal as any man on either side. In the end, however, Jong wasn’t blessed with a goal. Brazil’s Maicon was so blessed, however, scoring a magical one. Robinho created the second with a fabulous pass that played three opponents out of the game at a stroke. But the last word, the last goal, was also a fine one, and it came from the left foot of North Korea’s Ji Yun-nam. So the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea put on a display far more competitive than most people expected. That proved how little the world knows of sports history. In 1966, in the only other World Cup in which North Korea played, its team sensationally knocked out Italy, winning by 1-0 in the English city of Middlesbrough. The lesson then, as now, is that 11 men on any given day can shock 11 others who consider themselves superior. According to Jong, his comrades are remarkably “pure,” they live to play the game, and no amount of money could make them happier in their goal. This has been a remarkable opening, an opening perhaps of that shutter keeping out the world’s games. North and South Korea were drawn against each other in qualifying for this World Cup, and enmities arose over the playing of the anthems and raising of the flags, so much so that the second game between them, the designated home game for Pyongyang, was played in China. Their paths are unlikely to cross at this World Cup, but similarities can be seen in their spirit, their bodies, their pride. They are clearly brothers in different national uniforms.

As Brazil opens its World Cup campaign, Dunga, the team’s coach, has been criticized for shifts in the style of play.

JOHANNESBURG — Soccer in Brazil resembles figure skating in that artistry is no less important than performance. As Brazil opens its campaign for a sixth World Cup title here Tuesday against North Korea, the match features two coaches in jarring contrast. Dunga, 46, of Brazil is being raked by public criticism, while Kim Jong-hun, 53, of North Korea is being cocooned by FIFA, soccer’s world governing body. The coaches seem to have one thing in common, though — an impatience with prying reporters. In Brazil, the public frets that the national team’s once dazzling samba style has assumed a more martial beat. Dunga has been widely criticized for relying more on the imposing, muscular defense of a player like Lúcio, galloping counterattacks by right back Maicon, and the set-piece artistry of Dani Alves than the beautiful game of the days of Pelé. Brazil, along with Spain, is favored to win the tournament. But many Brazilians lament that victory would be achieved with insufficient elegance and flamboyance. Socrates, a star on the country’s 1982 World Cup team, recently said that Dunga’s style was “an affront to our culture.” Tostão, a forward on Brazil’s World Cup-winning team in 1970, wrote in a newspaper column that except for forward Robinho, “the Brazilian team today has very little individual inspiration.” Even Brazil’s president,Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, admonished Dunga for leaving a revived Ronaldinho, a two-time FIFA world player of the year and an ostentatious dribbler and passer, off the World Cup roster. It should be noted that neither Socrates’s 1982 team nor Ronaldinho’s 2006 team won the World Cup. In 2006, the so-called magic quartet of Ronaldinho, Ronaldo, Kaká and Adriano delivered only five goals in five matches. Brazil exited after a 1-0 quarterfinal defeat to France, managing to aim a single shot between the posts. So much for the beautiful game. Several weeks later, Carlos Caetano Bledorn Verri — better known as Dunga — was hired as Brazil’s national coach. The nickname, taken from Snow White and the seven dwarves, means Dopey in Portuguese. It was given by an uncle who thought that Dunga would never grow very tall. He did grow forceful enough as a defensive midfielder to captain Brazil to a World Cup title in 1994. But Dunga had no prior coaching experience at the elite level, and no enthusiasm for those who questioned his methods. This brush-cut, no-nonsense coach seemed to say that if fans wanted ostentation, let them go to Carnival. There are no sequins on a soccer uniform. “If we’re going to start up that debate again over playing pretty football,” Dunga said at the 2007 Copa América, which Brazil won over Argentina, “we’ll probably go another 24 years without winning the World Cup, which is what the others want. The Europeans will be having a party and we will be suffering.” Dunga has a point. Spain plays the beautiful game, sure, but it has never won a World Cup. Pragmatism must accompany splendor. Soccer has evolved from the days of Pelé. In the era of team defense, modern players are more fit and athletic, determined to close space immediately. As Bob Bradley, the United States coach, is fond of saying, “The window is small and it closes quickly.” Brazil did not look overly defensive when it took 31 shots against the Americans here in the final of the 2009 Confederations Cup, erasing a two-goal deficit in a frantic, wildly exciting 3-2 victory. There is a saying among sportsmen in Brazil that some people must be the piano players and some must be the piano carriers. In other words, players must be willing to sublimate personal glory to the group effort. Or, as Dunga puts it, his team needs “Brazilian talent and tactical care of the Europeans.” “We have scored more than 100 goals; we have to be somewhat creative,” Dunga said of his tenure on Monday. “We have only conceded 30 goals. We are a very balanced team.” If reporters want to criticize him for closing recent practices, he said, that is fine, just be respectful. “You attack me from morning to evening,” he told Brazilian reporters. “If I answer, you guys tell me I’m out of line.” And, “You criticize me for 24 hours; I can only criticize you for one second.” On this front, Kim of North Korea will no doubt have some sympathy. On Monday, a FIFA spokesman named Gordon Watson chided reporters not to ask questions of Kim related to politics. And he intervened any time a query came within a corner kick of being sensitive. Kim took care of the rest. When a reporter asked about North Korea’s fast, counterattacking style, Kim said brusquely that his country should be referred to only as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. When asked what he thought of South Korea’s opening victory over Greece, Kim did not answer. What about the apparent gaffe of listing forward Kim Myong-won as a goalkeeper, which means he can only play between the posts? Kim wanted to be a goalkeeper and this was a favor to him, his coach said. Kim Jong-hun did become animated in saying that North Korea’s famous victory over Italy in the 1966 World Cup had inspired him to become a coach. And he seems confident that another upset is possible against Brazil, even if North Korea is the lowest-ranked team in this tournament. “I think they don’t fall behind any other players in the world,” Kim said of his players. “Their talents will be shown if we win. This will bring great happiness to our Dear Leader, Kim Jong Il. It will also show the people of Democratic People’s Republic of Korea have a very strong mentality.” And that the people of Brazil have very queasy stomachs.
