SEOUL, South Korea  —North Koreaon Monday sentenced two American journalists to 12 years of hard labor  in a case widely seen as a test of how far the isolated Communist state was willing to take its confrontational stance toward the United States. The Central Court, the highest court of North Korea, held the trial  of  the two Americans,Laura LingandEuna Lee, from Thursday  to Monday and convicted them of “committing hostilities against the Korean nation and illegal entry,” the North’s official news agency, KCNA, said in a report  monitored in Seoul. Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee have been held  since they were detained by North Korean soldiers patrolling the border between China and North Korea on March 17. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has called the charges “baseless.” The United States government  had demanded that the North  forgo the legal proceedings and release the two women. The sentencing came amid rising tensions between Washington and Pyongyang. Earlier Monday, North Korea threatened to retaliate with “extreme” measures if the United Nations punished it for its  nuclear test last month, and  Washington warned that it might try to put the North  back on its list of states that sponsor terrorism, a designation that could subject the impoverished state to more financial sanctions. “Our response would be to  consider sanctions against us as a declaration of war and answer it with extreme hard-line measures,” the North Korea’s state-run newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, said in a commentary. Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee were on a reporting assignment from Current TV, a San Francisco-based media company co-founded by Al Gore, the former vice president, when they were detained by the soldiers. The reporters were working on a report about North Korean refugees — women and children — who had fled their homeland  in hopes of finding food in China. The circumstances surrounding their capture remain unclear. Analysts said they were  a pawn in a rapidly deteriorating confrontation between the United States and North Korea — a potential bargaining chip for the Pyongyang regime and a handicap for Washington in its efforts to pressure the government  over its recent missile and nuclear tests. The  sentence to North Korea’s infamous prison camps came despite repeated appeals for clemency from the journalists’ families. Defying not only its traditional foes — the United States, Japan and South Korea — but also its longtime ideological allies, China and Russia, North Korea launched an intermediate-range rocket on April 5 and conducted an underground nuclear test on May 25.

Obama needs to recognize that there is no longer any middle way in dealing with Pyongyang&#8217;s nuclear ambitions. The U.S. either has to accept the North as a nuclear power, or get tough.

The Obama administration has so far dealt publicly with the North Korean challenge in an understated, almost leisurely, manner. Emphasizing continued reliance on multilateral diplomacy, it has invited Pyongyang to return to the conference table, even while North Korea threatens military action and tests nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them  —     in the face of a declaration by all the major world powers that such actions are “unacceptable.” The challenge goes far beyond the regional security issue. For America, it involves relations with an emerging superpower (China); relations with a re-emerging Russia; relations with key U.S. allies (Japan and South Korea); and a major escalation in the threat of proliferation to non-state parties. The resumption of nuclear and missile testing by North Korea represents an abrupt reversal of a negotiating process that has been going, with only brief interruptions, for nearly two decades. Since 2004, six-party talks in Beijing included all the countries (North and South Korea, China, Russia, Japan and the United States) directly threatened by North Korean missiles and nuclear weapons. For a while, it was argued that bilateral negotiations between the United States and North Korea would prove more effective. That debate has become largely academic. Both approaches were pursued; both contributed to the stalemate inherited by the Obama administration. I favored negotiations with Pyongyang and have occasionally participated in Track II dialogue with Korean officials outside formal channels. But with North Korea kicking over all previous agreements repeatedly,  process has overwhelmed substance. The ultimate test of the Korean diplomacy always had to be the elimination of North Korea’s stockpile of fissionable material and nuclear weapons. But those were growing while the negotiations were proceeding at their stately pace. The negotiating process thereby ran the risk of legitimizing North Korea’s nuclear program by enabling Pyongyang to establish a fait accompli by means of diplomacy. That point is fast approaching if it has not already been reached. The incoming Obama administration gave North Korea every opportunity to accelerate the negotiating process. While on a visit to Beijing, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton hinted that she was seriously considering a visit to Pyongyang. Stephen Bosworth, a distinguished scholar and moderate diplomat, was appointed principal negotiator. These overtures were vituperatively rejected. Pyongyang used the change of American administration to signal a major shift in course. Bosworth was rebuffed while on a visit to the region. Refusing to return to the negotiating table, Pyongyang  also revoked all the concessions it had previously made. It has restarted its nuclear reprocessing plant and conducted another nuclear weapons test. Many explanations have been advanced for the brazenness of North Korean tactics, such as a domestic struggle for succession to the clearly ailing “Dear Leader” Kim Jong-il. But the only partially rational explanation is that North Korea’s leaders have recognized that no matter how conciliatory United States diplomacy, it would in the next phase demand the destruction of North Korea’s existing weapons capability. Pyongyang’s leaders have obviously decided to reject this outcome in the most absolute and confrontational manner. They must have concluded that no degree of political recognition could compensate for abandoning the signal (and probably sole) achievement of their rule, for which they have obliged their population to accept a form of oppression and exploitation unprecedented even in this period of totalitarianism.  They may well calculate that weathering a period of protest is their ticket to emerging as a de facto nuclear power. Hence the issue is no longer what forum should be used for negotiations but what their purpose is to be. The minimum precondition for a resumption of either of the existing forums would be that Pyongyang restore the previously implemented agreements that it has recently abrogated  —   especially the mothballing of the plutonium separation plant.  But that is not enough. However the next diplomatic phase is conducted, the United States needs to enter it with the recognition that there is no longer any middle ground between the abandonment of the North Korean program and the status quo. Any policy that does not do away with North Korea’s nuclear military capability, in effect, acquiesces in its continuation. A program of marginal additional sanctions followed by another protracted period of give-and-take would have that practical consequence. The North Korean challenge thus confronts the administration with two basic options: To accept tacitly or openly that the North Korean nuclear program is beyond the point where it can be reversed and to seek to cap it and proscribe any proliferating activities beyond North Korea’s borders; To attempt to end the North Korean nuclear program by a maximum deployment of pressures, which requires the active participation of Korea’s neighbors, especially China. Acceptance of the North Korean nuclear program would fly in the face of American foreign policy since we shepherded the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty through the international community in 1967, as well as of the policy put forward by President Obama only two months ago in a seminal speech in Prague. Acquiescence in a North Korean nuclear program would undermine prospects of the proposed negotiations with Iran. If the North Korean methods practiced during the Korean negotiations become a model for negotiations on Mideast nuclear programs, a chaotic world will beckon. De facto acquiescence in a North Korean nuclear program would require a reconsideration of current U.S. strategic planning. More emphasis would need to be given to missile defense. It would be essential to redesign the American deterrent strategy in a world of multiple nuclear powers  —   a challenge unprecedented in our experience. The enhanced role of non-state actors with respect to terrorism would have to be addressed. A new argument in favor of acquiescence in North Korea’s nuclear program has recently made its appearance. It contends that Pyongyang’s conduct is really a hidden cry for assistance against Chinese domination and thus deserves support rather than opprobrium.  But turning North Korea into a ward of the United States is neither feasible nor acceptable to the countries whose support for a solution of the North Korean nuclear issue is imperative. No long-term solution of the Korean nuclear problem is sustainable without the key players of Northeast Asia, and that means China, South Korea, the United States and Japan, with an important role for Russia as well. A wise diplomacy will move urgently to assemble the incentives and pressures to bring about the elimination of nuclear weapons and stockpiles from North Korea. It is not enough to demand unstated pressures from other affected countries, especially China. A concept for the political evolution of Northeast Asia is urgently needed. Too much of the commentary on the current crisis has concerned the deus ex machina of Chinese pressures on North Korea and complaints that Beijing has not implemented its full arsenal of possibilities. But for China, the issue is not so much a negotiating position as concern about its consequences. If the Pyongyang regime is destabilized, the future of Northeast Asia would then have to be settled by deeply concerned parties amidst a fast-moving crisis. They need to know the American attitude and clarify their own for that contingency. China faces challenges perhaps even more complex than America’s. If present trends continue, and if North Korea manages to maintain its nuclear capability through the inability of the parties to bring matters to a head, the proliferation of nuclear weapons throughout Northeast Asia and the Middle East becomes probable. China will then face the prospect of nuclear weapons in all surrounding Asian states and an unmanageable nuclear-armed regime in Pyongyang. But if China exercises the full panoply of its pressures without an accord with America and an understanding with the other parties, it has reason to fear chaos along its borders at or close to the traditional invasion routes of China. A sensitive, thoughtful dialogue with China, rather than peremptory demands, is essential. The outcome of such a dialogue is difficult to predict, but it cannot be managed unless America clarifies its own purposes to itself. Some public statements imply the U.S. will try to deal with specific North Korean threats rather than eliminate the capability to carry them out. They leave open with what determination Washington will pursue the elimination of the existing stockpile of North Korean nuclear weapons and fissionable materials. It is not possible to undertake both courses simultaneously. The ultimate issue is not regional but concerns the prospects for world order, especially for a Pacific political structure along the lines of that put forward by the thoughtful Australian prime minister, Kevin Rudd. There could scarcely seem to be an issue more suited to cooperation among the Great Powers than non-proliferation, especially with regard to North Korea, a regime run by fanatics, located on the borders of China, Russia and South Korea, and within missile range of Japan. Still, the major countries have been unable to galvanize themselves into action. In this multipolar world, many issues like nuclear proliferation, energy and climate change require a concert approach. The major powers of the 21st century have proved to be heterogeneous and without much experience as part of a concert of powers.  Connecting their purposes, however, needs to be their ultimate task if the world is to avoid the catastrophe of unchecked proliferation.

SINGAPORE — Defense SecretaryRobert M. Gatesraised the idea of a tougher approach towardNorth Korea’s recent nuclear test in meetings here with Asian allies on Saturday, including the prospect of building up United States military forces in the region should six-nation diplomatic talks with North Korea fail, American defense officials said. Mr. Gates raised “the notion that we should think about this as we are pursuing the six-party talks,” said a senior defense official who asked for anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue. “We ought to think about what more we need to do should they not prove successful.” But another defense official cautioned that talk of any military buildup was premature and that it was merely a “prudent option” in terms of “what should we be thinking about in the event that we need to start enhancing our posture, our defenses?” On Friday Mr. Gates said that the United States had no plans to reinforce some 28,000 American troops based in South Korea. Mr. Gates, who warned North Korea in a speech here early Saturday that the United States would not tolerate it becoming a nuclear-armed nation, met throughout the day at the conference, called the Shangri-La Dialogue, with defense officials from China, South Korea, Japan and other Asian nations to begin pulling together a consensus on how to proceed. James B. Steinberg, the deputy secretary of State, attended a number of meetings, as did Dennis C. Blair, the director of national intelligence. There was widespread acknowledgement that sanctions against North Korea had to be strengthened because of its nuclear test on Monday and subsequent firings of short-range missiles. There was also general agreement that the long-running six-nation talks aimed at getting North Korea to give up its nuclear program had so far failed. But by Sunday morning, Asian defense officials had not endorsed a specific course of action. “There’s no prescription yet on what to do,” said one of the senior American defense officials. Late in the day on Saturday, Mr. Gates had a meeting focused on North Korea with the defense ministers of South Korea and Japan, a precursor to more detailed discussions to occur next week about North Korea’s nuclear test. Mr. Steinberg is to lead the American team at those meetings; the group will include Stuart Levey, the Treasury under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, an indication that economic measures will be a significant part of the discussions. Mr. Gates met on Saturday with the highest-ranking Chinese official at the conference, Lt. Gen. Ma Xiaotian, the deputy chief of the general staff of the People’s Liberation Army. American defense officials said after the meeting that China, which has been reluctant to take tough action against North Korea, clearly viewed the nuclear test seriously.

North Korea’s nuclear test drew protests and threats to punish the regime in Pyongyang with tighter sanctions.

PARIS — Across the globe from Washington to Moscow to Beijing,North Korea’s underground nuclear test drew condemnation and criticism on Monday and some governments  threatened  to press for tighter sanctions at the United Nations Security Council. But given the patchy record of sanctions on North Korea, it remained unclear what effect such threats might yield. Prime Minister Taro Aso of Japan said his government would seek a new United Nations resolution to condemn the test. He said an urgent meeting of the Security Council was expected to be held on Monday in New York at Japan’s request. China, whose response was closely watched around the world, said it was “resolutely opposed” to the test, according to a  Foreign Ministry  statement carried by the official Xinhua news agency. China is by far North Korea’s largest trading partner and wields critical diplomatic influence. Russia said the test breached a United Nations Security Council resolution and would “endanger security and stability in the region,” according to the Russian Foreign Ministry in a statement. President Obama was among the first to register protest, saying in a statement that “North Korea is directly and recklessly challenging the international community.” The statement continued: “Such provocations will only serve to deepen North Korea’s isolation. It will not find international acceptance unless it abandons its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.” Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he believed the latest series of tests “just speak to the growing belligerence on the part of North Korea,” The Associated Press reported. Appearing on NBC’s “Today” show on Monday, Admiral Mullen said described North Korea as a country that “continues to destabilize that region and in the long term should they continue to develop anuclear weaponsprogram, poses a grave threat to the United States.” European governments joined the call for Security Council action and said North Korea would not gain international acceptance as long as it followed policies that Prime Minister Gordon Brown ofBritaindescribed as “erroneous, misguided and a danger to the world.” The French Foreign Ministry said in a statement: “France will consult in the coming hours with its partners on the Security Council and in the region on the consequences to draw from this serious act by North Korea, and in particular on strengthening sanctions.” Germany also condemned the test. Several European foreign ministers were heading for a meeting in Hanoi with their Asian counterparts when news of the test broke. Carl Bildt, Sweden’s minister of foreign affairs, called the development “alarming.” Javier Solana, the foreign policy chief of the European Union, said in Brussels that the “irresponsible acts by North Korea warrant a firm response.” After the North’s first nuclear test in October 2006, a United Nations Security Council resolution, drafted by the United States, banned trade with North Korea in materials linked with unconventional weapons, and authorized countries to inspect cargo going into and out of the North. It also sought to outlaw international travel and freeze the overseas assets of people associated with the North’s weapons programs. But doubts about the sanctions arose when South Korea and China indicated that business and economic relations would be largely unaffected. In April 2009, North Korea defied the United States, China and a series of United Nations resolutions by launching a rocket that the country said was designed to propel a satellite into space. Much of the world viewed the test as an effort to prove it is edging toward the capability to shoot a nuclear warhead on a longer-range missile. Following the launch, the Security Council decided unanimously last month to tighten sanctions against North Korea. The White House asked the United Nations sanctions committee to develop a list of North Korean companies to be singled out, focusing on companies involved in missile and nuclear technology. But some analysts said they doubted that these measures would prove effective. They noted that China opposed a stronger United Nations response to the April missile launching. On the Korean peninsula on Monday , news of the test caused an initial drop on South Korean markets, where the benchmark Kospi index plummeted by up to 6.3 per cent before recovering almost all of its losses. The won fell against the dollar but also recovered. The government in Seoul called the North Korean underground test a “direct threat against the peace and stability in the region as well as to the world.” Australia offered “absolute condemnation” and New Zealand expressed worries about the test, as did India. “India is against nuclear proliferation,” India’s Defense Minister A.K. Antony said in New Delhi, The A.P. reported. “It’s a matter of very serious concern not only to India, but to the world.”

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreahas told international aviation and maritime authorities that it will launch a satellite in early April,  the North’s official news agency  and a news agency in  the  South reported  on Thursday. North Korea’s neighbors and Western nations believe the launching is actually cover for testing a long-range missile  capable of reaching the American mainland. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has  said such a  launching would be “very unhelpful.” The North’s state-run Korea Central News Agency said the country notified the international organizations to “ensure the safety of flights and sea vessels.” It did not disclose a date. But  South Korea’s  Yonhap news agency, quoting unidentified  government sources, said the North had told the international organizations that the launching would be between April 4 and 8.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreahas been moving what appear to be components of a long-range missile to a launching site, a South Korean official and news reports said Tuesday, raising fears that it might test-fire a missile. The North Korean move, first reported by the South Korean news agency Yonhap and the Japanese newspaper Sankei Shimbun, came amid concern among political analysts in Seoul, South Korea’s capital, that the North might also try some sort of military provocation to help make its nuclear program a foreign policy priority for the Obama administration. North Korea has launched missiles in the past to win political or economic concessions. In recent weeks, it has said that its military had assumed an “all-out confrontational posture” and that it had scrapped all nonaggression pacts with South Korea. In Washington, a State Department spokesman, Robert A. Wood, said he could not comment on the reports, calling them “an intelligence matter.” But he added: “North Korea’s missile activities and missile programs are of concern to the region. A ballistic missile launch by North Korea would be unhelpful and, frankly, provocative.” Recent spy satellite images showed a train carrying a long, cylindrical object, believed to be a missile, heading to a new launching site on North Korea’s western coast, Yonhap reported, quoting an unidentified government official. But in another dispatch late Tuesday, Yonhap said that intelligence officials were still tracking the train and that there was a possibility that the North would take it to another launching site. A South Korean government official reached Tuesday confirmed the train’s movement, as cited by Yonhap. “We detected such a movement in the last week of January,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue with reporters. The object is believed to be a Taepodong-2 missile, Yonhap said. The missile is designed to fly at least 4,200 miles, far enough to reach North America, and carry a payload of 1,400 to 2,200 pounds, according to the South Korean Defense Ministry. North Korea test-fired the missile in July 2006. But it was considered a failure, with its rocket fizzling out shortly after it blasted off. While not ruling out the possibility of a missile test, analysts and officials in Seoul  said that the North often “puts on a show” at its military facilities to stir up uncertainty among its neighbors.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge has awarded more than $65 million to several men of the Navy spy ship Pueblo, who were captured and tortured byNorth Koreain 1968. The judge, Henry H. Kennedy Jr. of Federal District Court, issued the judgment against North Korea on Tuesday. North Korea did not respond to the lawsuit, which accused it of kidnapping, imprisonment and torture. Four former crewmen of the Pueblo filed the suit in 2006. The Pueblo was seized off North Korea on Jan. 23, 1968, while it was on an intelligence-gathering mission. North Korea says the ship was inside its coastal zone. Navy records say it was in international waters. One crew member was killed in the attack, and 10 were wounded. The crewmen were held captive for 11 months.

North Korea on Sunday welcomed the move and said that it would resume disabling its nuclear weapons facilities.

WASHINGTON — The Bush administration announced Saturday that it had removedNorth Koreafrom a list of state sponsors of terrorism in a bid to salvage a fragile nuclear deal that seemed on the verge of collapse. Sean McCormack, the State Department spokesman, said that the United States made the decision after North Korea agreed to resume disabling a plutonium plant and to allow some inspections to verify that it had halted its nuclear program as promised months earlier. The deal, which the Bush administration had portrayed as a major foreign policy achievement, began slipping away in recent weeks in a dispute over the verification program. Just days ago, North Korea barred international inspectors from the plant. The decision to remove North Korea from the terror list was a dramatic moment for President Bush, who had called the country part of an “axis of evil” and had only reluctantly ordered administration officials to engage in negotiations, saying that the United States had made deals with the nation’s leaders before without winning enough concessions. That calculus changed in 2006, when North Korea exploded a nuclear device. But Mr. Bush is already having trouble selling the new agreement to his own party. Republican lawmakers, including the presidential nominee, Senator John McCain, quickly expressed concern, complaining that North Korea had yet to demonstrate that it was serious about adhering to its commitment to denuclearize. Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee for president, called the deal “a modest step forward” in dismantlingNorth Korea’s nuclear weaponsprogram. Other Democrats said they welcomed the agreement but noted that it did not go much beyond an agreement President Clinton reached with North Korea in 1994, which the Bush administration, including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, criticized as inadequate. Bush administration officials, trying to head off potential criticism that they were simply seeking a foreign policy victory in their last months, said the agreement was the best the United States could get at this time. Ms. Rice “very strongly feels that it is our own responsibility, until Jan. 20, 2009, to act as good stewards of the national interest,” Mr. McCormack said during a news conference. In the most significant part of the accord announced Saturday, North Korea agreed to a verification plan that would allow United States inspectors access to its main declared nuclear compound, at Yongbyon; international inspectors have worked at the site on and off for years. But the deal puts off decisions on the thorniest verification issue: what would happen if international experts suspected the North was hiding other nuclear weapons facilities, particularly those related to uranium enrichment. The United States wanted the North to agree to inspections at sites that raised suspicions, but North Korea balked. The new agreement calls for United States inspectors to be granted access to such sites “based on mutual consent” with North Korea. Experts on North Korea say that the concession by the United States was probably necessary to achieve a deal, but that it no doubt will lead to future fights, since the North’s leaders will not want to give inspectors free rein to travel the country. Patricia A. McNerney, one of the State Department negotiators, acknowledged that issue would probably lead to a hornets’ nest of problems. “Going into verification with North Korea will not be easy, we know that,” she said. “This is the most secret and opaque regime in the world.” North Korea on Sunday welcomed its removal from Washington's terrorism blacklist and said that it would resume disabling its nuclear weapons facilities, allowing American and United Nations monitors back into its main nuclear complex. South Korea and Japan also hailed the agreement on Sunday. But hawkish politicians in Washington's two main Asian allies, as well as relatives of people allegedly kidnapped by the Communist state, accused the United States of giving in to the North's bad behavior. "We are extremely disappointed with the United States, which we had believed would be a pillar of anti-terrorism and human rights," said Choi Sung Yong, 56, head of the Abductees' Family Union, which includes relatives of hundreds of South Koreans, mostly fishermen, allegedly abducted to the North. Relatives of the South Korean and Japanese abductees have counted on Bush to use the terrorism blacklist as leverage to pressure the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, to return their missing family members. North Korea, which has long sought international acceptance, had been pushing hard to get off the terror list. But Mr. McCormack made clear on Saturday that North Korea is still subject to numerous economic sanctions. The agreement follows weeks of intense negotiations and high-stakes brinkmanship, as North Korea, furious that the Bush administration had not removed it from the terrorism list as it agreed last summer, threatened to restart its plutonium-based weapons program and barred international inspectors from the Yongbyon plant. In Washington, State Department proponents of the deal, including Ms. Rice and her top North Korea envoy, Christopher R. Hill, battled critics inside and outside the administration who castigated them for trying to salvage the accord. The administration has been at war with itself over whether to go ahead with the North Korea pact despite objections from critics in the office of Vice President Dick Cheney, and even some members of the State Department’s verification and compliance office. That rift spilled into the open at the news conference on Saturday, when a reporter asked Paula A. DeSutter, the assistant secretary of state for verification, compliance and implementation, how she responded to criticism of the deal from John R. Bolton, her former boss at the State Department. Ms. DeSutter did not defend the accord, saying simply, “John is the epitome of a skeptical policymaker, and that’s appropriate.” Despite the internal fights, Ms. Rice convinced President Bush last week that this was the best the administration could get in its remaining time in office. But as late as Friday, things remained up in the air, said one administration official, who, like several other officials and diplomats interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the issue. Another senior administration official described the internal deliberations as a “close call.” Senator McCain said in a statement that he would not support the deal until he got some questions answered. “I expect the administration to explain exactly how this new verification agreement advances American interests and those of our allies,” he said. He added that he was “concerned that this latest agreement appears to have been reached between Washington and Pyongyang, and only then discussed with our Asian allies in an effort to garner their support.” Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Republican of Florida, issued a statement strongly criticizing the deal. “I am profoundly disappointed,” she said. “By rewarding North Korea before the regime has carried out its commitments, we are encouraging this regime to continue its illicit nuclear program and violate its pledge to no longer provide nuclear assistance to extremist regimes.” Two of the Bush administration’s main criticisms of the 1994 accord were that it did not mandate the removal of nuclear material from North Korea and that international inspectors were limited to  Yongbyon. The 1994 accord collapsed in 2002 after the Bush administration accused North Korea of circumventing the agreement by pursuing a second path to a bomb, based on enriching uranium. The White House said at the time that it would require full verification that any uranium program had been halted, though later the intelligence community expressed some doubts about how far the program had gotten. Although the new agreement leaves open the possibility of future inspections outside Yongbyon, it leaves vague what mechanism would be used to determine the status of a uranium program. The North has agreed in principle to give up its nuclear material and any weapons, but that seems almost certain to be subject to negotiations with the next president. During the Bush administration, North Korea is believed to have produced enough bomb-grade plutonium for six or more nuclear weapons. Bush administration officials have been consulting about the latest deal with its partners in the so-called “six-party” talks, the group including Russia, South Korea and Japan that negotiated the agreement in 2007 for the North to halt its nuclear activities. Diplomats said that Japan had expressed reservations about removing North Korea from the terror list because the North still had not addressed all of their concerns about abductions of Japanese citizens decades ago. After the official announcement on Saturday, Japan’s finance minister, Shoichi Nakagawa, called the American decision “extremely regrettable.” South Korea has been more supportive. “We welcome the agreement because we believe this will help put the six-party negotiations back on track and eventually lead to the dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear programs,” said Kim Sook, South Korea’s main nuclear envoy, during a news conference in Seoul on Sunday. The South Korean foreign minister, Yu Myung-hwan, had stressed Friday that if the six-party negotiations fell apart now, the next administration would have difficulty restarting them. Gary Samore, a nonproliferation expert in the Clinton administration, characterized the deal as probably the best that could be gotten at this time, but warned of stormy times to come. “Every agreement you ever have with the North Koreans always contains certain ambiguities, and that ends up being the basis for which you have the next round of talks,” he said. “It’s always two steps forward and one step back.” For instance, he said, besides the issue of access to suspected nuclear sites, the United States and North Korea appear to have fudged the critical issue of whether American inspectors will be allowed to take all the samples they want out of the country to foreign laboratories for inspection. According to a fact sheet issued by the Bush administration, the two sides agreed “on the use of scientific procedures, including sampling and forensic activities,” although the sheet doesn’t say where those tests would be done. Mr. Bolton, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations under Mr. Bush, said that the Bush administration had “punted” the hardest issue, that of inspections beyond declared nuclear sites. “This means that North Korea has a veto over everything beyond Yongbyon,” he said, “so that’s a clear victory for North Korea.”

The Bush administration is dispatching Christopher Hill to Pyongyang in a last-ditch effort to rescue an accord leading to the country’s nuclear disarmament.

WASHINGTON  — The Bush administration is dispatching its chiefNorth Koreanegotiator, Christopher Hill, to Pyongyang this week in a last-ditch effort to rescue what the White House had hoped would be a singular foreign policy achievement: an accord leading to the country’s nuclear disarmament. The rapid decision to send Mr. Hill to the North Korean capital, days after North Korea broke the seals thatUnited Nationsinspectors placed on its equipment and said it was restarting a facility to manufacture bomb-grade plutonium, seemed to underscore the administration’s desperation to restore an accord that took most of President Bush’s second term to negotiate and implement. Mr. Hill, one administration official said, is “flying blind,” hoping to get a previous agreement back on track. The fact that Mr. Hill is going to Pyongyang at all shows how much has changed in the administration. In his first term. Mr. Bush refused to talk to the country, and American strategy was to hasten North Korea’s economic collapse. But the country refused to buckle, and sped ahead with its nuclear enrichment facility. In more recent years, the administration argued for months about whether to allow Mr. Hill to participate in direct talks with the North Koreans, particularly in Pyongyang. His efforts to go there were repeatedly blocked by hard-liners who argued that to show up in North Korea would be to reward the government there. But if there were any such arguments this time, they appear to have been brief. The United States must decide in the next month or two whether to continue sending oil shipments to North Korea; before it cuts them off, officials say, Mr. Hill wanted to make a direct appeal to the North Korean leadership. But it is not clear who is controlling the country, after reports PresidentKim Jong-ilsuffered a stroke.

To the Editor: Re “North Koreans Welcome Symphonic Diplomacy” (news article, Feb. 27): Much as I welcome the New York Philharmonic’s role in peacemaking, if a family memory serves as precedent, it may be some time before the orchestra’s visit to North Korea has any positive effect. In 1956, my father, Leonard Burkat, who was at that time the music administrator of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, traveled with the orchestra to the Soviet Union, where it played before the country’s leaders and on radio and television. The tour was underwritten in part by the United States State Department and was said to be the first visit by an American orchestra to the Soviet Union after World War II. Its goal was clear: to help that country and the United States break down the large barriers that separated them. Unfortunately, it took 35 more years and the end of Communist rule to really make that happen. Howard BurkatHastings-on-Hudson, Feb. 27, 2008  To the Editor: The White House dismissed the significance of the New York Philharmonic’s concert in Pyongyang as neither hurting nor helping our diplomatic efforts in North Korea. The emotional outpouring of appreciation by people weaned on anti-Americanism for decades points in a different direction. The concert was not the “axis of evil” threat of a bully, but the face and voice of the American people. If a concert in Pyongyang, why not in Tehran? Why not in Havana? The objection that such events tend to legitimize the host government is absurd. Donald E. SmithWayne, Pa., Feb. 27, 2008  To the Editor: As a native New Yorker, I find it embarrassing to see one of the city’s most prestigious institutions act so naïvely and without regard to the millions who have been abused, jailed, tortured and executed by the dictatorships of Kim Jong-il and his father, Kim Il-sung. Aren’t we New Yorkers supposed to be a street-smart bunch, progressive and concerned with those less fortunate around the world? Instead, the members of the New York Philharmonic played for well-off party dignitaries, while the real North Korean population is starving and living in sections of the Korean Peninsula that many foreign observers have described as almost prison camps. During the 1980s, many artists and performers rightly refused to interact with apartheid South Africa. It’s hypocritical to now see no problem with a cultural exchange with one of the most repressive dictatorships in the world. Mario RamirezWantagh, N.Y., Feb. 27, 2008

The president wrote a letter to Kim Jong-il, his first direct communication with the reclusive North Korean dictator.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 — President Bush, directly engaging the man he publicly called a “tyrant,” wrote a letter toNorth Korea’s leader,Kim Jong-il, in which he held out the prospect of normalized relations with the United States if North Korea fully disclosed its nuclear programs and dismantled its nuclear reactor, administration officials said Thursday. The high-level personal missive from Mr. Bush to the leader of the country he placed in his “axis of evil” in 2002 was sent as American negotiators  struggle to get the secretive North Korean government to fully explain and disclose the extent, use and spread of its nuclear material and technology. At the same time, the United States is also urging other nations to maintain pressure on Iran in the wake of a new assessment that Tehran halted nuclear weapons work in 2003. Mr. Bush addressed the letter  “Dear Mr. Chairman,” and urged the enigmatic North Korean leader to disclose all of his country’s past and present nuclear work. “I want to emphasize that the declaration must be complete and accurate if we are to continue our progress,” the letter said, according to a senior administration official. The letter closed, “Sincerely,George W. Bush.” It was signed by hand, administration officials said. While administration officials described the letter as straightforward, its very existence underscores just how much the White House wants to ensure that one of the administration’s scarce, tangible diplomatic accomplishments does not slip away. North Korea agreed in October to dismantle all of its nuclear facilities and to disclose all of its past and present nuclear programs by the end of the year in return for about a million tons  of fuel oil or its equivalent in economic aid. That agreement has come under fierce criticism from national security hawks, but many foreign policy experts point to it as a rare diplomatic success in a period that has been dominated by frustration in Iran, the Middle East and Pakistan. The White House declined to provide copies of the letter and sought to minimize its significance by pointing out that Mr. Bush had written letters to the leaders of all the other countries in the so-called six-party group that had been working to end North Korea’s nuclear program. “In these letters, the president reiterated our commitment to the six-party talks and stressed the need for North Korea to come forward with a full and complete declaration of their nuclear programs, as called for in the September 2005 six-party agreement,” said Gordon D. Johndroe, a White House spokesman. But Mr. Bush talks to the leaders of the other countries — China, Russia, Japan and South Korea — on a regular basis. And the letters were not identical, administration officials said. “The letter to Kim Jong-il speaks of the six-party process and its historical mission, and lays out a vision of normalization and complete denuclearization,” a senior administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment on the letters publicly. “They are all different.” Another administration official said the letter emphasized the need to resolve three sticking points: the number of warheads North Korea built, the amount of weapons-grade nuclear material it produced and the need for North Korea to disclose what nuclear material and knowledge it has received from other countries and what nuclear material and knowledge it has passed on to other countries. The proliferation issue has taken on new importance since an Israeli strike in Syria in September, which administration and Israeli officials say was conducted against a nuclear plant near the Euphrates River that was supplied with material from North Korea. Administration officials want North Korea to disclose what help it may have given Syria, although they also acknowledge that any such assistance occurred before North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear reactor and disclose its nuclear programs. Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice indicated on Thursday that Dec. 31 was not a hard and fast deadline for the disclosure, and that it could slip a few days or even weeks. The letter to Mr. Kim is dated Dec. 1, administration officials said. Mr. Hill delivered it to his North Korean counterpart in Beijing on Wednesday. Within hours, North Korea announced that Mr. Kim had received the letter. The White House letter is a huge reversal from the veritable cold war that has existed between Mr. Bush and Mr. Kim for most of the Bush administration. In 2002, Mr. Bush referred to Mr. Kim as a “pygmy” and compared him to a “spoiled child at a dinner table” during a meeting with Republican senators, according to news reports at the time. In his State of the Union address that same year, Mr. Bush called Mr. Kim’s government “a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction, while starving its citizens.” During a news conference in 2005, Mr. Bush called Mr. Kim a “tyrant” and said he maintained “concentration camps.” The letter struck a more cordial tone. “I would describe it as a presidential letter to another leader of a country,” said Dana Perino, the White House press secretary. Mr. Hill, who was recently in North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang, and was in Beijing on Wednesday for meetings with some of his counterparts in the talks, has advised the North to make a full disclosure of its nuclear programs, as it agreed to in October. North Korea seemed to be on the verge of making a limited disclosure, perhaps as a negotiating ploy before Dec. 31, the tentative deadline, administration officials said. Administration officials are walking something of a tightrope between pressing hard for the declaration and compromising with North Korean negotiators to get one and declare victory. Several senior officials said they were mindful of criticism from national security hawks in Washington, who do not want to see a deal go through because they do not believe that North Korea will abide by it. “This is like Lucy and Charlie Brown and the football,” said John R. Bolton, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations. “How many times are we going to go through this with them?”

The deputy chief of the U.N. Development Program said the American accusations far surpassed what the program had at its disposal.

UNITED NATIONS, June 28 — The deputy chief of the United Nations Development Program has shot back at American accusations that it had squandered millions of dollars inNorth Korea, saying the amount far surpassed what the program had at its disposal and questioning the authenticity of documents the American mission provided to back up its claims. In a confidential letter delivered Thursday evening to Zalmay Khalilzad, the United States ambassador, the official, Ad Melkert, said the money amounts, vendor names and transaction dates supplied by the United States had been examined against his agency’s records and “there is not a single match.” He said the volume of payments that the Americans claimed that the program had made to North Korean government entities was “significantly higher” than the total that the office had for all purposes in the country. American officials have said their charges stem from internal business records of the program, but Mr. Melkert challenged the veracity of seven supporting documents that the United States mission supplied in a June 15 meeting. Those were presented as being files from 2001 and 2002, but he said his office had determined that they had been generated under a computer coding system put into effect in 2004. The documents, he said, “show U.N.D.P. corporate system codes not in use by U.N.D.P. in those years.” Noting that the United States had termed the evidence made available so far “sample documents,” Mr. Melkert asked Mr. Khalilzad to furnish all of the documentation substantiating the American claims. The letter is the latest in a series of frosty exchanges between Mr. Melkert and American officials in the six months since Mark D. Wallace, the deputy American ambassador for management, accused the program of serving as “a steady and large source of hard currency” for the North Korean government. The program, Mr. Wallace wrote then, has been “systematically perverted for the benefit of the Kim Jong-il regime rather than the people of North Korea,” and he suggested that the United Nations money might have ended up financing North Korea’s nuclear program. The new letter was made available by an official interested in combating the wide attention that the American allegations had received through briefings by Mr. Wallace for selected news outlets, editorial writers, members of Congress and nations that finance the development program. A note sent to participants in a briefing by Mr. Wallace before a subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on May 23 promised “many parallels to the oil-for-food scandal” and evidence of “a direct link between U.N. assistance and the North Korean missile programs.” Mr. Melkert complained in a previous letter that the briefings failed to mention the rebuttals supplied by his office to each set of allegations. Asked Thursday afternoon about the months of charge and countercharge, Mr. Wallace noted that Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and Kemal Dervis, the development program’s chief, had committed themselves to look into the matter. “I think the U.S. certainly looks forward to the U.N.D.P.’s constructive and technical inquiry into the program, a program that appears to have lost its way,” he said. The original January accusation from Mr. Wallace prompted the development program’s executive board that same month to order an end to the practice of furnishing payments in hard currency to the North Korean government and to making in-country hiring subject to government approval. In March, after North Korea resisted those conditions, the agency announced that it was suspending operations in the country, curtailing 20 programs with an overall budget of $4.4 million. The programs dealt with agricultural recovery and rural energy development, according to the development program’s Web site. On June 1 a preliminary United Nations audit offered no support for the charge that systematic large-scale diversions to the North Korean government had occurred, but it said the program had broken its own rules by hiring workers selected by the government and paying them in foreign currency. Then the United States raised a series of new charges, and program officials responded to each point. To Mr. Wallace’s charge that the program had transferred $7 million to its counterpart agency in the North Korean government, the program said that the amount actually had been $175,000 and that most of it had gone for  workshops on vegetable growing and seed processing. The program reiterated the same $175,000 figure in reply to a second allegation: that an additional $2.8 million in program money had gone to North Korean missions in New York and Europe and had been used to purchase buildings and houses in Britain, France and Canada. The agency also turned aside Mr. Wallace’s accusations that it had procured equipment for North Korea that could be put to military use. It said the equipment, which included global positioning systems, personal computers and a portable spectrometer, an optical device, had been purchased under a program, common in developing nations, that monitors natural disasters and helps to estimate crop yields. Mr. Melkert also denied that his agency had paid $2.7 million to the Zang Lok Trading Company, a banking institution based in Macao that Mr. Wallace said was linked to a North Korean financial agent involved in weapons sales. According to banking records, Mr. Melkert said, the development program’s total payments to Zang Lok from 1999 to the present amount to $52,201.95 and went for workshop equipment and computers for Unesco, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and for the World Intellectual Property Organization. The development program had no transactions with Zang Lok on its own account, he said. Totaling up the charges, Mr. Melkert said in his letter to Mr. Khalilzad that “the allegation that U.N.D.P. transferred $15 million in cash to the D.P.R.K. government in the period 2001-2005  is not supported as our banking records show that the country office did not have this magnitude of resources at its disposal.” North Korea’s official name is the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Mr. Melkert said that only an average of $2.5 million a year had been available from 2001 to 2005 and that the sum included all payments made by the country office supporting development program operations and some other United Nations functions. Mr. Wallace has also cited “eyewitness accounts” from unidentified people to support his charges, and he has accused the program of retaliating against one of its employees for revealing information about mismanagement. In a letter Tuesday to the secretary general, Senator Norm Coleman, a Minnesota Republican, identified the employee as Artjon Shkurtaj, the program’s chief of operations in North Korea in 2005 and 2006. David Morrison, the program’s spokesman, said Mr. Shkurtaj left North Korea in August 2006 and left the program in March 2007, after fulfilling several short-term contracts. Senator Coleman said he had been let go because of concerns he had raised and should be afforded whistle-blower protection. Mr. Melkert said Mr. Shkurtaj had been invited to submit his information to the program’s audit office but had declined to do so.

North Koreahas test-fired “several missiles,” the United States said, as United Nations nuclear inspectors prepared to visit the Yongbyon reactor today, which North Korea has promised to shut down. “The United States is deeply troubled that North Korea has decided to launch these missiles during a delicate time in the six-party talks,” said Gordon D. Johndroe, a spokesman for theNational Security Council. He added that the United States expected North Korea “to refrain from conducting further provocative ballistic missile launches.” But a Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Chito Peppler of the Navy, played down the  launchings and said they were short-range missiles.  “We believe that this was a routine exercise,” he said.

U.S. officials say doubts about the progress of North Korea’s uranium enrichment gives the country a face-saving way to surrender its nuclear equipment.

WASHINGTON, March 4  —  In an effort to make the best of newly murky intelligence aboutNorth Korea, Bush administration officials say they plan to tell the North’s   nuclear negotiators on Monday that Washington’s doubts about how much progress the country has made in enriching uranium gives  North Korea   a face-saving way to surrender its nuclear equipment. The new approach to solve a  dispute over the existence and extent of  a uranium program, which intelligence agencies say could have been developed  using  equipment that the North Koreans purchased from Pakistan, will come at a meeting with North Korea at theUnited Nations. It is the first session intended  to hammer out a schedule under which North Korea is supposed to  disable its main nuclear plant and then account for all its nuclear programs. Because the agreement includes providing North Korea with  a million tons of fuel oil  before it turns over  its suspected arsenal of nuclear arms and fuel, some of President Bush’s conservative allies have denounced it as a dangerous concession. Mr. Bush has called it a “first step,” though it bears similarities to the kind of deal that the administration rejected in its first term. On Sunday, Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, said that at the meeting he planned to “form an agenda to work on our bilateral relationship —  what’s involved in the establishment of diplomatic relations, what’s involved before North Korea can get off the state-sponsor-of-terrorism list, and how to get them off the Trading with the Enemies Act.” He said he would  be “pressing for disclosure of all their nuclear programs, including highly enriched uranium.” Persuading North Korea to address  that program will be particularly challenging —  both because the North Koreans have denied seeking to enrich uranium and because a top American intelligence official told Congress last week that there was  only moderate confidence that the equipment  North Korea bought had been used. But that ambiguity, officials say, may give North Korea the chance to turn over its equipment with a vague explanation that an effort to produce energy, rather than a bomb, did not work out. That is a very different tone than intelligence officials struck in November 2002, just after American officials told the North Koreans that they had discovered evidence of the purchase of centrifuges, the high-speed devices that enrich uranium, from Abdul Qadeer Khan, the head of Pakistan’s nuclear program. In an unclassified, single-page report distributed to members of Congress at the time, top agency officials, headed by George J. Tenet, then the director of the Central Intelligence Agency,  reported, “We recently learned that the North is constructing a plant that could produce enough weapons-grade uranium for two or more nuclear weapons per year when fully operational —  which could be as soon as mid-decade.” On Friday, three days after the testimony of Joseph DeTrani, the North Korea coordinator for the director of national intelligence, suggesting doubts about the current state of the program, Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan and the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, sent a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates seeking more answers. “Is this still the intelligence community’s assessment?” he asked of the 2002 report. “If not, why, and when did the intelligence community revise this assessment? What is the current intelligence community assessment?” He also asked what underlay the conclusion that an enrichment plant was under construction.

The negotiations appeared near collapse on Sunday over North Korea’s demands for huge shipments of fuel oil and electricity.

BEIJING, Feb. 11 — Negotiations on a step-by-step deal that the Bush administration hopes will leadNorth Koreato give up its nuclear weapons program appeared near collapse on Sunday over North Korea’s demands for huge shipments of fuel oil and electricity before agreeing to a schedule for turning over its nuclear weapons and fuel. The chief American envoy, Christopher R. Hill, said he and North Korea’s envoy, Kim Kye-gwan, held a “lengthy and very frank” meeting on Sunday. But Mr. Hill seemed much less optimistic that a deal could be struck. Negotiators are planning to end the talks on Monday, and other envoys were pessimistic that any breakthrough would emerge on the final day. Meanwhile, a summary of the proposed agreement being circulated among senior policy makers in Washington makes it clear that even if the North agreed to take the listed first steps — sealing its main nuclear reactor and inviting international inspectors back into the country — there was no specified time period during which it would  be required to turn over any nuclear weapons or weapons fuel that it has produced in recent years.  And such a turnover would happen  only after reaching another agreement. In essence, the agreement Mr. Hill, an assistant secretary of state, is negotiating could prevent the North from producing more weapons, but defers discussions over the weapons and fuel it has stockpiled. Mr. Hill had earlier suggested that if there was agreement, follow-up talks could be set up in March and April. The summary calls for all six nations in the talks — the others are South Korea, Japan, China and Russia — to “create working groups for full and rapid implementation” of a September 2005 agreement in which the North agreed in principle to abandon its nuclear weapons. But in the past, the North Korean envoys to similar working groups have proven to have no real negotiating authority. Furthermore, the proposed agreement sets no dates on nuclear action beyond shutting down the nuclear plant at Yongbyon and allowing inspectors in within 60 days; it leaves unresolved what the North would get in return. The summary was given to The New York Times by a person trying to explain the timing and vagueness of the deal’s elements. After months of preparation that created unusual optimism within the Bush administration, failure to reach even a preliminary agreement could cast doubt on the prospects of disarming North Korea in the administration’s last two years. Several Asian diplomats said  they feared that North Korea had sensed the American distraction in Iraq and could be trying to run out the clock until the election of a new president. At the same time, the North is under pressure because of the effectiveness of financial sanctions, particularly those aimed at Kim Jong-il and other North Korean leaders, and it may feel this is a good time to extract concessions from the South Korean government, which is clinging to economic ties to the North. Mr. Hill, a seasoned negotiator who played a critical role in the Dayton accords that ended conflict in the Balkans in 1995, made it clear that the United States would not sign a deal that provided North Korea with energy but failed to ensure that it gave up its nuclear material. “We’re not looking to provide energy assistance so that they could avoid taking the further steps on denuclearization,” he said at a news conference late Sunday in Beijing. “We understand that you can’t just get there in one jump, you have to take several steps, so we’re prepared to take several steps.” He added, “But we’re not interested in providing that kind of assistance so that they don’t have to take the next step.” In the past, the North has always insisted that it get rewards before giving away the nuclear ability that Mr. Kim regards as his sole international bargaining chip. Kyodo, the Japanese news agency, has reported that North Korea wants an annual energy package of two million tons of fuel oil and two million kilowatts of electricity for taking the first steps in the agreement. It quoted unidentifed diplomatic contacts who said the North also wanted a short-term infusion of hundreds of thousands of tons of fuel oil almost immediately. That presumably would be a reward for shutting down Yongbyon, even though it  does not provide electric energy. Any deal would inevitably be compared with the 1994 agreement between the Clinton administration and North Korea. President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice have  criticized that accord because it involved a “freeze” on activity that the North could quickly reverse, and because it left the shipment of weapons and fuel out of the country to the very end. The agreement fell apart in 2002, and the North is believed to have then converted its spent nuclear fuel into weapons. The North tested its first nuclear device in October, though with only partial success. Outside experts familiar with the outlines of the proposed deal say that the Bush administration would give up relatively little at the beginning,  but it would also receive little. “Freezing and disabling Yongbyon is an important but modest step,” said Michael Green, who negotiated with North Korea as the top Asia expert at the National Security Council until he left a year ago. “It does not yet capture harvested plutonium and the existing weapons.” If a deal holds together, he said, “the key will be retaining leverage” on the North by preventing China, Russia and South Korea from increasing their economic cooperation so much that that their actions negate the United Nations Security Council sanctions on the North. According to the outline, the proposed agreement would establish “tight timelines for actions that are measured in months, not years,” and would include a flurry of moves in the first 60 days, among them the closing of the Yongbyon facilities. Inspectors would return to the country for the first time in more than four years, and the North would have to declare “all of its existing nuclear programs.” That is a reference to the American accusation that the North has a hidden program to enrich uranium, purchased from the rogue Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan. The North once admitted to the existence of the program, American officials say, but has since denied it. The working groups outlined by the proposed agreement would discuss denuclearization, economic and energy cooperation, normalization of diplomatic relations, and a peace treaty formally ending the Korean War. The North’s commitments, the document says, “are to all five other parties, including China,” and it says that “conventional energy assistance will be determined by the working group and will be commensurate with the steps” North Korea takes to fulfill its commitments. The huge annual energy package North Korea is demanding would eclipse the aid provided under the 1994 deal, when the North was promised light-water nuclear reactors with a generating capacity of two million kilowatts of electricity, as well as a temporary fix of 500,000 tons of heavy fuel oil. The chief Japanese envoy, Kenichiro Sasae, told Kyodo, “The problem is that North Korea has excessive expectations about this, and unless it reconsiders this issue, an agreement will be difficult.” North Korea’s insistence on the package deflated the optimism that had infused the early days of this round of talks and spread to senior officials in the White House, who said they expected a deal this weekend. By Sunday afternoon, diplomats had decided that Monday would be the final day of talks, agreement or no. According to Reuters, South Korea’s representative, Chun Yung-woo, blamed the size of the energy package “and the scope, pace and range of the North’s actions to denuclearize” for the stalemate. The Russian envoy, Aleksandr Losyukov, suggested that the best outcome might be a “chairman’s statement” by China that summarized the negotiations. “It seems the chances to reach a joint statement are slim,” Mr. Losyukov said, according to Xinhua, China’s official news agency.

The return of an official who was banished may signal a renewed openness to economic reforms.
==::==
2010-08-24T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — A former North Korean prime minister who was banished three years ago for pushing market-oriented reforms too far has returned to the center of economic policy, leading to speculation that the nation’s leader, Kim Jong-il, might give such proposals a second chance. The former prime minister, Pak Pong-ju, 71, resurfaced at a state function in the capital, Pyongyang, on Saturday, carrying the title of first deputy director of the central committee of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea, according to the North’s state-run Central Broadcasting Station. He is the latest among senior North Korean officials whose sudden banishment and equally unexpected reinstatement have sparked outside speculation about Mr. Kim’s intentions. Mr. Pak appeared to have fallen from Mr. Kim’s favor when he was fired from the premiership in 2007 and sent to work as a factory manager in a provincial town. “His reinstatement could signal the return of pragmatists and reformists,” said Cheong Seong-chang, aNorth Koreaanalyst in the Sejong Institute south of Seoul. “We may be able to see him push the economic reform and openness he had once championed.” Analysts in Seoul say that few North Korean officials wield much individual influence in Mr. Kim’s government. But they say that they can infer Mr. Kim’s plans from the way he punishes and rewards officials identified with various policy approaches. “Pak’s reinstatement indicates that North Korea is shifting back to market reforms, even if grudgingly, after its botched attempt to re-enforce state control on the economy,” said Baek Seung-joo, the head of North Korea research at the government-financed Korea Institute for Defense Analyses in Seoul. Mr. Pak, a lifetime technocrat, was best known as the architect of “Measures to Improve Economic Management Order.” Issued on July 1, 2002, they indirectly acknowledged the failure of the North’s ration system by instructing factories, collective farms and other economic units to provide their own daily necessities and give incentives for workers. In September 2003 Mr. Pak was made prime minister, a post in charge of carrying out economic policies. His reforms were necessitated by the collapse of the centrally planned economy after a famine in the mid-1990s. But they also coincided with — and fueled — the spread of private markets, which quickly emerged as a key source of food and other necessities for North Koreans. But Mr. Pak’s reform programs irked the government’s old guard, especially in the hard-line military, which had grabbed the lion’s share in trade under the old system. The markets facilitated the influx of DVDs and other smuggled goods the government considered a capitalist threat. Around 2005, North Korea began controlling markets. Its attempt to reinforce state control on the economy peaked late last year whenit replaced its banknotes with a new currency, shut down markets and ordered people to buy goods only from state-run stores. The currency reform was aimed at stifling the markets by drastically reducing traders’ personal wealth in the old currency. Themoves quickly backfired. Inflation surged as traders hoarded their goods and government stores failed to meet demand. Sporadic protests were reported. Earlier this year, Pak Nam-gi, head of finance and planning who led the failed currency reform, was executed, according to South Korean news reports. North Korean markets began coming back to life, according to recent defectors. Pak Pong-ju, the former prime minister,  returns as North Korea prepares for a party caucus early next month. Officials and analysts in Seoul say they will monitor the meeting for changes in the cabinet and party leadership that might provide clues to Mr. Kim’s plans to hand over power to his third son,Kim Jong-un, who is in his late 20s. Mr. Pak’s reinstatement adds to the growing influence of Jang Song-taek, Mr. Kim’s brother-in-law, said Mr. Baek, the researcher. In June, Mr. Kim presided over a session of the rubber-stamp Supreme People’s Assembly where Mr. Jang, a potential caretaker for his son, was elevated to the No. 2 post in the ruling hierarchy. In the same meeting, Mr. Pak’s successor as prime minister, Kim Yong-il, who reportedly made a rare apology in February for the botched currency reform, was fired. Mr. Pak, as first deputy director, is believed to report directly to Kim Kyong-hee, Mr. Kim’s younger sister and Mr. Jang’s wife, who works as party director in charge of the North’s light industries, Mr. Cheong said. Mr. Jang, 64, is widely seen as a main player in ensuring the transfer of power to the leader’s son. He may even head a collective caretaker government if Mr. Kim dies before his son is firmly in control  or is seen as too young to lead a ruling hierarchy that includes generals in their 70s and 80s, analysts said.

SEOUL, South Korea — North Korean doctors perform operations withoutanesthesiain clinics wherehypodermic needlesare not sterilized and sheets are not washed, the human rights groupAmnesty Internationalsaid in areportreleased on Thursday. “Five medical assistants held my arms and legs down to keep me from moving,” the report quoted a 24-year-old North Korean defector as saying, describing how his left leg was amputated without anesthesia after a train accident. “I was in so much pain that I screamed and eventually fainted from pain.” Other defectors told similarly horrific stories. One said her appendix was removed without anesthesia and her hands and feet were bound to prevent her from moving during the procedure. Others told of entire cities with no ambulances. Drawn from interviews with more than 40 North Koreans who had defected over the past six years, as well as with health professionals who had worked with North Koreans, the report depicted a North Korean health system in dire straits. Long cut off from most of the world,North Koreahas been pushing its people even deeper into isolation. Rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula after the North’s nuclear test last year and the North’s presumed role in the sinking of a South Korean warship in March have driven away potential aid donors. The government’s botched currency reform late last year also worsened chronic food shortages in the North. “The North Korean people are in critical need of medical andfood aid,” said Catherine Baber, Amnesty International’s deputy director for the Asia-Pacific. “It is crucial that aid to North Korea is not used as a political football by donor countries.” North Korea claims that it offers free medical service for all its people. But in reality, patients have had to pay their doctors with cash, cigarettes, alcohol and food since the 1990s, the 50-page report said. “Many North Koreans bypass doctors altogether, going straight to the markets to buy medicine, self-medicating according to their own guesswork or the advice of market vendors,” it said. “The North Korean authorities recently banned a highly addictive narcotic painkiller that many North Koreans routinely used as a cure-all.” North Korea spends less on health care than any other country in the world — less than $1 per person per year, according to the World Health Organization. As some North Koreans resorted to eating grass, tree bark and roots, tuberculosis has made a comeback in North Korea, Amnesty International said. For years, North Koreans fleeing their country have told of a deteriorating health care system, especially after the collapse of the economy in the mid-1990s.

North Korea said Friday it would release an American who illegally entered the country on Christmas Day to urge its leader, Kim Jong-il, to resign.

SEOUL —North Koreasaid Friday that it would release Robert Park, a Christian missionary from the United States who illegally entered the country on Christmas Day to urge its leader, Kim Jong-il, to shut down its concentration camps, free all its prisoners and resign. North Korean officials said they “decided to leniently forgive and release him, taking his admission and sincere repentance of his wrongdoings into consideration,” according to a report by the North’s official news agency, K.C.N.A. North Korea hadremained silent about the fate of Mr. Park,28, a Korean-American religious activist from Tucson who disappeared into the isolated nation after walking across a frozen river that makes up part of the border with China. Before his trip, he told friends in Seoul that he would die with political prisoners in the North if Mr. Kim refused to free them. But Mr. Park confessed that he had been wrong about the North after meeting kind North Koreans, the K.C.N.A. report said. “I seriously repent of the wrong I committed, taken in by the West’s false propaganda,” it quoted Mr. Park as saying in an interview. “What I have seen and heard in the North convinced me that I misunderstood it.” The agency said Mr. Park gave the interview voluntarily. There was no indication when he might be released. Mr. Park also was quoted as saying that his prejudices about the North were shattered first by North Korean border guards who protected his human rights and later by the “shocking fact” he learned during a visit to Pongsu Church in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, that freedom of religion was fully protected in the North. “They even returned my Bible to me,” he was quoted as saying. “This fact alone was enough to convince me that there was a complete freedom of religion.” Pongsu Church is widely believed to be fake: The North takes outside visitors there to advertise its claim to religious freedom. Jo Sung-rae, the head of Pax Koreana, a conservative civic group in Seoul that supported Mr. Park’s mission to North Korea, said he believed that the American was coerced to make his statement praising the North. He said that he had heard from sources inside the North that Mr. Park had been severely beaten. When he crossed the border into the North, Mr. Park was carrying statements bitterly criticizing Mr. Kim for human rights violations and calling for his resignation, his friends said. Such criticism is a grave crime in North Korea, one that usually entails a lengthy term in a prison camp, if not immediate execution, according to officials and analysts in Seoul. The North had previously freed American citizens under detention, but usually after high-profile foreign envoys visited Pyongyang. The North’s decision to free Mr. Park without demanding such a visit — which could be used for domestic propaganda — comes as it seeks to draw Washington into bilateral talks. There was no immediate comment from the United States government. Washington does not have diplomatic ties with North Korea and has been working through the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang to gain consular access to Mr. Park. Last month, Robert R. King, President Obama’s envoy on North Korean human rights issues, called the North “one of the worst places in terms of lack of human rights.” North Korea keeps an estimated 160,000 political prisoners in labor camps, according to reports from the United States and South Korean governments. It also punished religious activities, they said.

North Koreaacknowledged that it had detained an American for illegally crossing into its territory from China, the second United States citizen to be held as the North’s dispute with Washington over itsnuclear weaponsprogram continues. The American entered North Korea on Monday and was under interrogation, the North’s state-run news agency, K.C.N.A., said. The other American being held is believed to be Robert Park, a Christian missionary from Arizona.

North Korea put further pressure on the U.S. to start bilateral talks by declaring that it had completed reprocessing its spent nuclear fuel for use in a bomb.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreaput further pressure on the United States to start bilateral talks  by declaring on Tuesday that it had completed reprocessing its spent nuclear fuel for use in  a  bomb. In early September, North Korea had told the United Nations Security Council that it was in the “final phase” of reprocessing 8,000 spent fuel rods unloaded from its nuclear reactor in Yongbyon,  north of Pyongyang, and was “weaponizing” plutonium extracted from the rods. If reprocessed with chemicals, the rods could yield enough plutonium for at least one nuclear  bomb, according to officials and nuclear experts in Seoul and Washington. Using the same procedure at Yongbyon, North Korea was believed to have already accumulated enough plutonium for six to eight bombs. On Monday, the North’s official news agency, K.C.N.A., said that the country  completed reprocessing the 8,000 rods two months ago  and had made “significant achievements” in turning the plutonium into an atomic bomb. “We have no option but to strengthen our self-defense nuclear deterrent in the face of increasing nuclear threats and military provocations from hostile forces,” the  news agency said. North Korea conducted  underground nuclear tests in October 2006 and in May. In April, it also test-fired a long-range rocket. If fully developed, the rocket, known as a Taepodong-2, is feared to have the capacity to deliver a nuclear warhead as far as North America. Those moves resulted in new  United Nations   sanctions. Now, North Korea is trying to draw the United States back to the negotiating table, where its threats to reactivate its Yongbyon nuclear complex and acquire more   bomb material serve as its strongest negotiating tool to obtain humanitarian aid, diplomatic recognition and other rewards. On Monday, North Korea pressed the United States for a decision about starting bilateral talks, warning that it was ready to proceed   with itsnuclear weaponsprogram. North Korea has also  said it was also enriching uranium. Highly-enriched uranium would give it  another route to build nuclear bombs.

Bill Clinton’s trip will have been well worth the effort if it laid the groundwork for truly productive talks on North Korea’s nuclear programs.

Sending a former president to secure the release of two journalists detained by North Korea was a big step, but Bill Clinton’s trip will have been well worth the effort if it laid the groundwork for truly productive talks on North Korea’s nuclear programs. Now it is up to President Obama to make it clear to Pyongyang that it is no longer good enough to make easily broken promises. Even before Mr. Clinton’s mission this week to rescue Laura Ling and Euna Lee from a 12-year sentence to North Korea’s gulag, Obama administration officials concluded that Pyongyang was looking for a face-saving way to re-engage with Washington. North Korea made a colossal mistake by getting off to a bad start with President Obama, who offered the kind of dialogue that President George W. Bush took far too long to embrace. The North Koreans responded by breaking off six-country negotiations, conducting a second nuclear test, and test-firing missiles. They also vowed to make more nuclear weapons and threatened military action against efforts to isolate it, and may have resumed nuclear fuel production. There are growing concerns about Pyongyang’s willingness to sell missiles and other technology to other states. We do not know the details of Mr. Clinton’s meetings, but we hope they lead to future talks. That poses a challenge for Mr. Obama: while he must pursue this opening, he must not be so desperate for a deal that he lets North Korea set all the terms. He struck the right note when he told MSNBC on Wednesday that Mr. Clinton’s mission had not eased the need for North Korea to alter its behavior if it wants a “path to better relations.” To start, that means not giving in to Pyongyang’s desire to make the talks a bilateral process with Washington. It is imperative to keep South Korea, Japan, China and Russia — key participants in any effective deal — engaged. Officials from Washington and Pyongyang can still meet separately, as they did under Mr. Bush. Most important, the United States and its partners need to make clear that the expectations are higher than they were before — that North Korea will not be rewarded again just for recommitting to promises that were broken before and likely will be broken again. Future steps toward disarmament must be irreversible. Under a 2005 agreement, North Korea shut down its reactor at Yongbyon — the source of plutonium for its nuclear weapons — and promised to dismantle its bomb-making infrastructure. It has since kicked out international inspectors and claims to be rebuilding and resuming its capabilities. One way to make disablement more permanent: pour concrete into the reactor core. The United States and its partners also have to re-establish their credibility; North Korea never received all the fuel deliveries promised under the 2005 deal. At the same time, however, Washington and its partners must keep enforcing the tougher Security Council sanctions imposed on Pyongyang in June. It is understandable to doubt that impoverished North Korea will ever abandon its nuclear program — its only form of leverage over the rest of the world. But patient — and firm — engagement backed by sanctions still offers the best path toward a peaceful solution, however tortuous it might be.

Former President Bill Clinton and the two freed journalists were greeted at the airport by family members and Al Gore, who founded the company that employs the journalists.
==::==
2009-08-06T00:00:00Z
==::==
WASHINGTON — Former PresidentBill Clintonarrived in the United States Wednesday morning after a dramatic 20-hour visit toNorth Korea, in which he won the freedom of two American journalists, opened a diplomatic channel to North Korea’s reclusive government and dined with the North’s ailing leader, Kim Jong-il. The private plane carrying Mr. Clinton and the journalists,Laura Ling, 32, andEuna Lee, 36, landed at 5:50 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time at Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, just outside Los Angeles. The two women stepped off the plane in jeans and sweaters, rushing down the stairs to be reunited with their families, who clustered around them. Ms. Lee, in tears, embraced her husband, Michael Saldate, and knelt to hug her 4-year-old daughter, Hana. Ms. Ling kissed her husband, Iain Clayton. Mr. Clinton stepped off the plane a few moments later, embracing former Vice President Al Gore, the founder of the media company that employs the journalists. “Thirty hours ago, Euna Lee and I were prisoners in North Korea,” Ms. Ling said in brief remarks to reporters, blinking back tears. “We feared that at any moment we could be prisoners in a hard labor camp. Then suddenly we were told that we were going to a meeting. “We were taken to a location and when we walked through the doors, we saw standing before us President Bill Clinton,” she said, recounting the final moments of her ordeal. “We were shocked, but we knew instantly in our hearts that the nightmare of our lives was finally coming to an end. And now we stand here home and free.” Mr. Gore then spoke. “President Obama and countless members of his administration have been deeply involved,” in the effort to bring the women home, he said. “To everybody who has played a part in this,” he said, “we are so grateful.” The North Korean government, whichin June sentenced the women to 12 years of hard laborfor illegally entering North Korean territory, announced hours before the jet’s departure from North Korea that it had pardoned the women after Mr. Clinton apologized to Mr. Kim for their actions, according to the North Korean state media. Mr. Clinton’s wife, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, said Wednesday that the administration was “extremely excited” that the women would be reunited with their families. But she denied that her husband had apologized. President Obama, who contacted the families of the women on Tuesday evening, said that he, too, was “extraordinarily relieved” at the journalists’ return. “I want to thank President Bill Clinton — I had a chance to talk to him — for the extraordinary humanitarian effort that resulted in the release of the two journalists,” Mr. Obama said outside the White House on Wednesday morning. Mr. Clinton’s mission to Pyongyang was the most visible by an American in nearly a decade. It came at a time when the United States’ relationship with North Korea had become especially chilled, after North Korea’s test of its second nuclear device in May and a series of missile launchings. It ended a harrowing ordeal for the two women, who were stopped on March 17 by soldiers near North Korea’s border with China while researching a report about women and human trafficking. They faced years of imprisonment in the gulag-like confines of a North Korean prison camp. And it catapulted Mr. Clinton back on to the global stage, on behalf of a president who defeated Mrs. Clinton in a bitter primary campaign last year, and who later asked her to be his secretary of state. Mrs. Clinton was deeply involved in the case, too. She proposed sending various people to Pyongyang — including Mr. Gore — to lobby for the release of the women, before Mr. Clinton emerged as the preferred choice of the North Koreans, people briefed on the talks said. About 10 days ago, these people said, Mr. Gore called Mr. Clinton to ask him to undertake the trip. Mr. Clinton agreed, as long as the Obama administration did not object. In an interview Wednesday with NBC’s “Today” show in Nairobi, Kenya, Mrs. Clinton said the final request to Mr. Clinton had come from the White House. “When the message came to us from the young women themselves, to their families, to former Vice President Gore, and then to the administration that sending my husband would be the best way to ensure their release, of course we took that very seriously, discussed it,” she said, according to a transcript. “The White House reached out, as they said, to my husband, to ask him if he would be willing to do that.” The riveting tableau, of a former president jetting into a diplomatic crisis while his wife was embarking on a tour of Africa in her role as the nation’s chief diplomat, underscored the unique and enduring role of the Clintons, even in the Obama era. At a news conference in Nairobi on Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton said the case of the captured Americans had been handled separately from America’s dispute with North Korea over its nuclear program. “We have been working hard on the release of the two journalists, and we have always considered that a separate issue,” she said. The future of the United States’ relationship with Pyongyang, she continued, was “really up to them.” Mr. Clinton’s trip to Pyongyang came just two weeks after North Korea issued a harsh personal attack on Mrs. Clinton, in response to comments she made comparing its nuclear test and missile launchings to the behavior of an attention-seeking teenager. The North Korean Foreign Ministry objected to her “vulgar remarks” and called her “a funny lady” who was neither intelligent nor diplomatic. “Sometimes she looks like a primary-school girl and sometimes a pensioner going shopping,” a spokesman said. The episode evidently did not stop consideration of sending her husband as an envoy. But the initiative was cloaked in secrecy and came after weeks of back-channel talks between the United States and North Korea through its United Nations mission. In addition to Mr. Gore, the White House’s list of potential candidates included Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico. North Korea signaled its desire to have Mr. Clinton act as a special envoy in conversations with Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee, who relayed that message to their families in the middle of July, according to a senior administration official. The message was passed to Mr. Gore, who contacted the White House, which then explored whether such a mission would be successful. Mr. Obama did not speak directly with Mr. Clinton before the mission. But his national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, contacted the former president to sound him out. The senior official said the administration did “due diligence” with the North Koreans to ensure that if Mr. Clinton went, he would return with the journalists. As president, Mr. Clinton had sent Mr. Kim a letter of condolence on the death of his father, Kim Il-sung, according to a former official. For Mr. Kim, the former official said, freeing the women was a “reciprocal humanitarian gesture.” Mr. Kim is believed to have suffered a stroke last year. American officials said they thought his declining health had set off a succession struggle, complicating the Obama administration’s dealings with the North. The families of the American journalists issued a statement saying they were “overjoyed” by news of the pardon and thanked Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton. “We especially want to thank President Bill Clinton for taking on such an arduous mission and Vice President Al Gore for his tireless efforts to bring Laura and Euna home,” the statement said. Current TVsaid in a statement that it was also “overjoyed” and that the hearts of its employees went out to Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee for “persevering through this horrible experience.” Mr. Clinton and the journalists traveled on a private jet owned by Stephen Bing, a real estate heir and a major Democratic Party contributor, who donated the use of the jet as a favor, said Andy Meyers, the chief executive officer of Shangri-la Industries, which was founded by Mr. Bing. Administration officials said Mr. Clinton went to North Korea as a private citizen, did not carry a message from Mr. Obama for Mr. Kim and had the authority to negotiate only for the women’s release. “This was 100 percent about the journalists,” said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter. “We knew Kim Jong-il would probably seek a meeting with Clinton. But that’s not what this visit was about.” Still, North Korea, clearly seeing a propaganda opportunity at home and a rare chance for a measure of favorable publicity abroad, welcomed Mr. Clinton with the fanfare of a state visit. It broadcast a group portrait, as well as photos of Mr. Kim gesturing and talking to Mr. Clinton; of the former president accepting flowers from a North Korean girl; and of Mr. Clinton, seated across a negotiating table from Mr. Kim, each flanked by  aides. Among those greeting Mr. Clinton at the airport was Kim Kye-gwan, North Korea’s chief nuclear negotiator. Among those accompanying Mr. Clinton was David Straub, a former director of the Korea desk at the State Department, who had held talks with the North Koreans through what is known as the “New York connection.” Also on hand was John Podesta, an informal adviser to the Obama administration who served as Mr. Clinton’s chief of staff in the final years of his presidency, when the former president yearned to travel to North Korea to clinch a deal that would have curbed its nuclear program. That visit never happened — partly because the White House concluded that a deal was not assured — and former President George W. Bush put the brakes on direct talks with North Korea, setting the stage for eight years of largely fruitless efforts to stop the North’s nuclear ambitions. Given Mr. Clinton’s stature and his long interest in the North Korean nuclear issue, experts said it was likely that his discussions in North Korea ranged well beyond obtaining the release of Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee. “It would be someplace between surprising and shocking if there wasn’t some substantive discussion between the former president, who is deeply knowledgeable about the nuclear issue, and Kim Jong-il,” said Robert L. Gallucci, who negotiated with North Korea in the Clinton administration. Mr. Clinton has sought to find the right place in the Obama era, eager to play a role without stepping on the toes of the new president or, certainly, the secretary of state. The last time the two had spoken, said the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, was in March, when Mr. Obama invited Mr. Clinton to a ceremony in Washington for signing legislation expanding the AmeriCorps program created by Mr. Clinton. In interviews last spring, Mr. Clinton said that he would be happy to do anything Mr. Obama asked him to do, but that “I try to stay out of their way.” Mr. Clinton’s mission may be less of an issue for Mr. Obama than for Mrs. Clinton. The same day he landed in North Korea, she arrived in Kenya, beginning an 11-day journey through Africa — a visit now largely eclipsed by her husband’s travels.

Kim Jong-il has pancreatic cancer and the illness is life-threatening, the South Korean broadcaster YTN said.
==::==
2009-07-14T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — The North Korean leaderKim Jong-il, who suffered a stroke last August, was also found to have “life-threatening” pancreatic cancer around the same time, a South Korean cable television network reported on Monday. The network, YTN, a cable news station, quoted unidentified Chinese and South Korean intelligence sources for the report, which was made by YTN’s correspondent in Beijing. The station did not explain how the sources obtained the sensitive medical information fromNorth Korea, an isolated, nuclear-armed state that has kept details of its leader’s health a closely guarded secret. South Korean officials said Monday that they could not confirm the report, but added that they were studying possible causes of Mr. Kim’s recent loss of weight. If the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer were true, Mr. Kim might not have much longer to live. Pancreatic cancer is one of the most difficult cancers to detect early. It spreads rapidly, and the fatality rate is high. The World Health Organization says fewer than 5 percent of patients with pancreatic cancer live longer than five years. Although Mr. Kim began making occasional public appearances a few months after he mysteriously disappeared last August, photographs of him and television images recently carried by the North Korean media showed him limping and frail. Mr. Kim’s loss of weight, in particular, has elevated speculation about the severity and nature of what is wrong with him. The Unification Ministry, a South Korean government agency in charge of relations with North Korea, “has no information” on Mr. Kim’s reported cancer, said Chun Hae-sung, a spokesman. The National Intelligence Service and other government agencies also said they could not confirm it, repeating their standard answer to a recent flurry of thinly sourced and often speculative reports about Mr. Kim’s health. Mr. Kim’s health is a topic of intense international interest, in large part because world leaders and governments are unclear about who would succeed him. North Korea is one of the world’s most unpredictable nations, and any transfer of power will focus new attention on the security of its nuclear arsenal. South Korean news media scrutinized every still photo and segment of television footage of Mr. Kim released by North Korea. In his latest public appearance last Wednesday at a memorial for his father, the founder of North Korea, Kim Il-sung, Mr. Kim looked thinner and appeared to have less hair than before. His mouth looked lopsided. That led to a slew of speculative reports, though Mr. Kim walked on his own into last week’s ceremony. “When I saw his loss of weight, I thought of diabetes or cancer,” said Hyun Jong-jin, a gastroenterologist at Korea University Anam Hospital in Seoul. “But by just looking at him in those pictures, you can not say he has a pancreatic cancer.” Doctors say that a person with chronic diabetes, a smoking habit and obesity is more likely to get pancreatic cancer. Mr. Kim before his reported stroke fits the description. The Seoul government has long suspected Mr. Kim of having diabetes. “We are looking into what his loss of weight means,” said a senior government official in Seoul who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing his department policy. “But if he is a pancreatic cancer patient, he is remarkably doing well because he is making quite a few public appearances.” Mr. Kim has made dozens of visits to military units, farms and factories this year, the Unification Ministry said, citing North Korean news reports. Mr. Kim inherited power after his father died in 1994 at the age of 82. American intelligence officials said last fall that Mr. Kim was seriously ill, although the exact nature of his illness has been a matter of speculation. A French neurosurgeon who has treated Mr. Kim said the North Korean leader did have a stroke last August. In December, the doctor, Francois-Xavier Roux, told Le Figaro, the French daily newspaper: “Kim Jong-il suffered a stroke but did not undergo an operation. He is now better.” In May, North Korea tested its second nuclear device in a move that shocked and angered the international community. Even China, the North’s closest ally, condemned the test. Mr. Kim has three known sons, and in recent months there have been widespread reports — many of them thinly sourced — that the youngest son, Kim Jong-un, has been designated the heir apparent.

The defense secretary warned North Korea that the U.S. will not accept it as a nuclear-armed state.

SINGAPORE — Defense SecretaryRobert M. GateswarnedNorth Koreaon Saturday that the United States would not accept it as anuclear weaponsstate and would consider any transfer of nuclear material to other countries or terrorist groups a “grave threat” to the United States and its allies. “We will not stand idly by as North Korea builds the capability to wreak destruction on any target in the region — or on us,” Mr. Gates told a major security conference here that has been dominated by North Korea’s test this week of a nuclear device and the firing of at least six short-range missiles, all in defiance of international sanctions. North Korea test-fired a missile on Friday, according to a South Korean defense official. North Korea, Mr. Gates said, had a choice: “To continue as a destitute, international pariah, or chart a new course.” Mr. Gates, who was speaking for the first time at the annual conference, called the Shangri-La Dialogue, as an emissary of his new commander in chief, said the new administration had limited patience with North Korea’s bellicose words and behavior. “President Obama has offered an open hand to tyrannies that unclench their fists,” Mr. Gates said. “He is hopeful, but he is not naïve. Likewise, the United States and our allies are open to dialogue, but we will not bend to pressure or provocation.” Military officials traveling with Mr. Gates said the tough talk was aimed at increasing worldwide pressure on North Korea as well as reassuring allies in the region, particularly Japan and South Korea, that the United States was committed to their defense should North Korea make good on talk of war this week. On Wednesday, North Korea threatened military strikes against the South. The officials acknowledged that the United States had only limited information about what was happening inside North Korea and suspected but did not know for certain that its leader, Kim Jong-il, was in the midst of political maneuvers to make his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, his successor. The officials described the country’s leadership as unpredictable and bizarre. Mr. Gates’s sharp language was met with some skepticism by at least one participant in the conference, a Hong Kong television commentator, who in a question-and-answer session after the defense secretary’s formal remarks noted that although Mr. Gates had declared that the United States would not recognize North Korea as a nuclear weapons state, it was already a “de facto nuclear weapons state.” The questioner asked about the next step for the United States and whether the long-running six-nation talks aimed at getting North Korea to abandon its nuclear program had failed. Mr. Gates responded that the next step was political and that the United States would send a team to Asia to “reassess” how to go forward with the talks. He acknowledged, “It would be hard to point to them at this point as an example of success.” Although North Korea was the “hot topic” at the conference, as Mr. Gates put it to reporters on his plane, he also used the forum to appeal to Asian allies for help, both financial and military, with the war in Afghanistan. “I know some in Asia have concluded that Afghanistan does not represent a strategic threat to their countries, owing in part to Afghanistan’s geographic location,” Mr. Gates said. “But the threat from failed or failing states is international in scope.” In representing Mr. Obama, Mr. Gates concluded that the United States, “in our efforts to protect our own freedom, and that of others” had “from time to time made mistakes, including at times being arrogant in dealing with others.” He did not name names, but then said, “We always correct our course.”

North Korea’s state-run media have released a flurry of reports of public appearances by its reclusive leader, Kim Jong-il.
==::==
2008-11-07T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL, South Korea —North Korea’s state-run media outlets have released a flurry of reports of public appearances by the North’s reclusive leader,Kim Jong-il, in what analysts on Thursday described as an effort to demonstrate to his people and the outside world that he is firmly in control, despite widespread rumors of ill health. Since Sunday, news outlets in the North have described three separate appearances by Mr. Kim, 66, who officials in Washington and Seoul have said probablysuffered a strokearound August and may have undergone brain surgery. In the latest such report, the North’s official news agency,KCNA, said on Thursday that Mr. Kim had attended a concert, where a state choir and opera groups performed numbers like “Please Receive Our Salute!” Photographs of Mr. Kim that have accompanied these reports have been studied by North Korea watchers in government and media. Aided by neurosurgeons and other experts, they have scrutinized every detail, from Mr. Kim’s facial expressions to background scenery, to gauge his condition. “The reports and release of his pictures are carefully calculated and timed,” said Ryoo Kihl-jae, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. “It’s Kim Jong-il’s way of responding to the intense outside attention to him. He is a man very sensitive to how the outside world views him.” But the photographs have raised as many questions as they have answered. North Korea’s state media did not say when the pictures were taken, confounding the analysts. Undated pictures released on Oct. 11, for example, showed Mr. Kim inspecting a military unit and looking healthy. But they showed green foliage, while trees on the Korean Peninsula at the time were tinged with red and gold. Then, on Sunday, North Korea issued two photos of Mr. Kim, saying he was watching a soccer match. This time, the background vegetation had appropriately autumnal colors. In one picture, he was smiling. The smile, experts said, was symmetrical enough to exclude any serious paralysis of the facial muscles, a common occurrence among people who suffered a stroke. Mr. Kim also had a full head of hair, despite reports that he might have had a brain surgery. But the experts also noted that in both pictures Mr. Kim’s left hand looked immobile, either resting limply on his lap or in a pocket. They also noted that he was not wearing the shoes he usually uses to elevate his short stature. Such details led news media to speculate that Mr. Kim might be suffering paralysis on the left side of his body. On Wednesday, 14 photographs were released that seemed intended to dispel such notions. They showed Mr. Kim walking about and clapping his hands. “The fact that the North is going to such lengths to demonstrate that Kim Jong-il is O.K. is, ironically, a sign that his health is not normal,” Mr. Ryoo said. Other analysts said the timing of recent reports about Mr. Kim was linked to the American presidential election. “Kim Jong-il wants to show that he is in control and that he has no problem being a partner of dialogue with the United States,” said Kim Yong-yun, a North Korea expert at Dongguk University. He suggested that the North Korean leader might soon stage a “foolproof” demonstration of his health, for example by releasing a video of his public activities or paying a courtesy call to the Chinese Embassy in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang. China is North Korea’s main ally.

The chief American negotiator forNorth Koreaextended his talks in Pyongyang, the capital, on Thursday in an effort to salvage a crumbling nuclear disarmament deal, while the South Korean media reported that the North had been upgrading its ballistic missile test site. The unconfirmed reports on the missile base, Musudan, which is on North Korea’s northeast coast, came as the American negotiator, Christopher R. Hill, an assistant secretary of state, met North Korean officials in Pyongyang  to try to persuade them not to restart their nuclear weapons program in Yongbyon. Mr. Hill had been expected to return to Seoul, South Korea, on Thursday, and officials in Seoul declined to speculate on whether the extension of his stay was a sign of progress.

The Berlin Wall might be a thing of the past, but the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea — the world’s most heavily armed border — is still a modern-day phenomenon. Americans who’d like to take a peek behind North Korea’s Iron Curtain, including the zone have a chance to do so this fall with two tours offered by Snow Lion Expeditions (www.snowlion.com), a Salt Lake City-based travel company. “We have a crack in the door for Americans to get in,” said Steve Pastorino, vice president of marketing for the company, who has found a way to procure visas for Americans through a partnership with Koryo, a British consortium of documentary filmmakers and tour guides who work regularly in North Korea. The 11-day tours visit both North and South Korea, using Beijing as a home base. Highlights of the itinerary include attending the Mass Games, a color-coded, athletic performance organized by the state, and visiting sites like Kumsusan Memorial Palace, the mausoleum of Kim Il-Sung. The trip starts at $5,895, including guides, lodging, meals and admission — but not flights.

The White House is split on how long to exercise patience without jeopardizing the fulfillment of an agreement.
==::==

WASHINGTON — A debate is under way within the Bush administration over how long it can exercise patience withNorth Koreawithout jeopardizing the fulfillment of a nuclear agreement that President Bush has claimed as a foreign policy victory. With North Korea sending signals that it may be trying to wait out Mr. Bush’s time in office before making any more concessions, administration officials are grappling with how the United States should react. The debate has fractured along familiar lines, with a handful of national security hawks in Vice President Dick Cheney’s office and at the State Department arguing for a more confrontational approach with Pyongyang. On the other side, Mr. Bush’s lead North Korea nuclear negotiator, Christopher R. Hill, has argued that the United States should continue a more restrained approach, one that is widely credited with bringing about an agreement last year that is intended eventually to lead to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. While the restrained stance still appears to have support from Mr. Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, it is coming under fire from conservative critics, both in and out of the administration. In a public departure from administration policy, Jay Lefkowitz, a conservative lawyer who is Mr. Bush’s envoy on North Korean human rights, said this week the North would likely “remain in its present nuclear status” when the next president took over in January 2009. “North Korea is not serious about disarming in a timely manner,” Mr. Lefkowitz told an audience at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. “We should consider a new approach to North Korea.” At issue is a declaration that North Korea was supposed to make by the end of last year formally stating everything in its nuclear inventory. When the North missed that deadline, administration officials initially sought to minimize the significance of the lapse, but they have expressed increasing concern in the wake of a North Korean statement on Jan. 4, in which the North  insisted that it had already disclosed everything that it needed to. The North has cited a list of nuclear programs that it provided in November, but the United States has rejected the list as incomplete. “Some people make the argument that we’re just pursuing a policy of talks that go nowhere,” said one administration official with knowledge of the debate within the administration. John R. Bolton, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations, argued in a Wall Street Journal op-ed article last week that the Bush administration should dump the nuclear pact with North Korea because, he said, Pyongyang was not interested in giving up its nuclear program. “They’re in the classic North Korean role of deception,” Mr. Bolton said in an interview. “It’s like groundhog day; we’ve lived through this before.” Mr. Bush said the two countries needed to resolve three sticking points: the number of warheads that North Korea has built; the amount of weapons-grade nuclear material produced by North Korea; and the need for North Korea to disclose that it has passed nuclear material to others. The proliferation issue has taken on new importance after an Israeli strike in Syria in September, which American and Israeli officials said was conducted against a nuclear facility near the Euphrates River that was supplied with material from North Korea. Administration officials want North Korea to disclose what help it may have given Syria, although they also say that the help came before the North agreed to dismantle its nuclear reactor and disclose its nuclear programs. Mr. Bolton and other critics of the agreement, including the officials in Mr. Cheney’s office, never liked the pact to begin with, and advocates of the deal with North Korea say their second-guessing is expected. They argue that the Bush administration’s previous confrontational strategy with North Korea is part of what led to the North’s detonation of a nuclear device in October 2006. Besides the United States and North Korea, the other parties to the nuclear pact include China, South Korea, Japan and Russia. “People lambaste the six-party process, and sure, it offers no refuge for those in need of instant gratification,” Mr. Hill, the negotiator, said in an interview. “But when asked for alternatives” to the nuclear pact, Mr. Hill said, “even the noisiest critics fall silent.” Administration officials say that the North has remained true to one part of the October agreement: It has made great strides in disabling and dismantling its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon. “Bush can say, with credit, that he has achieved more than any other administration as far as dismantlement,” said Gary Samore, a vice president at the Council on Foreign Relations who helped negotiate the Clinton administration’s 1994 agreement with North Korea. “He can say that he managed to freeze further production, and handed the next administration a diplomatic process.” But Bush administration officials say that they want more than just dismantlement on their record, and insist that they have not written off their chances of getting North Korea to make a complete declaration of its nuclear programs before the end of the administration. Bush officials say they will not ultimately be able to verify that North Korea has got rid of its nuclear weapons program unless they first know what is in the program. “The issue of the declaration is important because that which they declare must later be abandoned,” a senior administration official said. The official, who asked that his name not be used because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue, said that the administration really wanted North Korea to provide an explanation for purchasing aluminum tubes that could be used to convert uranium gas into nuclear fuel. In its Jan. 4 statement, North Korea accused the United States and the other countries in the six-party talks of reneging on promises made under an October deal, including the shipment of one million tons of fuel and the removal of North Korea from the United States’ list of states that sponsored  terrorism. So far, North Korea has received about 150,000 tons of fuel, and Bush administration officials say the removal of the North from the terrorism list will depend on whether it meets the requirements of the October deal. North Korea agreed in October to dismantle   its nuclear facilities and to disclose all of its past and present nuclear programs by the end of 2007 in return for 950,000 metric tons of fuel oil or its equivalent in economic aid. Last month, Mr. Bush reached out directly for the first time to the North Korean leader,  Kim Jong-il, holding out the prospect of normalized relations with the United States if North Korea fully disclosed all nuclear programs and got rid of its nuclear weapons.

To the Editor: Re “Philharmonic Agrees to Play in North Korea” (front page, Dec. 10): The Philharmonic’s decision to play in Pyongyang is a brazen act that shows how music remains a powerful tool of communication. Let’s hope that this trip will create more room for dialogue between North Korea and the rest of the world. Looking at the long-term benefits, it’s difficult to concur with the arts critic Terry Teachout’s conclusion that the Philharmonic “will be doing little more than participating in a puppet show whose purpose is to lend legitimacy to a despicable regime.” The Philharmonic has more potential to engender mediation than a plethora of pertinacious talk or bombs would. And since this trip is intended to foster openness, in addition to playing Western works the Philharmonic should play some North Korean music. A cup of coffee with Kim Jong-il could turn sour, but North Korean tunes might help enliven the situation. Patrick Kabanda Andover, Mass., Dec. 10, 2007 The writer is the school organist and a music instructor at Phillips Academy.  To the Editor: As the most important orchestra in America, the New York Philharmonic is automatically one of the truly great symbols of Western civilization — a civilization that values reason, science, individual rights and artistic freedom. So it is appalling that the leadership of the Philharmonic has chosen to defile and devalue that great symbol by placing it in the service of one of the world’s bloodiest dictators. As the musicians are giving their usual world-class performance in a comfortable venue, North Korean children will be dying of starvation — a starvation that is the direct and inevitable result of having been denied their inalienable rights by the tyrant Kim Jong-il. There is a disturbing pattern emerging. First, New York University prohibited a student group from displaying the famous Danish cartoons. Then Columbia University invited President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran to visit the campus and present his views in a respected forum. Now we have the New York Philharmonic helping the North Korean regime to paint itself with a thin veneer of civilization. One by one, New York’s institutions are betraying the very culture on which their existence depends. Greg Elmlinger New York, Dec. 10, 2007  To the Editor: While the New York Philharmonic is to be congratulated for its historic coming trip to North Korea, I despair that our cultural policy toward Cuba must remain in the dark ages. When inaugurating the administration’s Global Cultural Initiative, Laura Bush stated that “one of the best ways we can deepen our friendships with the people of all countries is for us to better understand each other’s culture by enjoying each other’s literature, music, films and visual arts.” Our present policies deny such possibilities of friendship and cultural sharing with Cuba, and it’s time to change.

Margareta Wahlstrom, the deputy emergency relief coordinator at the United Nations, said 58,000 homes had been destroyed along with nearly 222,400 acres of farmland, leaving 300,000 people homeless. She said 83 people were dead and about 60 missing. The United Nations said its relief officials in the region had reported that flood waters had wrecked more than 800 public buildings, 540 bridges, 70 stretches of railway and more than 500 electricity towers. More than 30 water reservoirs and 450 agricultural structures were damaged, it said. World Food Program officials planned to travel today to 10 hard-hit counties to assess immediate needs.

North Korea said that its dispute with the U.S. over $25 million frozen in a bank in Macao had been resolved, and that it would begin to shut down its main nuclear plant.

SEOUL, South Korea, June 25 —North Koreasaid Monday that its dispute with the United States over $25 million frozen in a bank in Macao had been resolved, and that it would begin to carry out its much-delayed promise to shut down its main nuclear plant. The first test of the North Korean commitment to stop and seal its main nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang, the capital, and an adjacent fuel-reprocessing plant, will come when officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency begin five days of negotiations on Tuesday in North Korea. The agency, the United Nations’ nuclear monitoring arm, and North Korean officials  will discuss a timetable for shutting down the reactor and technical details of monitoring and verification. Ever since the first suspicion of a North Korean nuclear weapons program surfaced in the early 1990s,  the agency and North Korea have bickered over how much access the agency should have to  nuclear facilities and data in the isolated country. “As the funds that had been frozen at Macao’s Banco Delta Asia have been transferred as we demanded, the troublesome issue of the frozen funds is finally resolved,” the official North Korean KCNA press agency quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying. “We too will start implementing the Feb. 13 agreement on the principle of action for action.” In the agreement reached in February with the United States and four other countries, North Korea promised to close the Yongbyon nuclear plant, which, according to American intelligence estimates, has produced enough plutonium for as many as a half dozen bombs. To ensure that North Korea keeps its promise, the United States made several concessions. It agreed to release the $25 million in North Korean funds, even though  the United States Treasury had blacklisted the bank in Macao as a main conduit of money-laundering  for North Korea. It also made a point of transferring the money to other North Korean accounts because the North wanted the United States to treat it as part of the international banking system. Then, Christopher R. Hill, the main American negotiator with North Korea on the issue, went to Pyongyang last week in part to show that the Bush administration, which once called North Korea part of an “axis of evil,” was treating it like a serious negotiating partner. The United States had promised to release the money by mid-March and in return North Korea  promised to shut down the reactor by mid-April. But the process took  longer than expected because few banks wanted to touch the money. Finally, Dalkombank, of Russia,  agreed to act as an intermediary. It said Monday that the money had been transferred to the Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea. North Korea said it would use the released money “for improving the standard of people’s living and humanitarian purposes,” as the United States demanded. But neither North Korea nor the United States elaborated on how to check whether the promise would be kept.

The U.S. hopes to get North Korea to begin to dismantle its nuclear arms program by releasing $25 million in frozen assets.
==::==

==::==
WASHINGTON, June 11 — The United States appears to be close to reaching a deal to transfer $25 million in frozen funds toNorth Korea, with Russia and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York acting as intermediaries, in hopes of getting North Korea to begin to dismantle its nuclear arms program, American officials said Monday. The funds have been frozen for nearly two years at a bank that the Bush administration has labeled a violator of American money laundering laws. Because of that label, the bank is barred from doing business with any bank in the United States. The bank,  Banco Delta Asia, is based in Macao, a semiautonomous region in China. It has been accused by the United States of helping North Korea finance its nuclear arms program, and carrying out counterfeiting and narcotics activities. In February, North Korea agreed to begin dismantling its nuclear program in return for several political and economic concessions, including the return of its frozen funds. It also insisted that the money being routed through an international bank in a transaction be in dollars. Major banks that were asked to facilitate the deal balked, however, and the money remained frozen. North Korea then continued to refuse to shut down its main nuclear plant, which the United States says is processing fuel for nuclear bombs. Several banks in China and the United States, including Wachovia Bank, refused to carry out the transaction. They cited a ruling by the Treasury Department in March that barred American banks from facilitating dollar transactions with the Macao bank. Recently,  a Russian bank agreed to be the vehicle for the transaction, American officials said, provided that it could obtain dollars to carry it out. With American laws barring American commercial banks from supplying the dollars, officials turned to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to facilitate the deal with North Korea. “The United States is working with Russian and Macanese authorities to facilitate the transfer” of North Korean funds that were previously frozen at Banco Delta Asia, said Molly Millerwise, a Treasury Department spokeswoman. “We appreciate the willingness of the Russian government to facilitate this transaction and the good cooperation of the Macanese authorities.” The Wall Street Journal reported details of the proposed deal on Monday. American officials said because the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was not a private bank, but part of the Federal Reserve system, it was not subject to American laws barring commercial transactions involving illicit funds. The system is independent of the government but run by presidential appointees. Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs, has said that as soon as the money is transferred to North Korea, the United States would demand that North Korean fulfill the commitments it made in February. The Bush administration has come under criticism, especially from conservatives, for making the deal with North Korea. Many of the critics charge that American officials were too trusting of the North’s intentions. North Korea agreed to disable its nuclear facilities in a deal with the United States, China, Russia, Japan and South Korea. The failure to unfreeze the $25 million has been frustrating to the Bush administration for weeks. In April, a senior Treasury delegation failed to get the money transferred after 13 days of talks in Beijing.

The agreement clears the way for talks to focus on implementing a nuclear disarmament accord.

BEIJING, March 18 — The United States andNorth Koreahave resolved a standoff over North Korean funds frozen in a bank account in Macao, clearing the way for talks to focus on implementing a nuclear disarmament accord, Chinese and American officials said today. Christopher Hill, an assistant secretary of state who is the chief American envoy at the talks, said he met with representatives from the North Korea delegation over the weekend to explain the American position on $25 million in North Korea-related accounts  in Macao’s Banco Delta Asia. An 18-month investigation into the bank ended last week, putting responsibility for returning the funds to North Korea in the hands of the authorities in Macao. But funds connected to illegal activities, like money laundering, counterfeiting, and narcotics and weapons trafficking, are not supposed to be returned. North Korean officials have said several times in recent days that they will not move forward with their commitment to shut down Yongbyon by mid April unless they recover the $25 million.North Korean officials have sent mixed signals about whether the Treasury Department action satisfies their demands to end the dispute. Senior officials in Pyongyang have not yet indicated that they consider the Macao matter to be resolved. But the issue “will not be an impediment to our six-party talks,” Mr. Hill told reporters. The North Korean officials “made it very clear that they have begun their tasks for the purpose of denuclearization.” Chinese State Councilor Tang Jiaxuan told a group of visiting Japanese lawmakers today  that the United States  and North Korea had  resolved the dispute, Hidenao Nakagawa, secretary-general of Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party, told reporters. The United States, North Korea, China, Russia, South Korea and Russia reached an initial agreement on Feb. 13 that gave North Korea 60 days to shut down its facility for producing plutonium for nuclear weapons at Yongbyon in return for aid and security pledges. The six parties will convene on Monday in the Chinese capital to hammer out details of that agreement and establish working groups to discuss a variety of other diplomatic and security concerns. Daniel Glaser, a Treasury department official, completed talks on Saturday with banking authorities in Macao, who operate under Chinese sovereignty,   and traveled to Beijing today  to hold discussions about the financial issue. Meanwhile, Mr. Hill said he hopes to set up a working group to examine the delicate issue of whether North Korea has been seeking to make nuclear fuel from a second source, highly enriched uranium, as well as its better known effort to use plutonium for the same purpose. Bush administration officials initially raised allegations that the North had a clandestine uranium program underway in 2002, citing intelligence from Pakistan, which American officials said may have sold equipment for enriching uranium to North Korea. The allegations were one of the factors that led to a collapse of an earlier agreement to freeze North Korea’s plutonium program. North Korea in October exploded its first nuclear device, which was made using plutonium. Pyongyang has denied that it has sought to build bombs using highly enriched uranium, but North Korean officials have said recently that they are willing to discuss the matter with the United States.

Negotiators will consider a draft agreement that promises rare but limited steps toward curbing the North’s nuclear ambitions.

BEIJING, Friday, Feb. 9 (Reuters) — The prospect for progress  toward endingNorth Korea’s nuclear arms program brightened on Friday as negotiators considered a plan for the country  to suspend operations at its nuclear facilities within two months. The  Kyodo news agency in Japan  said the proposal, drafted by China after the first day of six-country talks in Beijing, would help the North meet its  needs for more energy  in return for concessions on its nuclear program. The reported  progress in the talks among  the two Koreas, China, the United States, Japan and Russia came after American   and North Korean negotiators held pathbreaking direct  talks in Berlin last month. Their meetings cooled tension that had grown  after North Korea  staged its first nuclear test blast in October and the United Nations responded with sanctions. Envoys to the new talks, which began Thursday, voiced hope that North Korea would accept measures to rein in its nuclear activities in return for aid and security assurances, as outlined in a deal that was hammered out in 2005 but never carried out. “We’ve gone 18 months without anything, and so we have to pick up the pace,”  the chief American  negotiator, Assistant Secretary of State Christopher R. Hill, told reporters just before the talks resumed on Friday. Citing unidentified United States  officials, NBC News reported that North Korea was offering to suspend and eventually disable its nuclear program and permit United Nations  inspections of facilities. In turn, the North  wants diplomatic relations with the United States, an end to United Nations  sanctions and hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel aid, NBC reported. In Beijing, Japan’s chief negotiator, Kenichiro Sasae, said the six sides still had much ground to cover. “It’s too early to discuss whether the draft agreement is acceptable, as each country is to present its ideas and I believe China has its own ideas,” Mr. Sasae told reporters. South Korea’s envoy, Chun Yung-woo, also  sounded a note of caution. The draft was a “fine one” as a basis for discussions, Mr. Chun told reporters, adding, “I don’t want to prejudge whether the discussions will be smooth.” North Korea’s envoy, Kim Kye-gwan, told the delegates on Thursday that his country  was “ready to make its first step” toward denuclearization, Russia’s Interfax reported, quoting an unidentified source close to the negotiations.

The $2.7 million in programs that will go forward are those that directly benefit the people of North Korea, officials said. The action followed complaints from the United States and Japan that some money could be diverted to the government, a claim that North Korea dismissed as “ridiculous and nonsense.”.

Analysts noted the significance of seeing Kim Jong-il and his son at a military event, as the regime tries to create an image of Kim Jong-un as a capable military leader.
==::==

==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — The North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, watched a live-fire military exercise with his youngest son and heir apparent in what was believed to be the first public appearance ofKim Jong-unsince he wasgiven the rank of four-star generallast week. The North’s official Korean Central News Agency reported on Tuesday that the two Kims were joined by other members of their family and senior officials in the new North Korean leadership. The location and date of the drill were not specified. But it was significant, analysts in Seoul said, that the younger Mr. Kim’s first public event was a military exercise, as the government tries to create the image of him as a capable military man. The event also was likely to reinforce his father’s guiding “military first” philosophy. Kim Jong-un, who is believed to be 27 or 28, was joined at the drill by Vice Marshal Ri Yong-ho, the chief of the army’s general staff, the news agency said. Both men were appointed last week as deputy chairmen of the party’s military commission, and South Korean analysts expect Vice Marshal Ri, 67, to tutor the inexperienced Mr. Kim on military and political matters as Mr. Kim prepares to eventually succeed his father. The news agency report said that when the elder Mr. Kim signaled for the live-fire drill to begin, “various ground guns showed powerful fire, while units moved in close harmony to annihilate enemies.” Also watching the military exercise were two other members of Kim Jong-il’s ruling inner circle — his sister, Kim Kyong-hui, who  was also made a four-star general last week, and her husband, Jang Song-taek, long rumored to be effectively in charge of the daily running of the government. It was unclear whether the military exercises were part of the preparations for a nationwide celebration of the 65th anniversary of the founding of the Workers’ Party. The anniversary, Oct. 10, is a major annual holiday inNorth Koreaand usually features food giveaways by the government and a huge military parade in the capital, Pyongyang. The South Korean Defense Ministry also said on Tuesday that the North seemed to be preparing a large set of war games involving army, air force and naval units. Those exercises are expected to be held at sea, off North Korea’s eastern coast. In a separate news agency report, North Korea assailed the “ceaseless war exercises being staged by the U.S. imperialists” against the North “in league with the South Korean war hawks.” The United Sates and South Korea recently concluded five days of antisubmarine drills off the South Korean coast. The statement said that such moves would only heighten tensions between the Koreas, and that the United States was an “archcriminal” that wanted to “spark off a war on the Korean Peninsula.”

The entities are the General Bureau of Atomic Energy, which oversees the nuclear program, and the Korea Tangun Trading Corporation, thought to support the North’s missile programs.

SEOUL —North Korea’s announcement on Friday that its experiment in enriching uranium is at “completion stage” marks the strongest signal yet from Pyongyang that it is racing to develop a second method of making nuclear bombs. North Korea also said it was building additional nuclear bombs with plutonium it had recently gleaned from its reactor in Yongbyon. It said it had completed reprocessing the latest batch of spent fuel unloaded from the reactor, repeating the procedure believed to have given the North enough plutonium for six to eight bombs. For years, officials in Washington and elsewhere have debated whether North Korea was pursuing a clandestine uranium-enrichment program. After years of denial, North Korea announced in April that it intended to enrich uranium. In June, it said its enrichment program was in an “experimental stage.” On Friday, it provided an update on its progress, highlighting its nuclear card at a time when Washington’s special envoy on North Korea, Stephen Bosworth, is on a high-profile trip to Northeast Asia to consult with its allies on how to force North Korea to give up itsnuclear weaponsprograms. “Experimental uranium enrichment has successfully been conducted to enter into completion phase,” the state-run Korean Central News Agency, or K.C.N.A., reported, quoting what it said was a letter the North Korean government had sent to the United Nations Security Council in response to a request for information. “Reprocessing of spent fuel rods is at its final phase and extracted plutonium is being weaponized.” The letter, whose full text was carried on K.C.N.A., gave no details. But the use of the word “experimental” suggested the country was still short of running a full-scale enrichment program. South Korean officials have said they believe North Korea first acquired uranium-enrichment technology from Pakistan. A facility that produces highly enriched uranium for weapons requires the costly installation of thousands of centrifuges. But unlike plutonium, uranium can be enriched in relatively small and inconspicuous facilities, such as an underground factory, experts said. “Our intelligence authorities will try to verify the North Korean claim, but it won’t be easy,” said Won Tae-je, a spokesman for the Defense Ministry in Seoul. He said the North’s claim could also be “just rhetoric for negotiations.” The existence of a second program to make bomb fuel would give North Korea something else to negotiate with the West. More difficult to detect or monitor than its plutonium counterpart, a uranium program poses a bigger challenge to Western officials who fear North Korea could sell such technology abroad, as it has sold some of its reactor technology to Syria. In its letter to the Security Council, North Korea also said, “We are prepared for both dialogue and sanctions.” After months of raising tensions with a long-range rocket launching in April and a nuclear test in May, North Korea has made a series of conciliatory gestures toward the United States and South Korea in recent weeks. It released two American journalists in August and agreed to hold reunions later this month of Korean families separated by the Korean War. But these gestures have not been answered with an invitation to direct talks with the United States, as North Korea has requested, nor a easing of international sanctions, which appears to have frustrated the North’s leaders, said Ryoo Kihl-jae, a North Korea expert at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. Washington and its allies insist that Pyongyang return to six-nation talks, which also include China, South Korea, Russia and Japan, in discussions on ending the North’s nuclear weapons programs. “Impatience is the word that first came to my mind when I read the statement and the North’s recent moves,” he said. “They are almost begging for dialogue.” Kim Yong-hyun, a North Korea specialist at Dongguk University, said he felt the North was trying to assert itself in an effort to raise the stakes in the region as Mr. Bosworth talks with allies. In Beijing on Friday, Mr. Bosworth said the North Korean action “reconfirms the necessity to maintain a coordinated position on the need for complete, verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” Reuters reported. In Tokyo, the Japanese foreign minister, Hirofumi Nakasone, said his government “will definitely not tolerate North Korea possessing nuclear weapons.” And Moon Tae-young, a spokesman for the South Korean Foreign Ministry, said: “We will deal with North Korea’s threats and provocative acts in a stern and consistent manner.” North Korea on Friday reiterated that it quit six-nation talks because they were used for “wanton violation” of its “sovereignty and right for peaceful development,” and called again for direct talks with Washington. “We have never objected the denuclearizing of the Korean Peninsula,” K.C.N.A. quoted the letter as saying. “It depends strictly on the United States’ nuclear policy on Korea.”

There are reasons to negotiate with North Korea, but diplomats will never get the regime to give up its nuclear weapons.

Bill Clinton’s trip to Pyongyang and the release of the American journalists  confirmed what many observers have suspected since early July: North Korea is indicating its willingness to re-start talks with the United States. There are reasons why Washington should not  rush to the negotiation table immediately, but few people doubt that these talks will start relatively soon. The negotiations are likely to be characterized as talks about getting the North to give up its nuclear weapons. But one should not be misled: No amount of diplomatic dealing can achieve that goal. North Korea’s leaders have good reasons to retain their nuclear program. First, they need a deterrent against foreign attack. Second, they need nuclear arms for domestic purposes: The nuclear weapons program is perhaps the only visible success of Kim Jong-il’s rule. (It also serves as a helpful  excuse for the regime’s economic calamities). But, above all, the nuclear program is  a powerful diplomatic tool. North Korea cannot survive without foreign aid,  which the regime uses to support those social groups whose loyalty is vital for  internal stability. And  nothing can rival a latent nuclear threat as means to obtain foreign aid. It is often argued that North Korea might choose to surrender its nuclear weapons in exchange for a massive aid program. But Pyongyang cannot use the aid to kick-start its economy, because its leaders believe that economic reforms will be politically ruinous.  Chinese-style reforms require a great deal of political liberalization.  The spread of  information about South Korea’s economic success and political freedom would deliver a mortal blow to the regime’s legitimacy. In this situation, the most rational policy choice of the tiny Pyongyang elite  is to avoid domestic reforms, keep interaction with the outside world at a bare minimum and, of course, engage in  nuclear blackmail. The regime can alternate threats  with hints at a possible solution, and even make promises of a complete de-nuclearization at some future point. The North has played this game for nearly two decades,  with remarkable success. As long as the country remains under  the current regime’s control,  negotiations are not going to produce a non-nuclear North Korea. Nevertheless, there are at least four major reasons why North Korea should be engaged. First, some useful compromises are achievable. It is possible to devise an agreement that would diminish the likelihood of nuclear proliferation by Pyongyang. After all, North Korean leaders understand that their current stockpile of weapons-grade plutonium is sufficient as a deterrent and blackmail tool, so additional production would not make much difference. They might even agree to demolish their Yongbyon research facilities, if the promised payoff is sufficiently high. Second, talks lessen tensions and decrease the likelihood of a confrontation. Of course, Pyongyang diplomats might at any time resort to their favorite trick: Walk away from negotiations, launch a chain of provocations to increase tensions, and then return to negotiations in expectations of greater payoffs. But while talks are continuing, an accidental confrontation is less likely. Third, talks will provide a line of communication that might become vital, since big changes are looming in Pyongyang: Recent photos leave no doubt that Kim Jong Il’s health has deteriorated considerably. Perhaps the most important reason why Pyongyang should be engaged is the long-term domestic impact of talks. Negotiations and aid create an environment where contacts between the isolated population  and the outside world steadily increase, exposing the total lie in which North Koreans have to live. In the long run, this  will undermine the regime, bringing the country’s radical transformation  —  and, probably, a solution of the nuclear issue. Nonetheless, future talks should be conducted without unrealistic expectations. There will be no breakthrough as long as the present regime runs the country. To keep Pyongyang engaged, something has to be given, but excessive generosity is not advisable: It will merely provoke more exercises in blackmail. There  also is no need to  hurry. It’s time to realize that the North Korean problem has no quick fixes, but  it can  —  and should  —  be managed.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreatest-fired four short-range missiles into the sea that lies between it and Japan on Thursday, amid simmering tensions over the latest international sanctions against the Communist state, according to news reports and a spokesman for the South Korean government. North Korea fired two missiles from a base near Wonsan, a major city on the North’s east coast, at 5:20 p.m. and at 6 p.m. local time, said a spokesman at the South Korean Defense Ministry who spoke on condition of anonymity because a formal announcement had not been made yet. Later Thursday, the North fired another short-range missile, the spokesman said. The South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that a fourth short-range missile was also fired. The spokesman did not provide additional details, but Yonhap called the weapons surface-to-ship cruise missiles and reported that each flew about 60 miles before falling harmlessly into the sea. While such missiles are routinely tested by the North Koreans, they raised speculation that North Korea might launch a long-range ballistic missile in defiance of a United Nations ban, further heightening regional tensions after the North’s last long-range rocket launching on April 5 and its nuclear test on May 25. The latest missile launchings had been expected, as North Korea declared a no-sail zone last month in waters off its east coast through July 10. News media reports have said that North Korea may launch a barrage of missiles on July 4 to highlight its provocative stance. The North tested a long-range missile on that day in 2006. The missile tests came as Philip Goldberg, an American special envoy who is  coordinating sanctions against the North, was scheduled to meet Chinese officials in Beijing. He is seeking support in carrying out the new sanctions outlined in a United Nations resolution passed after the North’s recent nuclear test. The resolution also demanded that the North stop testing ballistic missiles. The new sanctions allow nations to hail a North Korean vessel suspected of carrying weapons and force it into port for an inspection. In recent weeks, an American Navy ship has been trailing a  a North Korean freighter, but the vessel  reportedly turned around in Southeast Asian waters,  aborting  what was believed to have been a voyage to Myanmar. The North Korean ship, which American officials suspect was sent out as a ruse, is the first vessel monitored under the new United Nations sanctions, which were adopted after the North’s nuclear test. Meanwhile, North and South Korea failed on Thursday to resolve a dispute over fees paid at a joint factory park in the North where South Korean firms hire cheap North Korean labor. The park is a major source of cash for the North.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreaannounced Saturday that it had begun reprocessing thousands of spent nuclear fuel rods, adding that it would use plutonium extracted from the rods to makenuclear weapons. Reprocessing the rods, which were unloaded from the nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, 60 miles north of Pyongyang, the capital, “will contribute to bolstering the nuclear deterrence for self-defense in every way to cope with the increasing military threats from the hostile forces,” an unidentified North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman told the nation’s official news agency. Reassembling the partly disabled Yongbyon complex to its operational state could take at least several months. But experts and officials in Seoul have said that North Korea could have quickly reopened the reprocessing plant to produce plutonium from thousands of spent fuel rods. Experts say that the rods can yield enough plutonium for one or two bombs. The announcement came hours after the United Nations Security Council placed three North Korean companies on a United Nations blacklist for aiding North Korea’s missile and nuclear programs. North Korea flouted international warnings and launched a long-range rocket on April 5. That has since led to a string of international actions and North Korean reactions. On April 13, the Security Council unanimously condemned the rocket launching, widely seen as a test of long-range ballistic missile technology, and called for tightened sanctions against North Korea. North Korea insists that the rocket launching was part of a peaceful space program. In response to the Council’s actions, North Korea has expelled United Nations  monitors and quit  talks aimed at getting the North to dismantle its nuclear facilities. It also vowed to restart its nuclear weapons program, which had been frozen under a deal with the United States, China, South Korea, Japan and Russia. Hours before the North Korean announcement on Saturday, the Security Council’s sanctions committee announced a list of goods to be denied to North Korea and North Korean entities to be blacklisted under Security Council Resolution 1718, which was passed in 2006 after the North’s nuclear test.

The indictment of the journalists, who have been detained for more than five weeks, comes amid high tension after the North launched a rocket on April 5.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreasaid Friday that it had decided to indict two American journalists who have been detained for more than five weeks on charges of illegally entering the country and committing “hostile acts.” “Our related agency has completed its investigation of the American journalists,” North Korea’s state-run news agency, KCNA, reported. “It has formally decided to put them on trial based on confirmed criminal data.” The reporters, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, work for Current TV, a San Francisco-based media company founded by Al Gore, the former vice president.They were arrested by the North Korean military on March 17on the border between China and North Korea. They had been in China reporting on the North Korean refugees who fled hunger at home and were living in hiding in China. Ms. Ling, 32, is the younger sister of Lisa Ling, a television journalist who reported undercover in North Korea for National Geographic in 2006. In the piece, “Inside North Korea,” Lisa Ling posed as part of a medical team that used a hidden camera; her report exposed some of the hardships of living in North Korea and criticized the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il. She had gained prominence as a co-host on the talk show, The View, from 1999 to 2002, and has since been a contributor for the Oprah Winfrey Show and National Geographic. Lisa Ling has not commented on her sister’s capture.  A message to Mr. Gore’s spokeswoman on Friday was not immediately returned. In addition, Current TV has removed content relating to the capture of Ms. Ling, a reporter, and Ms. Lee, an editor, on its web site. On Friday, Doug Ling, who lives in Carmichael, Calif., and raised Lisa and Laura as a single father, would say only that “We hope, wait and pray.” Ms. Lee has been a video and film editor in San Francisco and, according to her web site is linked with a partner, Michael Saldate, who is an actor and stand-up comic. When reached on Friday, Mr. Saldate also said he could not comment. A Facebook group with about 2,400 members has sprung up to show support for the women and members have pledged to hold several rallies: one at the MSNBC studios in New York next month and two next Tuesday, one outside Current TV’s office in San Francisco and the other at the high school that Laura Ling attended in California. The North Korean news agency, KCNA, did not say specifically what charges the journalists will face. But North Korea officials said on March 31 that the reporters would be indicted on charges of “illegal entry” and perpetrating “hostile acts” against the Communist state. Their indictment comes amid high tension between North Korea and the United States after the North launched a long-range rocket on April 5. The United States pressed the United Nations Security Council to call for tightened sanctions on the North. In return, Pyongyang told the United Nations’ nuclear monitors last week to leave the country and vowed to quit six-nation talks on dismantling itsnuclear weaponsfacilities. It threatened, too, to restart a plant that makes bomb-grade plutonium. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov confirmed on Friday that North Korea had withdrawn from the talks. North Korea “is not prepared to return to the negotiating table now,” Mr. Lavrov said at a news conference in Seoul following a visit to Pyongyang earlier this week. “Our common goal is to provide conditions in which the resumption of the negotiations would be possible,” he said. The six-party talks on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula involve North Korea, South Korea, Russia, the United States, Japan, and China. After Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee were arrested under circumstances that are still unclear, they appear to have become part of the political standoff between the governments in Pyongyang and Washington, analysts said, with North Korea likely to use their trial as political leverage against the United States. The United States does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea, but a Swedish diplomat based in North Korea has met with the two American journalists on Washington’s behalf. They are being are held in Pyongyang, the capital. North Korea has said that it would allow the reporters consular access and treat them according to international law. Amnesty International has said it doubted that they will receive a fair trial, given the North Korean judicial system’s lack of independence or transparency. North Korea also has detained a South Korean worker in a joint industrial complex in the North for almost a month on charges of denouncing the North Korean regime.

Following is the text of President Obama’s statement Sunday on North Korea’s rocket launching, as released by the White House: North Korea’s development and proliferation of ballistic missile technology pose a threat to the northeast Asian region and to international peace and security.  The launch today of a Taepo-dong 2 missile was a clear violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718, which expressly prohibits North Korea from conducting ballistic missile-related activities of any kind.  With this provocative act, North Korea has ignored its international obligations, rejected unequivocal calls for restraint, and further isolated itself from the community of nations. We will immediately consult with our allies in the region, including Japan and the Republic of Korea, and members of the U.N. Security Council to bring this matter before the Council.  I urge North Korea to abide fully by the resolutions of the U.N. Security Council and to refrain from further provocative actions. Preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery is a high priority for my administration.  The United States is fully committed to maintaining security and stability in northeast Asia and we will continue working for the verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula through the Six-Party Talks.  The Six-Party Talks provide the forum for achieving denuclearization, reducing tensions, and for resolving other issues of concern between North Korea, its four neighbors, and the United States.  North Korea has a pathway to acceptance in the international community, but it will not find that acceptance unless it abandons its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and abides by its international obligations and commitments.

SEOUL, South Korea — Determined to demonstrate its latest missile technology both to its adversaries and perhaps to potential buyers in the Middle East,North Koreapressed ahead with final preparations on Friday to launch a multistage rocket. The countdown could begin as early as Saturday morning, and North Korea says its rocket will blast off sometime between then and Wednesday. It warned aircraft to stay clear of its easterly trajectory over northern Japan, toward the Pacific. Weather forecasts say it will be cloudy with no strong winds over the Musudan-rilaunching siteon North Korea’s coast, meaning the North could launch the rocket anytime during the period. “I think it’s almost certain North Korea will fire the missile,” President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea said Friday in London, where he was attending the Group of 20 summit meeting, Reuters reported. Mr. Lee vowed a “strong and stern response.” North Korea says it is launching an experimental communications satellite. But Washington and its allies see the test as a provocative demonstration of ballistic missile technology and an attempt to secure a place on President Obama’s crowded foreign policy agenda. North Korea began fueling the rocket on Thursday. Neighboring governments were on heightened alert on Friday, and had navy ships with missile-tracking radar deployed in waters near North Korea. For its part, the North reportedly moved fighter jets closer to the launching site and threatened to counterattack if any government tried to stop it. “It’s too early to say for sure whether the object the North is launching is a satellite or a missile,” said Lee Jong-joo, a government spokeswoman in Seoul. “But our principled position is that whether this is a missile or something else, it threatens peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.” Unable to persuade the North to cancel its plan, Washington, Tokyo and Seoul focused on how to forge a unified front with China and Russia in penalizing the North, while also drawing it back to six-nation talks on ending itsnuclear weaponsprogram. North Korea is banned from ballistic missile tests under two United Nations Security Council resolutions, which were adopted in 2006 after it launched a ballistic missile and conducted its first nuclear test. But if North Korea puts a satellite into orbit — as it claims it wants to do, and as a growing number of analysts believe it will try to do — then any attempt to introduce new sanctions will be hobbled by disputes over whether the North violated the 2006 resolutions, analysts said. In Strasbourg, France, Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesman, said the launching would be a violation of Security Council resolutions, and said “preparations” were being made if it went ahead, Reuters reported. He did not provide details in comments to reporters during a trip to Europe by Mr. Obama. Prime Minister Taro Aso of Japan told China’s president, Hu Jintao, during the Group of 20 summit meeting that if the launching went ahead, there should be a new United Nations resolution, the Yomiuri newspaper reported. Mr. Hu showed “some understanding” but did not made a clear commitment, the newspaper said. For the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, who reportedly suffered a stroke in August, a successful launching would demonstrate his country’s mastery of crucial missile technologies. Mr. Kim is also using the tensions he has stirred up to rally his hungry people amid dwindling foreign aid, and to demonstrate to the outside world that he is still in charge, analysts said. In a sales pitch for his missiles, Mr. Kim may also have invited arms dealers from the Middle East to the launching site, they said. “Evidence suggests that North Korea has had extensive dealings with Iran, Pakistan, Russia, Yemen and Libya on ballistic missiles and possibly even nuclear warheads,” said a recent report from the Congressional Research Service in Washington. Experts believe that the rocket North Korea is about to launch is derived from itsTaepodong-2 missile, which the North began developing in the 1990s. But they are not sure about its potential or the North’s ability to arm missiles with nuclear warheads. The Congressional Research Service report said some analysts believed that the Taepodong-2 missile could deliver a 1,500- to 2,200-pound payload more than 4,000 miles, within range of the Alaskan coast, as well as all American military targets in Japan and Guam. The North Korean rocket would weigh about 80 tons and could place a payload of 100 kilograms, or 220 pounds, into orbit at about 250 miles, David Wright, co-director of theUnion of Concerned Scientists’ Global Security Program, wrote recently , citing some inconclusive assumptions. When used as a missile, the same rocket could carry a 500-kilogram, or 1,100-pound,  payload about 5,600 miles, far enough to reach San Francisco. But “since it likely would be difficult for North Korea to build a first-generation warhead and heat shield with a mass of 500 kilograms, this wouldn’t represent a true intercontinental nuclear capability,” Mr. Wright wrote. The North’s first test of the Taepodong-2 missile failed in 2006 when it blew apart 40 seconds after launching.

SEOUL  —North Koreaannounced Tuesday it was preparing to send a satellite into orbit in what American  and South Korean officials believe will be a provocative test of a  long-range missile capable of reaching parts of North America. The  announcement came only days after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and South Korea’s foreign minister, Yu Myung-hwan, urged the North  not to carry out the test, calling such a move “very unhelpful” and “provocative.” During her trip to  Seoul last week, Mrs. Clinton called the North Korean government’s rule “tyranny,” but offered to normalize ties and provide economic help if it abandoned its nuclear weapons program. Officials in the region were awaiting the North Korean response when the announcement came on Tuesday. “The preparations for launching experimental communications satellite Kwangmyongsong-2 by means of delivery rocket Unha-2 are now making brisk headway,” North Korea’s Committee of Space Technology said in a statement carried by the  government news agency, KCNA. The statement marked the first time North Korea had confirmed its activities at a missile-launching base at Musudan-ri on its east coast. It did not say when the launch would take place, but it was the  clearest sign so far that it may be imminent. In recent weeks, North Korea has said it has the right to launch a scientific satellite, an excuse, analysts in South Korea say, the North has adopted to avoid United Nations sanctions and any potential U.S. attempt to shoot down its missiles. “It’s really absurd and funny for North Korea, a country unable to feed its own people, to say it is developing a space program,” said Kim Tae-woo, a senior analyst at the government-funded Korea Institute for Defense Analysis. “I think a missile launch is imminent, with all major preparations completed.” A long-range ballistic missile carrying  a warhead and a rocket delivering a satellite are so similar that  experts said it was difficult to tell them apart until tracking technology detects a new satellite in orbit. The U.S. space authorities tried but could not find a new satellite after North Korea launched what it called its Kwangmyongsong-1  satellite in 1998. Western officials believed that it had actually tested its Taepodong-1 missile. At the time, North Korean media praised Kim Jong-il, who had been confirmed as the country’s top leader, for pioneering the country’s “space development program”  and  said the  satellite was broadcasting revolutionary Communist songs to earth. Mr. Kim is  expected to be reconfirmed as leader by the North’s rubber-stamp Parliament on March 8. Analysts in Seoul have  cited  the period around Mr. Kim’s re-election as a possible window for the North to launch a missile. In recent weeks, officials and experts in the region have feared that North Korea was readying to launch the multistage Taepodong-2, the North’s most advanced missile with an estimated range of 4,200 miles and capable of reaching Alaska. For decades, North Korea has tried to build nuclear weapons and missiles capable of delivering them, according to U.S. officials. After North Korea conducted its first nuclear test in 2006, the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution urging it to stop all ballistic missile-related activities. North Korea often uses its military threats to obtain concessions.  The  announcement Tuesday came just as Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso landed in Washington for a summit with President Obama.

Mr. Clapton,  known for his recordings of songs like  “Layla,” “Cocaine” and “Tears in Heaven,” is said to have at least one key fan in North Korea: Kim Jong-chol, a son of and possible successor to the nation’s  leader,Kim Jong-il. It is not certain that Mr. Clapton will accept the offer. “Eric Clapton receives numerous offers to play in countries around the world,” said a spokeswoman, Kristen Foster.  “There is no agreement whatsoever for him to play in North Korea.”

The deal sets a timetable for North Korea to disable all of its nuclear facilities in return for economic aid.
==::==
2007-10-04T00:00:00Z
==::==
WASHINGTON, Oct. 3 —North Koreahas agreed to disable all of its nuclear facilities by the end of the year, in a move that the Bush administration hailed as a diplomatic victory that could serve as a model for how to deal with Iran, which has defied American efforts to rein in its nuclear ambitions. The North Korea agreement, announced in Beijing on Wednesday, sets out the first specific timetable for the North  to disclose all its nuclear programs and disable all facilities in return for 950,000 metric tons of fuel oil or its equivalent in economic aid. The accord is the second stage of a six-nation pact reached in February, one that has continued to draw sharp criticism from conservatives who complain that the United States is rewarding North Korea for its test of a nuclear device last October. The agreement has not yet resolved the contentious question of when North Korea will give up its nuclear weapons. The agreement calls on the United States to “begin the process of removing” North Korea from a United States terrorism list “in parallel” with the North’s  actions. Conservative critics said the United States should not take North Korea off the terrorism list until it gave up all its nuclear weapons, and argued that the pact was far too conciliatory toward a nuclear power with alleged ties to international terrorism. But the Bush administration has been eager to show diplomatic progress, and President Bush suggested that the deal should serve as an example to Iran, which has refused to suspend its uranium enrichment program. During a town hall meeting on Wednesday in Lancaster, Pa., Mr. Bush told a questioner that he might hold direct talks with Iran if it first froze enrichment of uranium. “If your question is, ‘Will you ever sit down with them,’ we’ve proven we would with North Korea, and the answer is, ‘Yeah, just so long as we can achieve something, so long as we are able to get our objective,’” Mr. Bush said. John R. Bolton, the administration’s former ambassador to the United Nations, said the White House violated the original purpose of the diplomatic talks by agreeing to negotiate side agreements with North Korea about taking it off both the terrorism list and a second list of “enemy” nations forbidden from trading with the United States. “If they come off either or both lists, without any final verification of their performance on the nuclear issue, I think the president will have embarrassed his administration in history,” Mr. Bolton said. Critics of the White House, including some Democrats, note that the February accord bears a strong resemblance to the 1994 agreement between North Korea and the Clinton administration, one that Bush administration officials denounced in the past as a giveaway, and which fell apart in 2002. Conservatives are also angry that the United States went ahead with the agreement despite a recent Israeli airstrike in Syria that Israeli officials have said was directed at nuclear material supplied by North Korea. During meetings this past weekend, Christopher R. Hill, the chief United States negotiator, told North Korea that one of the things it must disclose were details of whatever nuclear material it had been supplying to Syria, two senior Bush administration officials said. Both officials, who asked that their names not be used because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the issue, said that North Korean officials denied giving Syria any assistance. “We did not achieve clarity on this issue, but that does not mean we do not intend to keep trying,” one of the officials said. “We aren’t operating on faith.” On Monday, the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad,  acknowledged for the first time that the Israeli incursion had been an attack, but said the target had been an empty warehouse. “They bombed a building, a construction, it’s related to the military but it’s not used,” Mr. Assad told the British Broadcasting Corporation. Under the agreement reached in February, North Korea has shut down its Yongbyon nuclear plant, which, according to American intelligence estimates, has produced enough plutonium for as many as a half-dozen bombs. This week’s agreement calls on the North to disable Yongbyon by the end of the year. Administration officials said they hoped that by disabling the facility, they would avoid a repeat of 2002, when North Korea shut down Yongbyon and then restarted the plant after talks broke down. “They were able to get the reactor up and running in two months,” a State Department official said. “By focusing on disablement, the hope is that the next interim measure is to do things to it so it can’t readily be turned back on.” The agreement on Wednesday is part of a larger pact between North Korea, China, Russia, South Korea, Japan and the United States — the so-called six parties that have been wrangling to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. Mr. Hill, the chief American negotiator, said the pact also called for the United States to give North Korea assistance with its energy sector. State Department officials said the first $25 million, equivalent to 50,000 tons of fuel aid, would be making its way to North Korea shortly. Mr. Hill said North Korea did not have enough room in its ports or oil depots to put up all of the fuel oil it had been promised, which was part of the reason why the countries would also give the North equivalent economic aid to help to build and improve energy plants and storage depots. The official joint statement is carefully worded on how or when North Korea will be taken off the terrorism list, reflecting the political delicacy, particularly in the United States, of the matter. In Washington, Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, said North Korea should remain on the list. “In 2005, we wrote a law specifically aimed at closing the door on the possibility of civilian nuclear cooperation between the U.S. and North Korea,” Mr. Markey said in a statement. “Given North Korea’s dangerous record of developing nuclear weapons, exporting advanced missile technology, engaging in international criminal activity, and engaging in international terrorism, that prohibition is just as necessary today as it was two years ago when the president signed it into law.”

New images of a North Korean nuclear site and a recent visit to the North by two American experts suggest new work was started on a nuclear reactor.

SEOUL, South Korea — New satellite images of a North Korean nuclear site and a recent visit to the North by two American experts suggest thatNorth Koreahas started work on a new reactor. The Institute for Science and International Security, a nuclear research group in Washington, said it had obtainedphotographsshowing “construction activity at the site of the destroyed cooling tower for the disabled reactor” at Yongbyon. Charles L. Pritchard, a former special envoy for negotiations with North Korea who is the president of the Korea Economic Institute, a policy group, toured the Yongbyon site during a five-day trip to North Korea this month. He said he was told by North Korean officials that they were building an experimental light-water reactor. Mr. Pritchard was accompanied bySiegfried S. Hecker,emeritus director of the Los Alamos Nuclear Laboratory. Mr. Hecker told the security institute that “the new construction seen in the satellite imagery is indeed the construction of the experimental light-water reactor.” Light-water reactors are typically used to generate electricity for civilian purposes and are considered relatively safe in terms of proliferation risks. Experts at the institute estimated that a new reactor with a capacity of about 30 megawatts would require several tons of low-enriched uranium to start up, and another ton every year as “reloads.” “These values could vary depending on the design of the reactor and whether it will be optimized for electricity production or weapon-grade plutonium production for weapons,” the security institute said in a report. The new structure — reinforced concrete foundations and a steel frame — was still in its early stages. The expected completion date would probably be before April 15, 2012, the 100th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il-sung, the founding president of the North Korean state. The South Korean Defense Ministry declined on Friday to comment on the reports. North Korea demolished the cooling tower at its five-megawatt gas-graphite reactor at the Yongbyon complex in 2008 as part of a denuclearization agreement. That accord was reached through the so-called six-nation talks with South Korea, China, Russia, Japan and the United States. The oldYongbyon reactor,which had been used to produce plutonium, remains inoperative, according to Mr. Pritchard, who met with North Korea’s chief nuclear envoy, Kim Kye-gwan, and the chief diplomat for United States affairs, Ri Gun. Mr. Pritchard has briefed American and South Korean officials about his trip.

North Koreaissued a lengthy rebuttal on Tuesday of the report of an international investigation that concluded that it had torpedoed a South Korean warship, theCheonan, in March, in an attack that killed 46 sailors. The National Defense Commission published a statement accusing the international investigation, which South Korea led and the United States participated in, of fabricating data. North Korea noted the inquiry’s conclusion that an aluminum torpedo sank the warship and said all of its torpedoes were made of steel alloy. It also said the “No. 1” marking that the investigation said was found on the torpedo parts was written in a style different from the one used in North Korea. South Korea countered that North Korea’s claims were not new.

The Sept. 28 meeting could signal the formal designation of Kim Jong-il’s son as his heir apparent.
==::==
2010-09-22T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreaannounced on Tuesday that the ruling Workers’ Party would hold a major gathering next week, the first such congress in 30 years and a meeting that could signal the formal designation ofKim Jong-il’s youngest son as his heir apparent. North Korea said the conference to elect the country’s “supreme leadership body” would be held in the capital, Pyongyang, on Sept. 28. “It’s not 100-percent certain, because North Korea remains a very special country, but I would say it’s 99-percent sure thatKim Jong-unwill be confirmed as the successor,” said Andrei Lankov, a North Korea expert at Kookmin University in Seoul. “He will be presented to the party and the people on the 28th as ‘the new genius of leadership, the guiding star of the 21st century,’ something like that.” North Korea had said earlier that the party congress would be held in early September, and political analysts in South Korea had floated all manner of theories to explain the delay. The North Korean announcement on Tuesday made no reference to the delay but said party delegates had been holding preparatory meetings around the country all month. The delay led to renewed speculation about Kim Jong-il’s health, focusing on a stroke he is believed to have suffered in 2008, and the continuing deterioration of his appearance as seen in official state photographs and video. There also were suggestions that Mr. Kim, 68, needed time to recover from a recent train trip to China where he met with senior officials. It was still unclear whether his son accompanied him to China as a way of being introduced to North Korea’s allies in Beijing. Some analysts also suggested that recent storms and flooding in the North had delayed the conference because it became difficult for party delegates to travel to Pyongyang. Another theory held that internal wrangling had caused the delay in the congress, and some suggested that there was discord among the political and military elite about a possible dynastic succession — from grandfather to father to son. But Mr. Lankov dismissed any idea of significant internal disputes, saying the delay in the conference was brief. “Maybe Kim Jong-il had a minor flu or something,” he said. Mr. Lankov and other analysts said the younger Mr. Kim will likely be given a Politburo post and perhaps a senior position in the government, although they did not expect he would be named as chairman of the all-powerful National Defense Commission. A parade and public gatherings are not expected in the North to celebrate Kim Jong-un’s emergence, analysts said, although his official portrait would perhaps soon be appearing in North Korean shops, offices, homes and public places. Poems and songs also will start to be heard, Mr. Lankov said, “along with stories about his greatness.” But some analysts were more cautious about Kim Jong-un’s prospects at the party meeting next week, suggesting the gathering will more likely introduce a party leadership that will help him solidify and expand his  base before he eventually inherits power. And even if he does receive significant appointments, these analysts said, the regime might refrain from announcing them right away. Mr. Kim was introduced to the nation — and to most of the outside world — at the last Workers’ Party conference, held in 1980. He took over from his father, Kim Il-sung, the founder of the modern North Korean state, upon his father’s death in 1994. That passage of power came gradually and peacefully, with the son undergoing years of grooming, study and tutelage. Kim Jong-un has had no such training — political or military — and he remains something of a cipher. “He doesn’t know much about anything,” Mr. Lankov said. Very few pictures of him are known to exist in public, even in North Korea, and even his age is uncertain — 27 or 28. He attended a private school in Switzerland for a time, and it is believed that he speaks English. Kim Jong-il’s former sushi chef, who wrote a memoir in 2003, said in an interview last year that as a teenager, Kim Jong-un was already his father’s favorite son and “looked just like him.” Intelligence officials in Seoul and Washington have tried in the past year — with mixed results — to compile a dossier on Kim Jong-un to better understand the potential future leader of a nuclear-armed state. He is described as a man of medium height, and a bit overweight, with high blood pressure and perhaps diabetes. He is, the reports suggest, very much like his father, the so-called Dear Leader. “We picture a charismatic young man, authoritarian, politically astute and precocious and ambitious,” Cheong Seong-chang, a researcher at the Sejong Institute, near Seoul, said at the time. “We picture Little Kim Jong-il.”

North Korea’s ruling party will hold its biggest meeting in decades, the Workers’ Party conference, on Sept. 28 in Pyongyang to choose new leadership, state news media reported Tuesday. An heir to the dynasty of the current leader,Kim Jong-il, left, who is thought to have suffered a stroke in 2008, is likely to be chosen at the conference. Analysts say the heir is expected to be a son of Mr. Kim,Kim Jong-un, who will be given an official title. The meeting was to have started in early September, but the report by the state-run Korean Central News Agency made no mention of the delay.

In Seoul on Monday, Robert Einhorn vowed to ratchet up pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons.

SEOUL, South Korea — After meeting Monday with South Korean officials, American officials elaborated on Washington’s intention to increase pressure on foreign banks and businesses that helpNorth Koreain illicit activities. The action raised the possibility that the tough new measures would mirror those that escalated tensions in the region five years ago, contributing to the North’s test-firing of an intercontinental missile and testing of anuclear devicein 2006. Washington will soon announce a new list of entities and individuals involved in arms trading, counterfeiting American currency, drug trafficking and other illicit activities that provide North Korea with “hundreds of millions of dollars annually,” Robert Einhorn, the State Department’s special adviser for nonproliferation and arms control, said at a news conference here after meeting with South Korean officials. On a visit here last month, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clintonannouncedthat the United States would impose new financial penalties on the North in the wake of thesinking of a South Korean warshipin March that killed 46 sailors. A South Korean-led investigation found that a North Korean torpedo had split the ship in two. Mr. Einhorn said that Washington was seeking to block access by members of the blacklist to property or assets under the control of a United States citizen or bank. The move is an effort to cut off the money that international intelligence officials say is used to help the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, finance his country’snuclear weaponsprogram and bribe his party and military elite with luxury foreign goods. “By publicly naming these entities, these measures can have the broader effect of isolating them from the international financial and commercial system,” Mr. Einhorn said. “Those entities don’t have to be all North Korean.” Daniel Glaser, the Treasury Department’s deputy assistant secretary for terrorist financing and financial crimes, who was also in Seoul for the meetings, compared the new measures to the Treasury’s2005 move to blacklist Banco Delta Asia, a bank in the Chinese territory of Macao with links to North Korea. That move angered North Korea more than any other. About $24 million of North Korea’s money at Banco Delta was effectively frozen, and financial institutions around the world were loath to deal with Pyongyang for fear they would also be blacklisted and denied access to the international banking system. “We have seen on prior occasions how powerfully the private sector reacts to U.S. actions that expose entities that facilitate North Korea’s illicit activities,” Mr. Glaser said. In 2005, North Korea considered the American actions a plot to topple its government, and it boycotted six-nation talks on ending its nuclear weapons program. The next year, North Korea launched a Taepodong-2 long-range missile and conducted its first nuclear test, prompting the United Nations Security Council to tighten sanctions further. North Korea returned to talks only after Washington promised to release the frozen  money. Mr. Einhorn said Washington was concerned about a global network of trading firms using aliases, subsidiaries and front companies to flout international sanctions and carry on proliferation-related activities. He said the United States would urge other nations to press banks to freeze those companies’ accounts, noting that similar pressure was being brought to bear on Iran. North Korea and Iran are Washington’s two biggest concerns regarding nuclear proliferation. “One means of addressing these challenges is to increase the pressures felt by these two governments so that they recognize that it is in the best interests of their countries to meet their international obligations and forsake nuclear weapons,” Mr. Einhorn said. Though North Korea suffers from sanctions that already exist, it tends to grow more belligerent under pressure. China has weakened the sting of some sanctions, intervening with emergency aid to forestall instability in North Korea and avert a crisis at the border between it and the North.

Sentenced to eight years in a North Korean labor camp, a man from Boston attempted suicide, state media reported.

SEOUL, South Korea — An American serving an eight-year sentence in a labor camp inNorth Koreahas been hospitalized after trying to kill himself, the North’s state-run Korean Central News Agency reported on Friday. The suicide attempt by the American, Aijalon Mahli Gomes, 30, from Boston, who was arrested in North Korea in January, was “driven by his strong guilty conscience” and “his frustration with the U.S. government’s failure to free him,” the news agency said. The Swedish Embassy in North Korea, which has had consular access to Mr. Gomes on behalf of Washington, was aware of his condition, the agency said. The United States and North Korea do not have diplomatic relations. In April, North Korea sentenced Mr. Gomes to eight years of hard labor and fined him the equivalent of $700,000 for entering the country illegally and for “hostile acts.” North Korea recently threatened to increase the punishment for Mr. Gomes under the country’s “wartime law,” saying worsening tensions with the United States had created a warlike situation on the Korean Peninsula. Mr. Gomes’s motivation for entering North Korea is unclear. He had been teaching English in South Korea before his arrest in the North. In late April, he was allowed to speak to his mother by telephone. While in South Korea, Mr. Gomes had attended rallies calling for the release of Robert Park, a fellow Christian from the United States who crossed into North Korea from China in December to call attention to the dismal conditions in the North’s prison camps. Mr. Park was expelled from North Korea after about 40 days. Last year, North Korea also arrested two American journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, and sentenced them to 12 years of hard labor for illegally entering the North. But the women were pardoned andreleasedfive months later after former President Bill Clinton visited North Korea and its leader, Kim Jong-il.

The elevation of Kim Jong-il’s brother-in-law to the No. 2 post is another sign that the ailing leader is engineering a dynastic succession of power to his third son. 
==::==

==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — As its leader,Kim Jong-il, was watching,North Korea’s rubber-stamp Parliament fired its prime minister and elevated his brother-in-law to the government’s No. 2 post on Monday in a sweeping government reshuffle. Analysts said the changes were aimed at defusingpublic angerover a disastrous revaluation of its currency while consolidating Mr. Kim’s power at a time of considerable turmoil. Underlining their urgency, analysts said, Parliament was convened for the second time in two months, even though it normally meetsonly once a year. Mr. Kim, who is believed to be in failing health, is grappling with two daunting tasks simultaneously. He is trying to engineer a succession of power to his third son, Kim Jong-un, 27. And he is also struggling to provide for the  needs of his people, who have suffered years of food shortages and the near collapse of the centrally planned economy. Those goals were thrown further into doubt when he suffered a stroke in 2008 and a series of economic initiatives produced financial and social unrest.  He is also facing a strong international backlash over a torpedo assault on a South Korean warship in March, an attack that some analysts suspect was carried out by North Korea to show that the country can remain defiantly militaristic despite its troubles. In the session on Monday, the Supreme People’s Assembly fired Prime Minister Kim Yong-il, who reportedly madea rare apologyin February for the decision to slash the value of the North’s currency to fight inflation, a move that wiped out most savings and created social chaos. Mr. Kim, a technocrat, was replaced by Choe Yong-rim, a Workers Party insider and a confidant of Kim Jong-il’s family. Several other economic ministers were replaced Monday, said the North’s official news agency, K.C.N.A., a sign of the decreasing influence of technocrats as the Workers Party reasserted itself in favor of socialist state control of the moribund economy, analysts said. North Korea has vowed to eradicate the private markets, which are technically forbidden but have flourished since the famine of the mid-1990s. At the personal recommendation of Mr. Kim, Parliament also elected Jang Song-taek, his trusted brother-in-law, to the No. 2 post at the National Defense Commission, the North’s highest ruling agency, led by Mr. Kim himself. Mr. Jang, 64, the husband of Mr. Kim’s sister, Kim Kyong-hee, is in charge of public security and is widely seen as a key player in ensuring the transfer of power to the leader’s son. He may even lead a collective caretaker government if Mr. Kim dies before his son is firmly in control in Pyongyang, the North’s capital, or is seen as too young to lead a power hierarchy dotted with octogenarians, analysts said. “North Korea is reshaping its cabinet in the face of public resentment following the botched currency reform,” said Kim Yong-hyun, a North Korea analyst at Dongguk University in Seoul. “By personally attending the parliamentary session and calling for Jang Song-taek’s appointment, Kim Jong-il made his brother-in-law the official manager of the power succession.” With his new post, Mr. Jang has become “the No. 2 man, in both responsibility and influence,” said Yang Moo-jin, a North Korea analyst at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. Mr. Jang’s expanding influence coincided with what analysts said was Kim Jong-il’s growing dependence on his trusted relatives. Mr. Kim, 68, is still believed to make the decisions in Pyongyang, but he was visibly weakened after his 2008 stroke, raising doubts about whether he could live long enough to secure a transfer of power. Mr. Jang’s status became more prominent after Ri Je-gang, 80, another senior party official who was believed to be a main engineer of the power transfer,died in a traffic accident last week. Kim Jong-il’s top policy is to build a militarily “strong” and economically “prosperous country” by 2012,  when the North is widely expected to announce itself as a full-fledged nuclear power and formally appoint the son as heir. But the secession is unfolding amid widespread discontent over economic hardships.  The currency devaluation in November, to fight inflation and crack down on the black markets, prompted sporadic and highly unusual outbursts of discontent as it drove merchants away from the markets and made it harder for people to find food. “I offer a sincere apology about the currency reform as we pushed ahead with it without sufficient preparation, and it caused a great pain to the people,” Kim Yong-il, the departing prime minister, said at a meeting of party members in Pyongyang in February, South Korean news media reported at the time, quoting unnamed sources inside the North. In March, North Korea executed its top financial official, Pak Nam-gi, holding him responsible for the currency devaluation, according to South Korean news reports. On Monday, three deputy prime ministers were fired and six were appointed. The new ministers of the mechanical and electronics industries will double as deputy prime ministers, reflecting North Korea’s promise to emphasize those industries. The technocrats who now seem to have fallen from favor reportedly backed a Chinese-style economic reform. For years, the government turned a blind eye to the private markets, which traded in homegrown food and daily necessities smuggled from China, helping North Koreans supplement their meager state rations. But those markets emerged as a serious threat to the government’s  totalitarian control by creating a new moneyed class and spreading news from the outside world. The government’s  dilemma over economic reform has made the prime minister’s post a precarious one. Over the years, a few prime ministers have been fired either for failing to solve the economic problems or for pushing too hard for market-oriented changes.

A missionary carrying a letter for the North Korean dictator crossed into the country to try bring attention to North Korean suffering, South Korean activists said.

==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — An American missionary carrying a letter for the North Korean dictator crossed illegally into the reclusive country to try bring international attention to the North Korean suffering, South Korean activists said Saturday. “I am an American citizen,” Robert Park, 28, said as he crossed the frozen river separating China fromNorth Koreaon Friday, according to Jo Sung-rae, head of Pax Koreana, a conservative civic group based in Seoul. “I am coming here to deliver God’s love. God loves you.” By early Sunday, there was no word of his fate from North Korea. Before heading to China last week to make the journey, Mr. Park said he was determined to become a “martyr” for the tens of thousands of people said to be incarcerated in North Korea’s infamous concentration camps, Mr. Jo said. In a videotaped message he made before the trip, Mr. Park said he wanted to be arrested and had no intention of leaving North Korea voluntarily until it shuts down its camps. He also said he did not want President Obama to “buy his freedom.” In August, former President Bill Clinton led a delegation to Pyongyang to negotiatethe releaseof Laura Ling and Euna Lee, American journalists who were detained in North Korea for nearly five months after crossing the river border illegally. After a prayer on the banks of the Tumen River, Mr. Park, a Korean-American missionary from Tucson, Ariz., entered North Korea amid heavy snow at 5:01 p.m. on Christmas Day, repeatedly shouting his message in Korean, Mr. Jo said. Mr. Park was carrying a letter addressed to the North Korean rulerKim Jong-il, asking him to open his borders so that aid can be brought in and to “close down all concentration camps and release all political prisoners.” A copy of the letter was posted on Pax Koreana’sWeb site. His venture could complicate Washington’s diplomacy, which has focused mainly on coaxing the North Korean government regime to return to six-nation nuclear disarmament talks. The government considers any outside criticism of its top leader a grave challenge. North Korea’s criminal code calls for punishing illegal entry with up to years of hard labor. Ms.  Ling and Ms.  Lee, the American journalists, were sentenced to 12 years of hard labor for trespassing and “hostile acts.” Mr. Park crossed the border near the northeastern North Korean city of Hoeryong, Mr. Jo said. North Korea holds about 160,000 political prisoners in a network of prison camps across the country, according to South Korean and American government estimates based on testimonies from former inmates. North Korea denies their existence, but several former inmates who have escaped to the South reported harsh labor, inadequate food and arbitrary killings in the camps. Mr. Park was known among Christian activists in Seoul for giving away his coats to homeless people in Seoul. Friends here said he had worked as a missionary in Mexico, caring for homeless people there, before moving to China last year to help and proselytize to North Korean refugees there. Last July, he moved to South Korea, saying that God gave him a vision for “North Korean liberation.” “He was such a passionate Christian,” said Suh Suk-koo, a South Korean member of the American-Korean Friendship National Council, a Virginia-based civic group founded by Korean-American Christians in the United States. “He said it was time to revive the spirit of early Christian martyrs who were not afraid of being eaten by lions during the Roman rule.”

The U.S. envoy is on a mission to halt the North’s reactivated nuclear weapons program and persuade it to return to nuclear disarmament talks.
==::==
2009-12-09T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — President Obama’s special representative toNorth Koreaarrived in Pyongyang, the North’s capital, on Tuesday, the highest-level American official visit in more than a year. The rare trip is part of an effort to halt the North’s reactivatednuclear weaponsprogram and persuade the North Koreans to return to nuclear disarmament talks. The visit by the representative,Stephen W. Bosworth, signaled a new phase in United States diplomacy toward North Korea. For months, the United States had focused on punishing North Korea, leading an international campaign to enforce sanctions imposed on it for testing a long-range rocket in April and detonating a nuclear device in May. Mr. Bosworth is the most senior American official to visit North Koreasince October 2008, when Christopher R. Hill, who was then an assistant secretary of state, met North Korean officials in Pyongyang. Mr. Bosworth flew from a United States air base south of Seoul. Later, a one-line dispatch from the North’s official Korean Central News Agency confirmed his arrival. He is scheduled to return to Seoul on Thursday. His two-day stay in South Korea this week had been shrouded in secrecy as both Seoul and Washington struggled to resolve what analysts perceived as a division over how to deal with North Korea. Members of the conservative government of President Lee Myung-bak have questioned the wisdom of sending a high-level American envoy to North Korea without waiting for international sanctions to weaken the North’s bargaining power. “South Korea fears that Bosworth’s trip can create a split in the international efforts to put pressure on the North through sanctions,” said Chang Yong-seok, an analyst at the Institute for Peace Affairs, in Seoul. “The rift may grow, depending on the outcome of his trip.” Mindful of this concern, Washington emphasized that Mr. Bosworth was traveling with a narrow agenda: determining whether the North planned to return to six-nation nuclear talks and to recommit itself to a 2005 pledge to give up its nuclear assets in return for aid and security guarantees. “We don’t intend to reward North Korea simply for going back to doing something that it had previously committed to do,” a senior American official said in Washington during a background briefing on the eve of Mr. Bosworth’s trip. But Mr. Bosworth’s visit was bound to include discussions on what rewards the North could expect if it returned to the talks and proceeded with denuclearization. North Korea wants a peace treaty with Washington and an end to what it calls a “hostile” United States policy before it considers giving up its nuclear weapons capacity. As a first step, the North is likely to demand talks on normalizing ties with Washington, analysts in Seoul said. The offer would be difficult for Washington to resist if such talks were conditioned on freezing the North’s nuclear programs, said Mr. Chang and Chon Hyun-joon, an analyst at the government-run Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul. Washington wants to freezeNorth Korea’s nuclear weaponsprograms and bring the North back into the fold of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty while the United States grapples with the war in Afghanistan andIran’s nuclear program. But so far, United States-led sanctions have failed to tame the North. Rather, the North Koreans have declared that they turned more plutonium into atomic bombs and started a new uranium-enrichment program for possible weapons. Mr. Chang said that establishing a diplomatic foothold in North Korea — like a liaison office as a preliminary step toward a full diplomatic mission — could serve Washington amid uncertainty over the health of Kim Jong-il, the North Korean leader, and the prospects of his government. With the North Korean economy in tatters, Mr. Kim, for his part, needs a diplomatic victory as he plans to hand over power to one of his three sons. The potential for Mr. Bosworth’s visit to restart talks between the United States and North Korea has been regarded cautiously by the government in Seoul. “Fundamentally, it doesn’t really matter whether Bosworth goes to Pyongyang or whether North Korea returns to six-party talks,” said a senior South Korean official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the political delicacy of the issue. Playing down the significance of Mr. Bosworth’s trip, the official added: “What matters is whether the North Koreans are willing to give up their nuclear weapons. We think they won’t, unless they feel enough pain.” President Lee has repeatedly emphasized that the United States and its allies should avoid “repeating the past pattern” of not punishing the North sufficiently for violating its pledges and of allowing it to use international talks as a tool to extract aid while it retains its nuclear weapons.

Now that President Bill Clinton has extricated Laura Ling and Euna Lee from North Korea, the hard work begins. There are new indications that North Korea may be transferring nuclear weapons technology to Myanmar, the dictatorship also known as Burma, and that it earlier supplied a reactor to Syria. For many years, based on five visits to North Korea and its border areas, I’ve argued for an “engagement” approach toward Pyongyang, but now I’ve reluctantly concluded that we need more sticks. Burmese defectors have provided detailed accounts of a North Korean reactor, perhaps a mirror of the one provided to Syria, built inside a mountain deep in Myanmar. The reports,first aired in The Sydney Morning Heraldthis month, come from Desmond Ball, a respected Asia scholar, and Phil Thornton, a journalist with expertise on Myanmar, and there has been other fragmentary intelligence to back them up. If the defectors’ accounts are true, the reactor “could be capable of being operational and producing a bomb a year, every year, after 2014,” Mr. Ball and Mr. Thornton wrote. The suspicions may be false, and Iraq is a reminder that defector reports about W.M.D. can  be wrong. But partly because the North Korean reactor in Syria (destroyed by Israeli bombing in 2007) caught intelligence agencies by  surprise, everyone is taking the latest reports seriously. Secretary of State Hillary Clintonexpressed concernabout the transfer of nuclear technology from North Korea to Myanmar, without giving details. All this was eerily foreshadowed by the North Koreans themselves. Michael Green, who ran Asian affairs for a time in the Bush White House, says that in March 2003, a North Korean official  — with hands shaking  — read out to him and other American officials a warning:We have a nuclear deterrent. If you don’t end your hostile policy, we will demonstrate, expand and transfer it. “They’ve done all those things,” Mr. Green notes. At times in the past, there seemed hope for diplomacy  aimed at coaxing North Korea into giving up its nuclear program and joining the concert of nations. These days that seems virtually hopeless. “Formal diplomatic engagement aimed at rolling back their nuclear program has run its course, at least for the time being,” says Mitchell Reiss, a North Korea expert and former senior State Department official who is now at the College of William and Mary. “The facts have changed. You have to change your strategy.” In the past, Mr. Reiss focused on engagement. Now he advocates “hard containment”  — toughened sanctions backed by military force if necessary. The truth is that North Korea doesn’t want to negotiate away its nuclear materials. It is focused on its own transition, and this year it has declined to accept a visit from the Obama administration’s special envoy, Stephen Bosworth. The North isn’t interested in “six-party talks” on nuclear issues; instead, it seeks talks with the U.S. conditioned on accepting North Korea’s status as a nuclear power  — which is unacceptable. In recent months, North Korea has dismantled some economic reforms and economic cooperation projects with South Korea. Meanwhile, it continues to counterfeit U.S. $100 bills  — the highest-quality goods that North Korea manufactures  — and its embassies in Pakistan and other countries pay their way by smuggling drugs, liquor and currency. The North has released its American hostages but continues to hold South Koreans. And it’s the most totalitarian state in history: In North Korean homes, I’ve seen the “speaker” on the wall that wakes people up with propaganda each morning. More bizarre, triplets are routinely taken from parents and raised by the state because they are considered auspicious. There are no good options here, and a grass-roots revolution is almost impossible. North Koreans, even those in China who despise the regime, overwhelmingly agree that most ordinary North Koreans swallow the propaganda. Indeed, Kim Jong-il’s approval rating in his country may well be higher than President Obama’s is in the United States. Our best bet will be to continue to support negotiations, including a back channel that can focus on substance instead of protocol, as well as economic and cultural exchanges  — but backed up by sticks. The Obama administration is now working with allies to reimpose economic and financial sanctions that a few years ago were very successful in squeezing the North Korean regime. China is surprisingly cooperative, even quietly intercepting  several shipments of supplies useful for W.M.D. programs. Where we have intelligence that North Korean ships are transferring nuclear materials or technology to a country like Myanmar or Iran, we should go further and board those vessels. That’s an extreme step, but the nightmare would be if Iran simply decided to save time and buy  a nuclear weapon or two from North Korea. We can’t allow that to happen.

Companies involved with the North’s missile program risk having any American assets frozen and being barred from dealings with businesses in the United States.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) — The United States said Tuesday that it had cracked down on companies involved inNorth Korea’s missile program and in purchases of equipment that could be used in anuclear weaponsprogram. The Treasury and State Departments said they had singled out  Hong Kong Electronics of Iran and  Namchongang Trading Corporation of North Korea under an executive order that would freeze any American assets and ban American companies from dealing with them. It was not immediately clear if either company had American assets, but the move appeared aimed at isolating them from other countries’ banks and corporations that may resist dealing with them for fear of running afoul of American laws. North Korea conducted itssecond nuclear testthis year and has ceased following terms of a 2005 accord to abandon its nuclear program in exchange for economic and diplomatic benefits. The Treasury Department said that it had singled out Hong Kong Electronics, which is located on Kish Island, Iran, because it had transferred millions of dollars of “proliferation-related” funds to North Korea from Iran. “North Korea uses front companies like Hong Kong Electronics and a range of other deceptive practices to obscure the true nature of its financial dealings, making it nearly impossible for responsible banks and governments to distinguish legitimate from illegitimate North Korean transactions,” Stuart Levey, under secretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a  statement. The State Department described Namchongang as a “nuclear-related company” based in Pyongyang, the North’s capital.

Two American journalists were scheduled to go on trial on Thursday inNorth Korea, in a case widely seen as a test of how far it was willing to take its confrontational stance toward the United States. But by late Thursday, there was no word on whether the trial had begun. The two Americans, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, ofCurrent TV, have been held in North Korea for more than two months on charges of illegal entry and “hostile” acts.

SEOUL —  Two American journalists who have been detained inNorth Koreafor two months on charges of illegal entry and “hostile acts” will be put on trial June 4, the Communist North announced on Thursday. The reporters, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, were arrested by the North Korean military on March 17 on the border between China and North Korea. They had been in China reporting on North Korean refugees for Current TV, a San Francisco-based media company founded by Al Gore, the former vice president. In announcing the trial date, the North’s state-run news agency, KCNA, gave no further details, such as what charges they faced. But Pyongyang had earlier said that it found evidence of illegal entry and unspecified hostile acts. Under North Korea’s criminal code, a person convicted of hostile acts against the state can face at least five years in labor camps. Illegal entry carries a sentence of up to three years in a labor camp. The trial comes amid heightened tension between North Korea and the United States after the North launched a long-range rocket on April 5. The United States pressed the United Nations Security Council to tighten  sanctions on the North. In retaliation, Pyongyang expelled United Nations nuclear monitors, and threatened to restart a plant that makes weapons — grade plutonium and to conduct a nuclear test. News of the trial   date came just days after  Iran released an Iranian-American journalist sentenced to eight years in prison on charges of spying for the United States. The journalist, Roxana Saberi, was released Monday after an appeals court reduced her original sentence to a two-year suspended sentence.

United Nations nuclear experts left North Korea on Thursday, after the country’s decision this week to expel them amid escalating tensions over the North’s recent missile launching. The inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency left the Yongbyon nuclear plant after removing the seals on equipment and switching off surveillance cameras, the agency said in a statement. North Korea has also ordered out four United States experts monitoring the Yongbyon plant, and they were preparing to depart in the next several days, the State Department said.

Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said the United States would act to pre-empt a North Korean missile only if it were headed toward U.S. territory.

WASHINGTON — The United States has no plans for military action to pre-empt the launching of a long-range missile byNorth Koreaand would act only if the missile or its parts appeared to be headed toward American territory, Defense SecretaryRobert M. Gatessaid Sunday. The description by Mr. Gates of a calibrated military response was the most definitive to date as the international community, led by the United States, Japan and South Korea, pursues diplomatic action to press North Korea not to proceed with the launching of aTaepodong-2intercontinental ballistic missile. Mr. Gates’s comments came as senior administration officials, led by President Obama, took to the Sunday talk shows to describe thestrategy unveiled Fridayto focus American counterterrorism efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan. A range of administration officials repeated that the United States would strike at high-value terrorist and insurgent targets inside Pakistan, but only after consultations with the government there. The officials said the United States had no intention of sending combat troops onto Pakistani territory. But since the Afghanistan-Pakistan strategy will require months to be put into effect, the prospect of a long-range North Korean missile launching as early as this week generated a more immediate national security risk. North Korean officials have said the launching is designed solely to push a satellite into orbit. Although the peaceful, commercial and scientific use of space is protected under international law, a United Nations Security Council resolution specifically bars North Korea from testing missiles and nuclear devices. Mr. Gates said on “Fox News Sunday,” “I don’t know anyone at a senior level in the American government who does not believe this technology is intended as a mask for the development of an intercontinental ballistic missile.” Even so, Mr. Gates said the United States had no plans to take military action to halt the launching or to shoot down the missile in flight — with one exception. “If we had an aberrant missile, one that was headed for Hawaii, that looked like it was headed for Hawaii or something like that, we might consider it,” Mr. Gates said. One of America’s closest allies in the region, Japan,  has authorized its military to shoot down any debris from the rocket that might fall toward its territory, and has joined the United States and South Korea in saying the launching is a cover for testing technology for a long-range missile that could carry a nuclear warhead. All three countries have demanded that North Korea cancel the launching but have conceded there is little they can do to force acceptable behavior on the isolated government in Pyongyang, beyond threatening even more sanctions. American officials acknowledge that the launching would be the first major test for Mr. Obama in dealing with North Korea’s ambitions to field long-range missiles andnuclear weapons. In battling terrorists in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the president, appearing on the CBS program “Face the Nation,” said the United States would respect Pakistani sovereignty but reserved the right to strike at important terrorist targets, after consultations with the government in Islamabad. “If we have a high-value target within our sights,” Mr. Obama said, “after consulting with Pakistan, we’re going after them.” But he stressed that those attacks would not be with American ground forces, implying that he was referring to continued strikes from the air. The American commander in the region, Gen. David H. Petraeus, appeared on CNN’s “State of the Union” and explained that “there is no intention for us to be conducting operations in there, certainly on the ground, and there is every intention by the Pakistani military and their other forces to conduct those operations.” Richard C. Holbrooke, the president’s top adviser on Afghanistan and Pakistan, said on CNN that success required overcoming tensions between Washington and Islamabad, and he cited what senior Pakistani officials have labeled “the trust deficit.”

North Korea told international aviation authorities that it would launch a satellite in early April, according to the North’s official media.
==::==

SEOUL —North Koreahas informed international authorities that it will launch a satellite in early April, firing a three-stage rocket that can also be used to deliver a warhead as far as the American mainland, South Korean officials said Thursday. The notification is the latest in a series of warnings and signals North Korea has given in recent weeks about such a launch. Washington and Seoul have warned that such a “provocative” launching flouts a 2006 United Nations resolution and could invite more sanctions from the Security Council. Pyongyang provided the International Civil Aviation Organization, the International Maritime Organization and others with “necessary information for the safe navigation of planes and ships,”  on the expected launch dates, the North’s state-run Korea Central News Agency said on Thursday. That report did not say when the launch would take place. But the South Korean government said that North Korea had informed the London-based International Maritime Organization on Wednesday that its rocket will blast off between April 4 and 8 to put an experimental communications satellite into orbit. Neighboring governments believe that the real purpose of launching a satellite will be the testing of the North’s Taepodong-2 intercontinental ballistic missile. “Whether the rocket is for a missile or satellite, it’s the same technology,” said Unification Minister Hyun In Taek of South Korea said on Thursday. “So we consider this a missile in essence and a violation of the U.N. resolution.” A successful launching of the rocket would demonstrate the North’s missile prowess to a region that has grown increasingly uneasy over its long-range and nuclear threats. It is also designed to humiliate South Korea, which is still months away from launching its own first, two-stage, space rocket launch. North Korea gave the International Maritime Organization two map coordinates  — one in the sea between North Korea and Japan and the other in the Pacific  — where its spent engines were expected to be jettisoned, said Park Young Sun, a South Korean government official. This means North Korea plans to launch a three-stage rocket, said Sohn Young Hwan, a rocket technology expert at Technovalue, a defense technology consulting firm in Seoul. On Feb. 24, North Korea announced that it planned to put its satellite, the Kwangmyongsong-2, or Lodestar-2, into orbit. In 1998, North Korea claimed it put its first satellite, Kwangmyongsong-1, into orbit, but the United States and South Korea never spotted it circling the earth and cited the launch as a test of the Taepodong-1 long-range missile American officials are braced for a launch. “The North Koreans announced that they were going to do a space launch, and I believe that that’s what they intend,” National Intelligence Director Dennis Blair told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday. “And if a three-stage space launch vehicle works, then that could reach not only Alaska, Hawaii but also part of what the Hawaiians call ‘the Mainland’ and what the Alaskans call ‘the Lower 48,’” he said. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has said “a range of options,” including further actions from the Security Council, could be taken against North Korea if the country fires a missile. On Thursday, North Korea said it had recently joined two U.N. conventions on the peaceful use of space. The move was designed to deflect international outcries against the rocket launch, said Moon Tae Young, spokesman of the Foreign Ministry of South Korea. The belligerent North has recently escalated its provocative rhetoric against the outside world. Experts see the stream of threats in large part as an attempt to get the attention of the United States and force South Korea to soften its policies on the North and provide aid.

SEOUL —North Koreaelected its rubber-stamp parliament on Sunday in a poll that outside observers monitored closely for signs of a shift in the isolated Communist regime’s power structure. With the election of delegates to the Supreme People’s Assembly, North Korea laid the ground for a new five-year term for its leader,Kim Jong Il. The first task when the new Assembly convenes in the coming weeks will be to re-elect Mr. Kim as chairman of the National Defense Commission, an event that analysts in the region say the North will likely celebrate with the launching of its longest-range missile, the Taepodong-2. At Mr. Kim’s behest, the new parliament may also replace members of his cabinet and the National Defense Commission, the top ruling agency. North Korea watchers will scrutinize a new lineup for any sign that Mr. Kim is preparing to name a successor from one of his three known sons or is favoring a collective leadership of political and military advisers. Soldiers in uniform and civilians in their holiday costumes, dancing and singing, queued up at voting stations across the country, the North’s state-run media said. They voted under the portraits of Kim and slogans avowing loyalty to his leadership. In the previous poll in 2003, the country reported a 99.9 percent voter turnout and total support for the single candidate running in each of the country’s 687 constituencies, all hand-picked by Mr. Kim. This year’s poll is the first since Mr. Kim, 67, reportedly suffered a stroke last August. Elections scheduled for that month were postponed while he disappeared from the public eye. Although he has since re-emerged, his illness sparked wild speculation in the region about whether Mr. Kim has decided to start grooming a son as the next leader for the dynastic and nuclear-armed Communist regime. On Sunday, North Korean media cited an election-day poem that urged North Koreans to rally around the “bloodline of Mt. Paekdu,” a common reference to Mr. Kim’s family. Although such phraseology is part of North Korea’s usual propaganda, it assumed added significance, given recent unconfirmed news reports in South Korea that Mr. Kim’s youngest son, Kim Jong Un, 26, had been chosen to succeed his father and was running in Sunday’s election. North Korea was pushing ahead with the parliamentary elections as the U.S.S. John C. Stennis, anAmerican aircraft carrier, sailed to South Korean waters and thousands of American troops prepared to land for an annual joint military exercise that begins on Monday with the South Korean military. North Korea sees the war game as preparation for an invasion. It warned last week that it could not guarantee the safety for South Korean passenger jets flying near its airspace during the military drill, forcing several airlines to redirect their flights. South Korean officials suspected that North Korea may be clearing airspace before it launches its Taepodong-2. North Korea has said it was planning to send up a communications satellite, but its neighbors believe the launching will be a disguise for a missile test. President Barack Obama’s special envoy for North Korea, Stephen W. Bosworth, arrived in Seoul on Saturday. He said Washington is “reaching out now” to the North to persuade it not to launch a missile and to return to nuclear disarmament talks. Official resultsesults of Sunday’s ballot are expected to be released Monday. Kim Jong Il, a parliamentary member, was running this year in the constituency No. 333  — an auspicious choice because the number three is considered to bring luck among Koreans, the North’s state-run media said. “With this fortunate number, we will become a country strong in all three aspects:  in politics, military and economy,” said Tongil Sinbo, a state-run North Korean weekly.

The test did not mean that a missile test was imminent, but it showed that North Korea was defying a U.N. resolution by continuing to develop its Taepodong missile series.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreacarried out a rocket engine ignition test for a long-range ballistic missile at a previously unknown missile launching site this year, according to unconfirmed reports in South Korean news media on Tuesday. The engine test did not mean that a missile test was imminent. But it showed that North Korea was defying aUnited Nationsresolution by  continuing to develop its Taepodong missile series. When those missiles are fully operational, they would apparently be capable of reaching the West Coast of the United States. It is unclear whether North Korea has mastered the technology needed to arm its rockets with nuclear warheads. Its last Taepodong missile test, conducted in 2006, was considered a failure, with the rocket fizzling out 40 seconds after blastoff from the North’s east coast. It is also unclear whether the North Koreans know how to shrink a nuclear weapon enough to fit it on a Taepodong warhead. Jane’s Defense Weekly reported last week that North Korea was building a larger missile base on its west coast, near the border with China. The base is about a year from first-stage completion, Jane’s  said, quoting analysis from commercial satellite images. Chosun Ilbo, South Korea’s largest newspaper, quoted an unidentified South Korean government official on Tuesday as saying that an American satellite had detected the testing of the Taepodong engine at the site on North Korea’s west coast. Yonhap, South Korea’s leading news agency, quoted an unidentified official as saying that the engine test occurred in May or June. On Tuesday, The Associated Press carried a similar report, quoting an anonymous American official. The State Department and the South Korean government declined to confirm the reports. “Any ballistic missile tests of the kind reported would not be permitted under 1718,” Sean McCormack, the State Department spokesman, told reporters, referring to the United Nations resolution condemning North Korean tests of ballistic missiles and components. The Security Council adopted the resolution after North Korea set off an underground nuclear explosion in October 2006. Meanwhile, Bush administration officials said they were still trying to determine the severity of the stroke that North Korea’s leader,Kim Jong-il, apparently suffered in August.

President Bush’s comments raise the prospect of new delays in the dismantling of North Korea’s nuclear program.

BANGKOK —  In remarks delivered  on the eve  of the Olympic Games in Beijing, President Bush said Thursday that he had “deep concerns” about basic freedoms in China and he criticized the detention of dissidents and believers, even as he praised the extraordinary gains China had made since he first visited more than three decades ago. Mr. Bush’s comments distilled and recast earlier statements critical of China’s record on human rights.  But with his speech, which also addressed other issues in Asia and was presented  only hours before he was to fly to Beijing, the president sent  a rebuke to China’s leaders, though a measured one. “I have spoken clearly and candidly and consistently with China’s leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights,” he said. “And I have met repeatedly with Chinese dissidents and religious believers.” “The United States believes the people of China deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings,”  Mr. Bush  said. “So America stands in firm opposition to China’s detention of political dissidents, human rights advocates, and religious activists.” The White House released a draft of the speech on Wednesday in part to draw attention to Mr. Bush’s concerns for the rights of Chinese, a spokesman said. But the speech  mentioned neither the Olympics nor the specific abuses that have resulted in new international criticism of the Chinese government. With Mr. Bush’s planned attendance at the  Games prompting debate and criticism, the White House has sought to strike a balance between expressing support for advocates of greater political and personal freedom in China and cultivating cooperation with China’s government on a host of trade and security issues. Mr. Bush has faced pressure from Congress and from international advocacy groups to speak more forcefully or risk being seen as lending credibility or respectability to a government that restricts the freedoms that the president  frequently extols. The White House, however, chose not to do so in Beijing, either by making a similar address or by meeting with dissidents or others facing political persecution. In Seoul, South Korea,  on Wednesday, though, Mr. Bush said that the Olympics should not be used to criticize government constraints on worship and free speech and did not need to be because he had expressed his criticism to Chinese leaders throughout his presidency. “My message has been the same,” he said, when asked about the Olympics at an appearance with President Lee Myung-bak in a garden at the Blue House, the ancient compound in Seoul that is the office of South Korea’s president. “You should not fear religious people in your society as a matter of fact, religious people will make your society a better place that you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds.” He added, “And to the extent that people aren’t able to do that and people aren’t able to worship freely is, you know, I think is a mistake.” In none of Mr. Bush’s remarks has he directly addressed what advocates have called a pre-Olympic crackdown on dissent and potential protest. Nor has he mentioned Tibet, whose freedom movement and spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, have strong support in the United States and elsewhere. Even when critical, Mr. Bush has reflected a pragmatic view of China and has offered a far more lenient judgment of its internal affairs than those of other authoritarian governments, including Myanmar, Belarus, Iran and Zimbabwe. In his remarks on Thursday, for example, he bluntly called on Myanmar’s military leaders to release the opposition leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and all other political prisoners. He first visited China in 1975 when his father, the first President  Bush, was the chief American representative to the country after President Nixon’s opening to the Chinese. He recalled the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution, the swarming bicycles, the stultifying sameness of people’s clothes.  And yet, as he has in interviews and comments  leading up to the Games, he evoked a sense of both nostalgia and awe for the gains China has made since then. And he suggested that greater freedoms economically, politically and personally would speed the country’s progress. “We speak out for a free press, freedom of assembly, and labor rights not to antagonize China’s leaders, but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for China to develop its full potential,” he said. “And we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs, but to allow the Chinese people to express theirs.” The United States and China have complex relations, and Mr. Bush has sought from the start of his presidency in 2001 “to set our relationship on a sturdy, principled footing,” he said. He credited that strategy for allowing him to speak more forcefully on rights, even if most often in private. He  cited the mutual benefits of trade and diplomatic cooperation in security, as has been the case with talks to endNorth Korea’s nuclear program. He also noted an easing of tensions over Taiwan. “Ultimately, only China can decide what course it will follow,” he said. “America and our partners are realistic, and we are prepared for any possibility. I am optimistic about China’s future. Young people who grow up with the freedom to trade goods will ultimately demand the freedom to trade ideas, especially on an unrestricted Internet.”
