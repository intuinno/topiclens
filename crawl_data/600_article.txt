SEOUL, South Korea — In the first aggressive threat byNorth Koreasincea new leadership hierarchy was announced last month, the North vowed to attackSouth Koreaif the South resumed a propaganda war along their border, the North’s official Korean Central News Agency said Friday. With the youngest son of North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-il, now officially in line to succeed him, the North vowed to destroy propaganda sites in the South with “physical strikes,” according to a military official who was not named in the K.C.N.A. report. Those sites would most likely include radio transmitters placed along the border. “We do not want tension to intensify, nor will we ever condone any minor provocation or act of war that threatens peace,” the K.C.N.A. report said, ina translation by the Yonhap News Agencyin Seoul. The North Korean military official was also quoted as saying, “If the South does not stop anti-Pyongyang psychological broadcasts and the dissemination of leaflets, it will be met with our military’s strikes on those sites.” It was not clear if the report was suggesting that broadcasts had been restarted by the South, and a spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry could not be reached for comment early Saturday morning. On Oct. 5, just days after a meeting of the North Korean Workers’ Party, the South Korean defense minister, Kim Tae-young, said his military hadexpanded its system of loudspeakers along the borderand was prepared to send helium balloons into North Korea carrying AM radios and propaganda leaflets. He said a new propaganda war would be initiated if the South was provoked. The North has previously warned that its artillery will fire across the border to destroy the loudspeakers if the broadcasts resume. It also said it would shut down a jointly operated industrial complex in a North Korean town, Kaesong. The language in the latest K.C.N.A. report was relatively restrained. The agency often issues bellicose threats against South Korea and the United States, employing a vivid vocabulary that resembles the propaganda broadsides and baleful slogans used by the former Soviet Union. But a continuing leaflet campaign by South Korean civilian activists has deeply angered the North, which tries to control the information reaching it citizens. The North made an issue of the leaflets at recent bilateral military talks. The fliers ridicule Kim Jong-il and his government, and call upon North Koreans to defy the government.

North Korea’s military has threatened to retaliate againstSouth Koreaover its planned naval drills this week near the disputed sea border with the North. The North’s official Korean Central News Agency reported Tuesday that the military said it would crush the naval drills with a powerful physical blow, and warned all civilian ships to stay away from areas near the sea border. The South Korean drills are planned for Thursday through Monday. South Korea’s Defense Ministry officials were not immediately available for comment.

Bruce Cumings writes a revisionist history of the Korean War, which is misremembered, when it is remembered at all.

North Korea, like Cuba, is a country suspended in time, one that exists off modernity’s grid. It’s a place where the cold war never ended, where the heirloom paranoia is taken down and polished daily. Korea’s cold war chill is heating up. Four months ago a South Korean warship was sunk, and a South Korean-led international investigative team concluded that North Korea was responsible.  Next week  the United States and South Korea will begin large-scale naval exercises off the coasts of the Korean Peninsula and Japan ina show of force. The world will be watching, and here’s a book that American policymakers may hope it won’t be reading: Bruce Cumings’s “Korean War,” a powerful revisionist history of America’s intervention in Korea. Beneath its bland title, Mr. Cumings’s book is a squirm-inducing assault on America’s moral behavior during the Korean War, a conflict that he says  is misremembered when it is remembered at all. It’s a book that puts the reflexive anti-Americanism of North Korea’s leaders into sympathetic historical context. Mr. Cumings is chairman of the history department at the University of Chicago and the author of “The Origins of the Korean War,” a respected two-volume survey. He mows down a host of myths about the war in his short new book, which is a distillation of his own scholarship and that of many other historians. But he begins by mowing down David Halberstam. Mr. Cumings, who admires Mr. Halberstam’s writing about Vietnam,  plucks the wings from “The Coldest Winter,” Mr. Halberstam’s 2007 book about the Korean War. The book, he argues, makes all the classic mistakes popular American historians tend to make about this little understood war. Mr. Halberstam’s book is among those that “evince almost no knowledge of Korea or its history” and “barely get past two or three Korean names,” Mr. Cumings writes.  “Halberstam mentions the U.S. Military Government from 1945 to 1948, which deeply shaped postwar Korean history  —  in one sentence,” he adds. “There is absolutely nothing on the atrocious massacres of this war, or the American incendiary bombing campaigns.”  Ouch. Americans need to get past the idea, Mr. Cumings says, that the Korean War was a “discrete, encapsulated”  story that began in 1950, when the United States intervened to help push the Communist north out of the south of Korea, and ended in 1953, after the war bogged down  in a stalemate.  The United States succeeded in containment, establishing the 2.5-mile-wide demilitarized zone that still runs  through  Korea’s middle,  but failed miserably at the war for the north, an attempt at Communist rollback. Mr. Cumings argues that the Korean War was a civil war  with long, tangled historical roots, one in which America had little business meddling. He notes how “appallingly dirty” the war was. In terms of civilian slaughter, he declares, “our ostensibly democratic ally was the worst offender, contrary to the American image of the North Koreans as fiendish terrorists.” Mr. Cumings likens the indiscriminate American bombing of North Korea to genocide. He writes that American soldiers took part in,  or observed,  civilian atrocities not dissimilar to those at My Lai.  An official inquiry is needed into some of these events, he writes, for any kind of healing to begin.  (He also writes that this war, during which nearly 37,000 American soldiers died,  deserves a memorial as potent and serious as Maya Lin’s Vietnam memorial.) Among the most important things to understand about North Korean behavior then and now, Mr. Cumings writes, is the longtime enmity between Korea and Japan. Japan took Korea as a colony in 1910, with America’s blessing, and replaced the Korean language with Japanese. Japan humiliated and brutalized Korea in other ways.  (During World War II the Japanese Army forcibly turned tens of thousands of Korean women into sex slaves known as “comfort women.”) About this history Mr. Cumings writes, “Neither Korea nor Japan has ever gotten over it.” North Korea, which is virulently anti-Japan, remains bitter and fearful of that country and of the United States. It will do whatever it can to stay out of the hands of South Korea, where leaders have long-standing historical ties to Japan. Mr. Cumings, in “The Korean War,” details the north’s own atrocities,  and acknowledges that current “North Korean political practice is reprehensible.”  But he says that we view that country through “Orientalist bigotry,”  seeing only its morbid qualities.  We wrongly label the country Stalinist, he argues. “There is no evidence in the North Korean experience of the mass violence against whole classes of people or the wholesale ‘purge’ that so clearly characterized Stalinism,” he writes. The most eye-opening sections of “The Korean War” detail America’s saturation bombing of Korea’s north. “What hardly any Americans know or remember,” Mr. Cumings writes, “is that we carpet-bombed the north for three years with next to no concern for civilian casualties.”  The United States dropped more bombs in Korea (635,000 tons, as well as 32,557 tons of napalm) than in the entire Pacific theater during World War II.  Our logic seemed to be, he says, that “they are savages, so that gives us the right to shower napalm on innocents.” “The Korean War” has its share of awkward sentences, and Mr. Cumings makes at least one   mistake of his own, referring to Michael Herr’s 1977 nonfiction book “Dispatches,” about the Vietnam War, as a novel. But this lean book may put some readers in mind of“Wartime,”Paul Fussell’s acidic attack on some of the comforting myths about World War II. Mr. Cumings’s prose, at its best, is reminiscent of Mr. Fussell’s stylized, literate high dudgeon. Witness the carnage in this passage from early in “The Korean War”: “Here was the Vietnam War we came to know before Vietnam  —  gooks, napalm, rapes, whores, an unreliable ally, a cunning enemy, fundamentally untrained G.I.’s fighting a war their top generals barely understood, fragging of officers, contempt for the know-nothing civilians back home, devilish battles indescribable even to loved ones, press handouts from Gen. Douglas MacArthur’s headquarters apparently scripted by comedians or lunatics, an ostensible vision of bringing freedom and liberty to a sordid dictatorship run by servants of Japanese imperialism.” This year is the 60th anniversary of the Korean War’s conventional start.  Even from this distant vantage point, Mr. Cumings writes, there are still multiple unpleasant facts Americans have not learned about this war, “truths that most Americans do not know and perhaps don’t want to know, truths sometimes as shocking as they are unpalatable to American self-esteem.”  His book is a bitter pill, a sobering corrective.

The statement from the United Nations Security Council condemned the March torpedo attack, without singling out North Korea as responsible.

The North Korean envoy to theUnited Nations, Sin Son-ho, called a statement condemning the sinking of a South Korean warship, which the Security Council passed unanimously Friday, “our great diplomatic victory.” The statement condemned the March torpedo attack, which killed 48 sailors on  theCheonan, without singling outNorth Koreaas responsible, although it did note that a South Korean inquiry had found North Korea to blame.  Li Baodong, the ambassador from China, which helped block direct condemnation of North Korea, said the statement moved matters in “the right direction” because it urged “the parties concerned” to avoid escalating tensions.

Kim Jong-il may have sunk the Cheonan to deflect growing public disaffection.

Following weeks of careful investigation, South Korea has publicly accused North Korea of an overt and deliberate act of war. The evidence is compelling that the North torpedoed the Cheonan, a South Korean navy ship, killing 46 sailors. The South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, has promised to take “stern action,” but Seoul won’t risk a war it can’t win. Sanctions are possible, but they won’t impose hardships the North hasn’t seen before.  Still, things may be about to change. Pyongyang has done this sort of thing before. In the late 1960s, it attacked a South Korean warship, hijacked a South Korean plane, sent guerillas to storm the South’s presidential palace, and  captured a U.S. Navy intelligence ship, the Pueblo, holding 82 hostages for nearly a year. In the mid-1980s, North Korean operatives bombed a hotel in Burma to try to assassinate South Korea’s president, and blew up a commercial airliner, killing 115 people. In 1996, a North Korean submarine crew landed on southern shores. But there has not been such a high-profile incident since. Why now? Rumors are flying that Kim Jong-il is dying, and that he ordered the attack to bolster support for his son Kim Jong-un among hawks in the country’s military leadership. That’s pure speculation, not based on much. Kim has held a series of private meetings with foreign guests in the past few months, and their reports offer no hard evidence of the Dear Leader’s imminent demise. He was also healthy enough to meet with Chinese officials in Beijing earlier this month, spending many hours travelling to and from by train. In any case, the military has every incentive to hold things together even if  the designated heir isn’t really in charge. But there is a much more serious threat now generating turmoil within North Korea. In 2002, the regime began tinkering with small-scale experiments in capitalism. The plan was to minimize the risk of civil unrest by providing citizens with access to imported food and consumer products that their government can’t provide. The flow of unregulated cellphones, radios and videotapes of South Korean soap operas from China created a shadow merchant class and new opportunities for official corruption. Early last year, the North Korean government moved to rein in the burgeoning black market. On Nov. 30, it abruptly ordered a currency reform to roll back private markets, target official corruption, control market activity and tackle rising inflation. The goal was to kill the capitalist Frankenstein before it grew beyond the regime’s control. The consequences were dramatic.  North Korean citizens were given one week to exchange foreign currency for North Korean coin, with a limit of the black market equivalent of about $40. The announcement triggered panic as citizens dumped currency and hoarded goods. Inflation spiked. The accumulated wealth and savings of what passes for a middle class in North Korea — merchants, local officials, military officers — evaporated. South Koreans with connections inside North Korea reported black market hyperinflation, severe food shortages and pockets of serious civil unrest. The government quickly suppressed the protests and tried to appease public anger with emergency supplies of rice in the hardest-hit areas. Then something extraordinary happened: The North Korean government backed down. It reopened private markets and again allowed transactions in foreign currencies. The  prime minister issued a stunning and nearly unprecedented public apology. State planners were publicly humiliated. A few weeks ago, North Korea’s finance minister was executed by firing squad. In other words, succession is only one of the problems facing the North Korean elite. The larger fear is that the state can’t isolate North Korea’s people forever, that only access to products from outside the country can ease chronic shortages, and that all this new market activity is raising public expectations the North Korean leadership can’t meet. In April, the regime reportedly provided senior military officials with foreign cars to ensure their loyalty. That sounds a lot like the late East German leader Erich Honecker’s bid to reward his generals with weekend shopping trips to the West — a move that only whetted their appetite for more and hastened the country’s demise. Did North Korean torpedo the Cheonan to manufacture a military crisis that might rally angry North Koreans to their government? Maybe. Would the attack create unity within the military ranks that might help smooth the succession process when Kim Jong-il finally dies? Perhaps. China and South Korea are right to worry that a North Korean collapse would flood both countries with sick and starving refugees. But beyond the speculation, it’s starting to look like North Korea’s insecurity might be approaching a tipping point — raising the risk of another hostile act that might send North and South Koreans forces stumbling toward a shooting war that can only end in disaster for both.

President Obama should use the Cheonan incident as an opportunity to shift its approach to North Korea.

IN 1998, I led a team of American government experts to an underground installation to determine if North Korea was cheating ona 1994 agreement to eliminate its nuclear weapons program.Pyongyang had recently tested a long-range missile, and relations were tense. For a week, we passed barking guard dogs and shouting soldiers doing their synchronized morning exercises to wander through a maze of tunnels. Once, when a team member violated the rules for the inspection (by sketching some of the buildings) we were locked in a room surrounded by troops with bayonets drawn while I argued for hours with the base commander. When we were finally allowed to leave, a van equipped with loudspeakers blasted anti-American slogans at our bus. Nevertheless, we were able to complete our investigation, which found no nuclear activities, because Pyongyang had a stake in maintaining a relationship with us: the North Koreans were expecting William Perry, the former defense secretary and the first presidential envoy to visit their country. Mr. Perry would pave the way for President Bill Clinton to meet a top-ranking North Korean official in Washington. In the 16 years I have worked with North Korea, I have made 18 trips there, and I remain convinced that sustained diplomatic engagement is the only way to encourage the North to moderate its threatening behavior. The alternative is far worse: an isolated North Korea that is heading down a path of defiance. This lesson has been forgotten. When President Obama took office he pledged to engage rogue states in dialogue, but he didn’t follow through with North Korea. Confronted by its provocative nuclear and missile tests, he secured international sanctions, stepped up cooperation with South Korea and Japan and even garnered some support from China, the North’s closest friend. All that made sense as far as it went. But then American officials neglected to re-engage Pyongyang. Instead of using last summer’sextraordinary meeting between former President Clinton and Kim Jong-ilto jump-start dialogue, they lashed themselves to a set of hard and fast preconditions for talks, demanding that Pyongyang pledge to give up its nuclear arsenal and return to multilateral nuclear negotiations. Last December, Ambassador Stephen Bosworthwas sent to North Korea to keep communications open, but his visit was wasted as Washington spent months debating about whether to hold another meeting. As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton travels to Asia next week, amid reports that a South Korean investigation has found the North responsible for sinking the South’s warship Cheonan, the administration persists in playing a waiting game — Mrs. Clinton calls it“strategic patience”— based on the assumption that time is on our side. The more Pyongyang is plagued by political instability, food shortages and a declining economy, the theory goes, the more likely it will be to yield to American demands. Yet Kim Jong-il remains in control. Food shortages exist, but harvests from the past two years have been relatively good. Industrial production grew last year and, thanks to ties with China, trade declined only slightly. And the North believes its nuclear security blanket makes it less vulnerable to American threats. Officials in Pyongyang who have hard-line tendencies welcome American strategic patience. It enables North Korea to keep its nuclear weapons, build new ones and export dangerous technologies. (The Internet makes exporting a bomb design as easy as pressing the send button.) The Cheonan sinking makes clear the dangers of playing a waiting game. The sinking — probably the North’s effort to retaliate for past clashes and to humiliate the conservative South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak — shows how unwise it is to leave stability on the peninsula hostage to Pyongyang’s goodwill. What should the Obama administration do instead? Since Mr. Kim has said publicly thathe is open to talks,the United States should do nothing to shut what may be a window of opportunity.  Now that North Korea has been found responsible for the Cheonan sinking, Seoul will demand — and the United States should support — punishing Pyongyang. But the Cheonan sinking also provides an opportunity for the Obama administration to shift its approach to North Korea. Now, we should avoid steps that might lead to a major escalation of tensions. One reasonable response would be to seek condemnation by the United Nations Security Council, while expanding  military defenses against the North and strengthening cooperation with Japan. And instead of demanding new preconditions for talks — an apology for the Cheonan, for example — we should mount a gradual pragmatic effort to engage in new discussions, not as a reward for bad behavior or to talk for the sake of talking, but to make us more secure. We should not delude ourselves into thinking that Kim Jong-il will soon give up his nuclear arsenal, even for financial rewards; it is too important to his vision of a strong North Korea. But Mr. Kim’s vision is not set in concrete. While growing political and economic ties with China have benefited the North, he is probably uncomfortable with his country’s increasing dependence on Beijing. Concerned about inter-Korean tensions and about a nuclear-armed North, China would also be supportive. So a serious initiative to build better relations could eventually make headway. And it is very possible that, as relations improve, the North Koreans may be persuaded to accept a step-by-step process of increasingly tight, verifiable controls on their nuclear program, and on their dangerous exports. While this process would not eliminate all of North Korea’s nuclear weapons right away, as trust is restored, the North may reach a point where it no longer sees them as vital to its national security. But our immediate focus should be on the journey toward denuclearization, not on the final destination. Negotiations with North Korea can be frustrating, but dialogue can work. It worked in 1994, when intelligence suggested that an unconstrained North could have bomb-making material for almost 100 nuclear weapons by 2000. The agreement reached months later prevented that. By the time that accord collapsed, in 2002, the North had enough material for only six weapons. Even limited success is better than none at all. In the aftermath of the Cheonan sinking, the United States and South Korea must recognize that a return to dialogue would serve our interests. It is the only realistic way to rein in North Korea’s objectionable activities.

South Korea salvaged the remaining half of a warship that sank near a sea border with North Korea, as suspicion of a North Korean torpedo attack deepened.

SEOUL, South Korea —South Koreaon Saturday salvaged the remaining half of a warship that sank near a disputed sea border withNorth Korea, as suspicion of a North Korean torpedo attack deepened and two former South Korean presidents urged the country’s leaders to punish Pyongyang economically. The ship, the Cheonan,sankafter a mysterious explosion split it in half on March 26. One sailor was found dead in the ship’s wreckage Saturday, bringing the total of confirmed dead to 40. Six others are missing and presumed dead. The rear half of the ship was lifted out of the water last week. A team of international investigators have been scrutinizing the wreck to find clues to what and who caused the blast, which they believe was external. North Korea has denied any involvement. In an indication of how seriously South Korea views the incident, President Lee Myung-bak met Friday with former presidents — a common practice when the nation is facing a crisis and seeking to build a national consensus. Only two of South Korea’s three living former presidents were well enough to attend: Chun Doo-hwan, a former military dictator, and Kim Young-sam, who opposed the dictatorship but became a political conservative. The government briefed the local news media on the meeting late Friday, saying the former presidents had both said they believed the ship was attacked by North Korea, a claim Mr. Lee has been careful not to make while the incident is still being investigated. At the briefing, the former leaders’ personal, scarring experiences with the North were detailed. According to the local media, Mr. Kim noted that his mother was  killed in 1960 by a North Korean agent who attacked his island village on the south coast. Mr. Chun, meanwhile, spoke of a spectacular bomb attack on South Korea’s leaders in 1983 that killed several cabinet ministers during a presidential visit to Yangon, Myanmar. Such recriminations were rare during the decade from 1998 to 2008, when liberals ruled Korea and pursued a “Sunshine Policy” of aid and joint ventures meant to eventually reunite North and South Korea. Mr. Lee came to power in 2008 promising to take a tougher line with the North, which had continued with a nuclear arms program despite the many overtures from the South. The meeting Friday — with its tough sound bites on the North — can be expected to continue to shore up Mr. Lee’s standing with conservative voters. On Friday, the two former presidents suggested dismantling some of the results of the Sunshine Policy, shutting down a joint industrial park in the North and denying permission to some North Korean ships to ply South Korean waters to save time and fuel as they travel abroad.

President Lee Myung-bak never mentioned North Korea by name, following the cautious stance of avoiding blame until an inquiry is completed.

SEOUL, South Korea — Pausing to wipe away tears with a handkerchief,South Korea’s president,Lee Myung-bak, vowed Monday to respond “resolutely and unwaveringly” tolast month’s deadly sinkingof a South Korean warship in disputed waters nearNorth Korea. But South Korean political experts and politicians said there was little their country could actually do if investigators find the North was responsible for the March 26 explosion, which left 46 sailors dead or missing. South Korean salvage cranes are still trying to raise the front half of the 1,200-ton Cheonan, which was torn in two by the blast during a routine patrol. “I promise you that as president, I will uncover the cause of the Cheonan’s sinking down to the very last detail,” Mr. Lee, who came to office promising a tougher line against the North, said in a 10-minute televised speech. During the broadcast, Mr. Lee grew tearful as he read the names of the dead and missing. However, he never mentioned North Korea by name, following the cautious stance of his government in avoiding placing blame on the North until an inquiry of the mysterious blast was completed. On Saturday, state-run media in North Koreabroke three weeks of silenceabout the sinking to deny that their country was involved. However, with investigators already concluding that theexplosion came from outsidethe Cheonan’s hull, the consensus view in Seoul is that the ship was attacked by either a mine or a torpedo from a North Korean submarine. The ship went down in Yellow Sea waters where the two Koreas have had bloody naval clashes three times since 1999. The question now preoccupying South Korean media and North Korea watchers is what their country can do in response if it turns out the North was behind the attack. The answer seems to be precious little, say political experts and politicians. They say economic sanctions will have limited effect on the already isolated North, and the South will likely balk at an outright military confrontation. “If evidence makes it clear that North Korea was involved, we would fall into an extremely difficult dilemma, both militarily and non-militarily,” Kim Jong-soo, a former defense minister, told reporters. Even a minor rise in tensions would most likely spook investors and consumers, undermining the $800 billion South Korean economy. Still, Mr. Lee is already facing pressure from within his own conservative Grand National Party to retaliate. Over the weekend, the foreign minister, Yu Myung-hwan, said South Korea might ask the United Nations Security Council for new sanctions against the North. There has also been talk of shutting down a South Korean-run industrial complex near the North Korean city of Kaesong, which has been a source of hard currency for the North. With few options for punishing the North, political experts say Mr. Lee may end up stalling for time. Investigators from the United States, Sweden and other nations are examining the rear half of the Cheonan, which was recovered  last week. While the front half is expected to be raised by the end of this week, a final decision on the North’s involvement may take weeks, or even months, political experts said. “Revenge will inevitably lead to bad results,” said Andrei Lankov, a professor at Kookmin University in Seoul. “Lee Myung-bak is trying to buy time, to let things cool down.” For now, the South Korean public seems to be showing more sorrow than anger over the suspected attack. South Koreans said they were shocked by the loss of life, but did not want war. “We need to be patient and continue engaging North Korea,” said Hong Jin-ki, 42, a computer programmer in Seoul. “If we take measures, then both South Korea and North Korea will suffer.”

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreaon Saturday denied involvement in themysterious sinkingof a South Korean warship in waters disputed between the two Koreas. The denial came a day afterSouth Koreablamedan “external explosion”for the sinking, fueling speculation that the ship might have been hit by a North Korean torpedo or mine. In its first official reaction tothe March 26 sinking, North Korea also accused South Korea of “fabricating” the cause. “They are using the media to attribute it to us,” the North’s state-run news agency, K.C.N.A., quoted a military official as saying. “This is all a plot against” North Korea, he added. The explosion split the ship’s hull into two pieces, killing 38 sailors andleaving 8 others missing. Although South Korean officials have not directly blamed North Korea, saying only that they were investigating the possibility of its involvement, South Korean news media and analysts have already begun speculating on how Seoul could retaliate. The sinkingcame at a delicate timefor President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea, as well as for American-led international efforts to bring North Korea back to six-nation nuclear disarmament talks. Before the sinking, Mr. Lee had reportedly been seeking a summit meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il. If signs of North Korean involvement emerge, a weak reaction on Mr. Lee’s part could undermine his credentials among his conservative base ahead of mayoral and gubernatorial elections scheduled for June. Mr. Lee has repeatedly vowed a “stern” action once it becomes clear who was to blame. But few South Koreans expect their government to risk war with North Korea. The South is scheduled to host to the Group of 20 summit meeting of leaders of major economic powers in November. South Koreans also fear that an escalating military tension will hurt their economy. Still, if investigators conclude that North Korea sank the ship, Mr. Lee will come under fire for the hole in the country’s defense, analysts say. Some experts speculate that the ship may have sunk not in a premeditated attack but by hitting a mine left over from the cold war.

For more than 40 years, Choi Sung-yong has devoted himself to trying to find missing South Koreans, including his father, believed to have been snatched by the North.
==::==

==::==
SEOUL, South Korea CHOI SUNG-YONG remembers his father as a war hero who became a successful fishing boat captain, a reserved man who helped at orphanages and once splurged to buy his music-loving teenage son a record player, a true luxury at the time. But all the memories are tinged with loss. In 1967, when Mr. Choi was just 15, his father’s boat failed to return from sea. The family went into mourning, assuming the boat had sunk. But three months later they were shocked to learn that Mr. Choi’s father, Choi Won-mo, was alive, but lost to them. His vessel, it turned out, had been captured byNorth Korea, and when the North Koreans released the crew, they kept Mr. Choi’s father. In the more than four decades since, Mr. Choi, 57, has devoted himself to trying to find his father and the hundreds of other missing South Koreans believed to have been snatched by North Korean agents. He toils in a tiny office here, where the walls are covered with sepia-toned photos of the missing. “So far,” he said, “my work has been a lonely fight.” Unlike in Japan — where the plight of fewer than 20 Japanese abductees has become something of a national obsession — the issue of the disappeared is a divisive one here, freighted with a tangle of conflicting emotions about the North and the collective suffering of South Koreans since the peninsula’s fratricidal war from 1950 to 1953. In the early years,South Korea’s fervently anti-Communist military rulers treated families like Mr. Choi’s with suspicion, fearful that those who had disappeared were defectors lured by the same ideology that helped cleave the country. But even a shift away from authoritarianism did not help. A succession of liberal presidents who gained power in democratic elections starting in the 1990s ignored the families’ cause in pursuit of reconciliation with the North. While South Korea’s current, conservative, president, Lee Myung-bak, has taken a tougher line on the abduction issue, the South Korean public remains farless passionate on the subject than the Japanese, who helped drive their leaders not only to sever economic ties with the North, but also to continually urge the United States not to forget the abductees in its drive to get the North to give up itsnuclear weaponsprogram. Fed up with waiting, Mr. Choi decided years ago to take matters into his own hands. In the late 1990s, he began traveling to northern China, where he developed contacts among North Koreans to try to gather information about his father. Over time, he built something of an underground railroad in the North by using Koreans, sometimes by paying, to help the abductees escape across the border. And slowly, he began to achieve, in a small way, what the Seoul government has so far failed to do. SINCE 2000, Mr. Choi says, Abductees’ Family Union, which he leads, has smuggled seven South Koreans back to their country via China, including one who later returned to the North because he had started a family there. Officials at South Korea’s Ministry of Unification, which helps oversee inter-Korean relations, acknowledge that Mr. Choi has succeeded in bringing out abducted South Koreans, though they will not confirm the number. His efforts — and his role with Abductees’ Family Union, which lobbies for the families of 505 civilians thought by the South Korean government to have been kidnapped — have earned him wide attention in the South’s media. They have also, he says, led to death threats from the North. As a result, he is now afraid to travel to China. But he says he will press on until he finds out what happened to his father, who would be 99 years old now if still alive, or at least retrieve his remains. His father’s former crew said his father had been kept in the North because of his war record, and Mr. Choi fears he may have been executed. “I have been a headache for the South Korean government,” Mr. Choi said. “But I am finally carrying out my filial duty to my father.” Like his father, most of the missing are fishermen who vanished when they ventured out to sea in the 1960s and 1970s. Based on South Korean intelligence and the tales of defectors, it appears that the North had several goals in mind when it captured South Koreans. Some were put to work as laborers. Others — like at least some of the Japanese — helped train spies who had little chance to learn about other nations, given their reclusive leaders’ absolute control on news and penchant for propaganda. The abductees, experts on the issue in the South say, were also tools for the North’s propaganda machine; North Korea still insists that South Koreans who left their country defected for a happier life. One of those who Mr. Choi’s group smuggled out of North Korea isChoi Wook-il, who is no relation to him. A shrimp fisherman, Choi Wook-il said his boat was seized by a North Korean gunboat in 1975. He was kept in the North until three years ago, when he was led at night across a frozen river into China and freedom, he said. Now 69, he lives with his wife in a government-provided apartment in the city of Ansan, south of Seoul. He said that without the efforts of Choi Sung-yong, he would never have been able to return to his life. “He is the only one making efforts.” The fisherman’s wife, Yang Jeong-ja, 67, said she thought he was dead until Choi Sung-yong one day showed her a letter her husband had written to his brother, which was smuggled out via China. He also presented a picture of her husband taken in North Korea and said he could get her husband out. Ms. Yang was skeptical, but agreed to his plan. Her husband said that one night almost a decade ago, he got a knock on the door from a North Korean who said he had been sent by Ms. Yang to lead him to China. At first, Mr. Choi — who had been working on a pear and corn farm because his middle-school education was deemed inadequate for spy training — said he did not believe his visitor. It took nine visits until he finally agreed to leave. After they arrived in South Korea, his guide defected. The other Mr. Choi said such successes help make up for the continued pushback from many South Koreans. He has been criticized by government officials and many people in the public for threatening the South’s engagement with the North, which most South Koreans support in some form. That stance is somewhat pragmatic; those who want to unite with the North say peace will not only allow any abductees who are alive to return home, but also reunite the thousands of families split up during the war. Experts say it is also difficult for the families of those who were kidnapped to gain sympathy because many of their countrymen feel some bitterness about their singling out their own suffering when so many families have been separated. “This issue has been intertwined with all the national pain,” said Lee Keum-soon, a researcher on the abductions at the Korea Institute for National Unification, a government-financed research center. FAMILIES of abductees say they are more hopeful now. President Lee, who took office two years ago, in November  called addressing the abduction issue a precondition for holding any future summit meeting with the North. Mr. Choi has also been appointed to a group that advises the government as it continues to investigate missing persons cases to determine if more of them are possible abductees. On his wall, he proudly displays a plaque that he received in 2009 from the president proclaiming his father a patriot for having piloted a boat that clandestinely dropped off guerrilla fighters behind enemy lines during the Korean War. “Whenever I ask a North Korean for news of my father, my heart still beats wildly,” Mr. Choi said. “I have struggled to accept that I am a child whose father will never return.”

South Korea delivered medicine to North Korea to combat swine flu a day after the North threatened retaliation over what it claimed were naval drills around the countries’ disputed sea border.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A convoy of South Korean trucks crossed the border intoNorth Koreaon Friday morning to deliver medicine to combatswine flu, a day after the North threatened retaliation over what it claimed were naval drills around the countries’ disputed sea border. The North Koreans accused the South of staging the exercises to escalate tensions. The previously scheduled shipment of medicine represented the South Korean government’s first humanitarian aid since President Lee Myung-bak, a conservative, took office in 2008 with a pledge to pursue a hard-line policy toward the North and to hold it to its pledges on nuclear disarmament. North Korea acknowledged for the first time last week thatswine flu had broken outin the country after Seoul offered unconditional aid to help contain the spread of the virus. North Korean officials did not mention any virus-related deaths, but a civic group in Seoul said the disease had killed about 50 people in the North since early November. South Koreasent enough doses of the antiviral drugsTamifluand Relenza for 500,000 North Koreans, according to Seoul’s Unification Ministry. On Thursday, the North’s official Korean Central News Agency, citing an unidentified source, reported that the South Korean military had staged exercises with underwater explosives near the border. The area was the scene of a naval clash last month that left one North Korean sailor dead and three others wounded. “We cannot but view this as a premeditated provocation aimed at raising tension in the militarily sensitive waters,” the news agency said of the military exercises. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff dismissed the North’s claim, saying Friday that the drills were routine and that they took place in the South’s waters. The North does not recognize the sea boundary, drawn by the United Nations at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, and has claimed that it should be redrawn farther south.

North Korea said it had been forced to act “urgently” after water levels at the dam reached a dangerously high level.

SEOUL,South Korea—  Answering South Korean demands for an explanation of a dam release that created a flash flood in which  at least three South Koreans died,North Koreasaid Monday that it had been forced to act “urgently” after water levels at the dam reached a dangerously high level. The account  did little to defuse tension, with the South Korean Unification Ministry saying in a statement that the explanation “does not satisfy us” and faulting the North for failing to mention the casualties. On Sunday morning, without warning, North Korea unleashed columns of water from its Hwanggang Dam, 26 miles north of the border with the South. The flash flood swept away six South Koreans who were camping or fishing farther downstream. Three bodies were found on Monday. Earlier on Monday, South Korea had sent the North a telegram demanding an explanation. In an unusually rapid response, the North said it had to release the water quickly between late Saturday and early Sunday because the water level in the dam had reached a dangerously high level, the ministry said. North Korea also promised to warn the South of similar releases in the future. South Korean officials said they found the North Korean explanation unsatisfactory because there had been no heavy rain in the North in recent days. South Korea has long feared a “water offensive” from the North. In recent years, North Korea has been building dams on rivers that flow into South Korea, raising the possibility that a sudden release of water, by accident or design, could cause damage in the South. “We haven’t found any evidence yet that North Korea released its Hwanggang Dam as a water attack,” said Won Tae-je, a spokesman for the Defense Ministry. Still, the episode compels South Korea to “seriously consider” civil defense drills against a possible water attack, he said. The South Korean military and government came under fire on Monday for failing to notice the sudden rise in the water level of the Imjin River and warn people downstream. South Korean television images showed a military tank mired in a flooded field. The Imjin basin is one of the most militarized zones in the South. The river’s water level on the border jumped from 7.5 feet to 15.1 feet on Sunday morning. The Hwanggang Dam, with an estimated capacity of 400 million tons of water, was completed in 2007. Short of fuel, North Korea says it makes dams for electricity. Still, South Korea is building a dam downstream as a bulwark against a possible deluge released from the North.

Hillary Rodham Clinton offers a new take on the job of secretary of state, from weighty themes to lighter ones.
==::==
2009-02-21T00:00:00Z
==::==
BEIJING — On Friday morning,Hillary Rodham Clintonwas the picture of a stern superpower diplomat, warningNorth Koreanot to test a long-range ballistic missile. A few hours later, she was asked by a giggly Korean student how she knew she had fallen in love with her husband. “I feel more like an advice columnist than a secretary of state,” Mrs. Clinton said with a smile. Henry Kissinger, this isn’t. On each stop of her Asian tour, Mrs. Clinton is redefining the job of secretary of state, fusing the weighty themes of regional security and nuclear proliferation with lighter encounters in which Mrs. Clinton is quizzed about her musical tastes or asked what it was like to raise her daughter. She is also redefining herself to some extent. After going to Beijing in 1995 as first lady to deliver an impassioned speech on women’s rights, Mrs. Clinton has sidelined human rights on this trip, saying she does not want the topic to interfere with central issues likeclimate changeor the economic crisis. In Indonesia on Thursday, Mrs. Clinton appeared on a popular variety show, “Awesome,” on which she told the young host, somewhat sheepishly, that her favorite musicians were the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. She politely declined to sing, saying it would empty the room. None of this is especially new to Americans. But it is novel to people outside the United States, who expect foreign ministers  to stick to a diplomatic script. As she neared the end of her maiden voyage as secretary of state with a two-day visit to Beijing, Mrs. Clinton said she was determined to make a connection to people “in a way that is not traditional, not confined by the ministerial greeting and the staged handshake photo.” “I see our job right now, given where we are in the world and what we’ve inherited, as repairing relations, not only with governments but with people,” she said to reporters on Friday. To do that, Mrs. Clinton is exploiting both her megawatt celebrity and her training during the presidential campaign. On Friday, nearly 3,000 female students packed an auditorium atEwha Womans Universityin Seoul to hear Mrs. Clinton deliver a speech that ranged from North Korea’s nuclear threat to the challenge women face in balancing work and family. A standing-room-only crowd atthe University of Tokyolistened to Mrs. Clinton discuss how the United States should rebuild its ties to the Muslim world. Toward the end, a nervous young woman, who said she played on a baseball team, asked Mrs. Clinton how to become as strong as she was. “Well, I played a lot of baseball, and I played with a lot of boys,” she replied, to peals of laughter. Mrs. Clinton said she was skeptical that these appearances alone would lead to changes in the policies of foreign governments. But by connecting with people on a personal level, she said, she believes she can help mold public opinion, which, in turn, can influence governments. “President Obama has an extraordinary capacity to do that because of the really positive feelings that he personally engenders,” she said. “To a lesser degree, I have some of the same capacity.” In a working-class area of Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital, a small crowd trailed Mrs. Clinton as she toured health and water-treatment projects financed by the United States Agency for International Development. “People are very excited to see Hillary Clinton,” said Daniel Sitorus, 24, a lawyer in the neighborhood. “It doesn’t matter that she isn’t Barack Obama; she is one of the most famous women in the world.” She is not just beguiling audiences. During her visit to Seoul, Mrs. Clinton raised eyebrows among journalists and analysts with a frank assessment of how a succession struggle in North Korea could undermine talks over its nuclear program. She said she was baffled by the reaction. “I don’t think that it’s a forbidden subject to talk about succession in the hermit kingdom,” she said. “Maybe this is unusual because you are supposed to be so careful that we spend hours avoiding stating the obvious,” Mrs. Clinton continued. “I think it’s worth, perhaps, being more straightforward, trying to engage other countries on the basis of the reality that exists.” That said, Mrs. Clinton did reaffirm Friday that the United States would conduct negotiations with the government ofKim Jong-il“now, and for as long as he is the man calling the shots.” And in a news conference withSouth Korea’s foreign minister, Yu Myung-hwan, she used time-tested diplomatic language in warning North Korea to stop its belligerence toward South Korea. “North Korea,” she said, “is not going to get a different relationship with the United States while insulting and refusing dialogue with the Republic of Korea.” Mrs. Clinton, however, evinces little patience for running through talking points. In Beijing, for example, she said she would raise familiar issues with Chinese officials like human rights in Tibet, while she expected them to complain about American arms sales to Taiwan. “We know what they’re going to say, because I’ve had those conversations for more than a decade with Chinese leaders,” said Mrs. Clinton, who first visited Beijing in 1995 for her speech on women’s rights and has written about how she made her Chinese hosts uncomfortable. This time, however, she said human rights concerns should not derail discussions on big issues like the global economic crisis, climate change and North Korea. That has earned her sharp criticism from Amnesty International, which said Friday that it was “shocked and extremely disappointed” that  human rights were not made more of a priority. For all of her innovations, Mrs. Clinton’s schedule in Beijing on Saturday looks like that of any other secretary of state: meetings with President Hu Jintao, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao and other senior officials. On Sunday, before she flies home, she plans to attend church services, a small gesture to religious freedom in a Communist society. But she said she did not want to make a big deal of it. “I’m going to be there on Sunday morning, and I thought I would go to church,” she said.

North Korea broke from its restraint this week during military exercises held by the South, saying it was prepared to use its nuclear weapons if it is attacked.

HONG KONG —North Korea, breaking from the restraint it showed this week during military exercises by the South, said Thursday that it was prepared to use itsnuclear weaponsif it was attacked. The North is “fully prepared to launch a sacred war,” the minister of the People’s Armed Forces, Kim Young-chun, said in comments carried by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency and quoted by Western news media. North Korea’s comments are typically bellicose, but they had been low key this week asSouth Koreaheld military exercises across its territory. On Monday, the South staged live-fire artillery drills on Yeonpyeong Island, which was shelled by the North’s artillery on Nov. 23. Four South Koreans were killed. North Korea claims the waters around Yeonpyeong and disputes the maritime border known as the Northern Limit Line. After the drills on Monday, the North’s official news agency said it was“not worth reacting”to the exercise. South Korea followed those drills with three days of naval exercises, and on Thursday, the South heldlarge-scale military exercisesbetween its capital, Seoul, and the border with the North. President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea vowed Thursday to conduct a quick counterattack if South Korean territory was attacked again. “I thought patience would bring peace to this land,” Mr. Lee said during a visit to an army unit in Kangwon Province, the Yonhap news service reported.

Kim Shin-jo, once part of a failed North Korean assassination plot in Seoul, fears his adopted country fails to appreciate the threat posed by his old one.
==::==

==::==
SEOUL, South Korea HIS fatal mistake, the North Korean commando soon came to realize, was not killing the South Korean villagers when he had the chance. The orders were clear, if he and his fellow assassins  came upon any civilians: kill them immediately, bury them and get on with the mission to slip into Seoul and kill the president. But this was late January, the high-mountain ground was frozen, and Kim Shin-jo, a 27-year-old special forces lieutenant, did not want to go to the effort of digging graves. Instead he warned the villagers,  encountered one night during the journey from the North, not to go to the authorities, after which he and his men continued on toward the Blue House, the presidential residence. But the villagers ignored the warning and went straight to the police, who then alerted the military. “That was when it all began to unravel,” Mr. Kim said. Dressed as South Korean soldiers, the 31 Communist commandos dodged their pursuers for three days, talked their way through various checkpoints and got to within a few hundred yards of the Blue House, where they were finally confronted. It was late morning, Jan. 21, 1968. A ferocious gun battle broke out, and dozens of South Korean troops and civilians were killed. A school bus reportedly was caught in the cross-fire, and three American soldiers also were killed. As the North Korean raiding party scattered and retreated northward, hunted for more than a week, all but two of the attackers committed suicide or were killed. One survivor was a commando who got back safely to the North and later became a general. The other was Mr. Kim. AFTER a year of interrogation, he was surprised to receive a pardon, apparently because he was found not to have fired his gun. He had assumed he would be executed. After that he was reborn, first as a South Korean citizen and then as a Presbyterian minister. He met his wife a year after his release — she is the one who turned him to Christianity — and they now have two grown children. Mr. Kim said his church outside Seoul had 70,000 members, making it the largest Presbyterian congregation in the world. He is one of 80 pastors there. The South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, recently appointed Mr. Kim, 69, to be a human rights adviser to the governing Grand National Party. Oddly, one of the leaders of the party, and its presumptive candidate for president in 2012, is Park Geun-hye, the daughter of the late president Park Chung-hee — the very man that Mr. Kim was sent to kill in 1968. (Mr. Park was assassinated by his own spy chief, in 1979.) Mr. Kim and Mrs. Park met for the first time only two months ago, at the funeral of a high-ranking North Korean defector. Mr. Kim had never sent her an apology for trying to kill her father, nor did he think to apologize at the funeral, he said, “because she was so immediately glad to see me.” “She took my hand and was so warm to me,” he said. “I think she sees me as part of the team. She likes me.” In the wake of the North Korean artillery attack last month  on Yeonpyeong Island inSouth Korea, which killed two marines and two civilians, Mr. Kim has openly called for a new military readiness in South Korea, along with a harder line and a deeper suspicion toward his former homeland. “A whole village was bombed to the point of no return, and aside from a few who want to retaliate, the rest of the country is not ready, discipline-wise,” he said. “South Korea is aboveNorth Koreain everything except discipline. If there’s a war, and it comes down to psychology, they would still win.” He favors a total cutoff of aid to the North, including humanitarian food deliveries by the United Nations, as well as long stints of obligatory military service for young South Koreans. A decade of conciliation toward the North, he said, has made the South too complacent. “People here are numb to the seriousness, especially people under 50,”  Mr. Kim said, getting visibly agitated, and not just from a large mug of late-afternoon coffee with two sugars. “We need to be like the Israelis, where the whole population is on the same page.” There has been deep public outrage here because civilians were killed on Yeonpyeong, and it was widely suggested that these were the first civilian casualties in the decades of North-South clashes. Many people, either forgetting their own history or being unaware of it, insisted that the North had “upped the ante” by attacking civilians for the first time. Park Tae-gyun, a history professor at Seoul National University, said the Yeonpyeong attack bore some resemblance to the Blue House raid in that each was part of a cluster of provocative North Korean actions. Even if the Blue House mission, in retrospect, seems so brazen as to be suicidal, Mr. Kim said he fully expected his team to succeed. He was told that the founding president of North Korea, Kim Il-sung, wanted Park Chung-hee assassinated, and that was enough for him. Orders were orders. “I was told, ‘Gun him down. Use the gun.’ That’s as specific as it got,” Mr. Kim said. EVEN now, details of the long-ago mission remain fresh in his memory. Mr. Kim recalls certain smells as he and his comrades slipped through minefields along the border and into the mountains above Seoul. He remembers being surprised at seeing so many cars in the  capital, how big the houses were in comparison to back home and how the lights of the city twinkled so brightly in the night. “We had been taught that South Korea was living in the dark ages,” he said. “But when we looked through our binoculars and saw all the cars, we began to sense a discrepancy.” He can still demonstrate the tongue-severing technique for a blood-letting suicide that all special forces troopers were taught in the North. He also remembers his fearful retreat from Seoul after the mission fell apart — burying his TT-33 pistol, which he said he never fired, along with his knife and the 14 hand grenades that each commando had been issued. And he certainly remembers surrendering, with his hands above his head, after being surrounded: “I was single, a young man. I wanted to save myself.” Part of the mountain path that some of the North Korean raiders used in their retreat from Seoul has been turned into a trail for hikers, tourists and nature lovers. Even though Mr. Kim never actually used that path, it has been officially christened the “Kim Shin-jo Route.” “When I think about that I get in a bad mood,” he said. “Even if they named it after me with good intentions, it doesn’t carry a good meaning. It was not a good incident.” Mr. Kim acknowledged feeling “psychologically damaged” by his past. “Because I was the only survivor I got all the blame,” he said. “I suffered all the sins, if you will, of all 31 men.” For several years after the raid he was called “the mountain pirate,” a nickname that still rankles. And he worries that his notoriety has put undue strain and pressure on his family. He even tried changing his name, to Kim Jae-hyun. “Sometimes I think about emigrating to the United States,” he said. “But then I calm down and remember that this is the society that gave me freedom.”

Hwang Jang-yop, 87, who defected to South Korea in 1997, was the North’s former chief ideologue and a mentor to Kim Jong-il.
==::==

==::==
SEOUL, South Korea — The most senior member of the North Korean government to defect toSouth Koreawas found dead at his home in Seoul on Sunday morning, local news media reported, citing police officials. The defector, Hwang Jang-yop, 87, was the North’s former chief ideologue and a mentor to the current leader, Kim Jong-il. His death came on the same day that the North held a massive military parade in the capital, Pyongyang. The parade, attended by Mr. Kim and his youngest son and heir apparent, Kim Jong-un, marked the 65th anniversary of the founding of the Workers’ Party, which Mr. Hwang had helped to establish. Mr. Hwang, who defected in 1997, was a bitter and outspoken critic of the North Korean government, and he said he was the target of several assassination plots by the North over the years. In June, a South Korean court sentenced two North Korean army majors to 10 years in prison for conspiracy to murder Mr. Hwang. The officers had entered the South by posing as defectors, prosecutors said. But  police officials said Sunday that Mr. Hwang appeared to have died of  natural causes, apparently suffering a heart attack during his morning  bath. The Yonhap News Agency said there were no signs of a break-in at his home and that a security guard had been on duty. Mr. Hwang was a leading member ofNorth Korea’s Communist government, serving as president of Kim Il-sung University and secretary of the ruling Workers’ Party. He is said to have been the principal theoretician behind the nation’s guiding policy of “juche,” or self-reliance. In the early 1980s, however, he began to fall out of favor, and after becoming estranged from Kim Jong-il, he defected in Beijing while returning from a trip to Tokyo. He sought sanctuary in the South Korean Embassy in Beijing, and was eventually allowed to leave the country despite protests from North Korea. After he defected, Mr. Hwang’s wife and one daughter are believed to have committed suicide. His son and another daughter, and his granddaughters, were reportedly sent to prison labor camps. Mr. Hwang spent his initial years in the South under virtual house arrest, guarded by government agents. He later came to write books, make speeches and work with activist groups. “North Korean society has turned into a dark world of totalitarianism highlighted by hereditary succession of leadership and feudal patriarchy,” Mr. Hwang wrote in 2003. “The upshot of all this is famine and mass exodus of its people, while the regime spends hundreds of millions of dollars to build the mausoleum for Kim Il-sung’s dead body.”

As talks ended on Thursday, North Korea released the first official photo of Kim Jong-un, the country’s likely next leader.

SEOUL, South Korea — North Korean state media released a photograph and video of Kim Jong-un, the son and presumed heir of the ailing dictator, Kim Jong-il, the first verified images of the young man as an adult. The photo was published in the Thursday issue of North Korea’s main newspaper, Rodong Shinmun, and showed him in a dark suit with his father and a large group of senior Workers’ Party officials. He bears a strong resemblance to his father and, some thought, his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, North Korea’s founder. Video broadcast on television showed Kim Jong-un sitting in the front row of the Workers Party meeting this week, among a group of senior leaders. This week, at a landmark meeting of the Workers’ Party in the capital, Pyongyang, the younger Mr. Kim, who is believed to be 27 or 28, wasgiven the rank of four-star generalin the People’s Army and was named a deputy chairman of the party’s military commission. He also became a member of the party’s Central Committee,  an ideological and policy-making post. In the photograph, Kim Jong-un, chubby and looking somewhat older than his years, was seated two spots to his father’s right and next to another rising star, Vice Marshal Ri Yong-ho, seated between them. Mr. Ri, 67, whose military rank as vice marshal places him over Kim Jong-un, was named to the country’s powerful Politburo this week and also was made a deputy chairman of the party’s military commission. The vice marshal, who has served as chief of the army general staff, is seen as a seasoned officer with substantial field experience. South Korean news media reports have suggested that he guided Kim Jong-un in his fast-track military training over the last year and he is expected to be Mr. Kim’s tutor and guide in political and military matters. Analysts and diplomats in Washington will be watching for “the gradual insertion of the Young General into the policy and decision-making apparatus,” said Evans J. R. Revere, a longtime United States diplomat inSouth Koreaand Asia who is diplomat in residence and lecturer at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton. Young General is a title used by North Korean news media to refer to the younger Mr. Kim. “There have been several reports that he had been given a lower-level position in the National Defense Commission some months back,” Mr. Revere said, “and I expect that there have been similar efforts to expose him to the government, military and party decision-making process over the past two years.” The new North Korean appointments seemed not to have any immediate effect on North-South relations, which have been strained by the sinking in March of the South Korean warshipCheonan. While the two sides’ militaries met for the first time in two years on Thursday, the talks ended with no apparent progress and no new meetings scheduled, according to an official with South Korea’s Defense Ministry. The talks began at 10 a.m. in the border village of Panmunjom and adjourned at 11:45 a.m., said the Defense Ministry official, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. He declined to discuss the mood of the meeting. He said South Korea demanded an apology for the Cheonan sinking, which Seoul has attributed to a North Korean torpedo attack. The sinking, which occurred along the two Koreas’ disputed western sea border, killed 46 South Korean sailors. The North has denied any involvement in the Cheonan sinking and on Thursday proposed that South Korea accept a team of investigators from the North. The South refused the request, the defense official said. A statement by the United Nations Security Council in Julyexpressed “deep concern”over the Cheonan sinking, but did not find North Korea culpable. The North Korean ambassador to the United Nations told reporters at the time that the finding was “a great diplomatic victory.” Lee Sung-yoon, a professor at the Fletcher School at Tufts University, said North Korea “has closed the chapter on the Cheonan,” citing the United Nations statement. “They’re saying, ‘Let’s move on,’ ” he said. The renewal of working-level military talks was proposed this month by the North Koreans, apparently to focus on preventing naval clashes along the disputed sea border, known as the Northern Limit Line. The North has also been angered by airborne leaflets sent across the border by South Korean activists. The leaflets, which criticize and ridicule Kim Jong-il, call on North Koreans to rise up against his government. Political analysts in Seoul were reluctant to connect the sudden resumption of military negotiations to what appeared to be the emergence of Kim Jong-un as the eventual successor to his father. The North’s official Korean Central News Agency also on Thursday released a new list of the rosters of various party organizations, along with the appointments made at the Workers’ Party meeting this week in Pyongyang.

The national tragedy has buoyed the country’s once embattled conservative, pro-American president, Lee Myung-bak.
==::==

==::==
BUCHEON, South Korea — The sinking of the South Korean warshipCheonan, apparently by a North Korean torpedo, has provoked an international crisis that has embroiled big powers like the United States and China. But here inSouth Korea, it has had another effect: buoying the country’s once embattled conservative, pro-American president,Lee Myung-bak. Soon after taking office two years ago, Mr. Lee appeared at risk of losing public support, as he faced mass demonstrations on the streets of Seoul against the import of United States beef. Now, political experts are talking about the “Cheonan effect,” as polls show that more than half of expected voters approve of the president and his tougher line toward the North. Nowhere is the current upwelling of popular support more apparent than in polling for the local elections to be held across South Korea on Wednesday. Mr. Lee’s Grand National Party, whose candidates once faced tight races in some districts, now appears poised to sweep the most important races, including hotly contested mayoral elections in Seoul and the nearby port of Incheon. Kim Moon-soo, the conservative governor of a province outside Seoul, just two weeks ago was in an uphill battle for re-election against a liberal opponent. Now, polls show him with a comfortable 15 percentage point lead. “The only way to secure national security is to vote Grand National Party!” Mr. Kim recently told a crowd of flag-waving supporters, many of whom wore the sky blue of the governing party. Such colorful displays are typical of the feisty and contentious election campaigns in South Korea, one of Asia’s most robust democracies. But the emotions unleashed in March by the sinking of the Cheonan, which killed 46 sailors, made what would have been local elections fought over public works and school lunches into an important national referendum on South Korea’s stance toward the North. Politicians and political analysts agree that voters decisively turned to the Grand National Party after the announcement on May 20 of the results of an international inquiry into the sinking that foundNorth Korearesponsible. Political analysts said the results were enough to persuade many undecided voters to swing to the conservatives, who are seen as stronger on defense. “The Cheonan is having a huge effect by pushing voters to rally around the flag,” said Kim Ki-shik, a political analyst at the People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, a policy research group. A telephone poll of 800 likely voters conducted  Saturday by the East Asia Institute, a political research group, found that 52 percent of respondents approved of Mr. Lee in May, up from 46 percent a month earlier. It also found that 54 percent of respondents would “take the Cheonan into consideration” when casting ballots on Wednesday. Political analysts said the sinking also soured many of these swing voters against the liberal opposition, which favors resuming engagement with North Korea, and which had been openly skeptical about whether the North was behind the attack. Some on the left have accused the president of manipulating the inquiry’s results to enhance his party’s chances in the elections. But commentators warn that this wave of anger over the sinking does not signal unconditional support for Mr. Lee. In particular, they say that a majority of voters are against an openly confrontational stance toward the North, much less military retaliation. In fact, after years of rising living standards and lowered tensions with the North under Mr. Lee’s two liberal predecessors, most South Koreans do not have the stomach for an actual standoff, political analysts say. This means Mr. Lee must tread carefully, even as he stands with his nation’s closest allies, the United States and Japan, in calling for a firm response to the sinking. If he is seen as provoking North Korea, or pushing it too far, public sentiment could easily swing against him, analysts say. “Voters are furious at North Korea now,” said Yoon Hee-woong, director of research at the Korea Society Opinion Institute, a polling company, “but the consensus here is clearly against confrontation.” Mr. Lee’s current stance is that South Korea is willing to resume dialogue with the North, but only after it apologizes for the sinking and brings those responsible to justice. At a speech in Bucheon, a suburb about an hour from Seoul, Mr. Kim, the candidate for governor, criticized the North for the attack. He did not call for revenge, but instead said that South Korea needed to bolster its own defenses and give moral support to the president in a time of crisis. “Is this election about judging Lee Myung-bak?” he asked about 500 supporters outside a train station. “Or do we need to judge North Korea and Kim Jong-il?” he added, referring to the North Korean leader. The supporters of his opponent, Rhyu Si-min of the People’s Participation Party, grouse that the sinking of the Cheonan had hijacked the elections. “The Cheonan has crowded out all the other important issues,” said Mr. Rhyu’s chairwoman for campaign strategy, Kim Hyun-mee. In Ilsan, a nearby city,  Mr. Rhyu repeated in a hoarse voice his support for “peaceful coexistence” with the North. Among his supporters at the rally, most of them in their 20s and 30s, suspicions run deep against the president and the United States, South Korea’s longtime protector. “I don’t think North Korea did it,” said Lee Soo-hong, 39, who said he was between jobs. “I think the United States is using this incident to control South Korea.” Mr. Kim, the conservative candidate, said that his party’s tradition of closer ties to Washington was helped him with voters. “When people feel insecure, they feel the necessity of the United States,” said Mr. Kim, who paused before adding, “and the Grand National Party.”

WASHINGTON — The United States and its allies put new pressure onNorth Koreaon Monday, announcing naval exercises next month to detect submarines of the kind suspected of sinking a South Korean warship, and winning the support of the secretary general of the United Nations for Security Council action. The officials were seeking to calibrate the response to North Korea cautiously in large part because of concern about how North Korea might react. The country’s defense commission, which rarely issues public statements, has threatened direct attacks onSouth Koreaif it retaliates for the sinking of the warshipCheonan, though the North has denied responsibility for attack, which killed 46 sailors. American officials acknowledged that the types of steps announced Monday — the threat of Security Council sanctions, military maneuvers and exercises to practice intercepting North Korean ships suspected of carrying arms or nuclear technology — have been tried before over the past two decades. While some have inflicted temporary pain, they have not deterred North Korea from conducting two nuclear tests since 2006, a battery of missile tests that have yielded mixed results and the sale of nuclear and missile technology to the Middle East. The strongest statement about North Korea’s culpability came at the United Nations, from Secretary GeneralBan Ki-moon, who was foreign minister in South Korea during a failed effort at what was once called the “Sunshine Policy” of increased interchanges with the North. “There must be some measures taken,” he said at a news conference, though he stopped short of saying what those measures should be. “The evidence is quite compelling,” he added, saying he was trying to separate his personal feeling from his duties as secretary general. “There is no controversy. Therefore it is the responsibility of the international community to address this issue properly.” On a trip to Beijing, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said, “Our support for South Korea’s defense is unequivocal.” At the Pentagon, officials announced that the United States and South Korea would hold exercises in coming weeks to practice missions detecting enemy submarines and intercepting cargo vessels suspected of haulingnuclear weapons, bomb-making materials or other prohibited arms. “Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman, said one exercise would allow the South Korean and American militaries to practice antisubmarine warfare. South Korean officials said their warship was sunk by a North Korean torpedo. But the announcement also appeared to be an acknowledgement that South Korea’s submarine detection technologies left something to be desired. The Cheonan crew had no idea that a North Korean submarine was in the region, and even after the sinking, it took weeks to determine what had hit the ship. A second set of naval exercises will focus on halting banned cargo at sea, and will be held under the auspices of the Proliferation Security Initiative, a multilateral program to intercept the movement of nuclear materials, weapons and components. When that program was begun by the administration of President George W. Bush, South Korea at first refused to join, for fear of angering the North. That decision was reversed more than a year ago, but Seoul is now willing to participate in exercises in how to track North Korean ships and force them into port. Although the White House released a statement early Monday morning that assailed North Korea for its “belligerent and threatening” behavior and promised close military cooperation between the United States and South Korea, Pentagon officials later in the day spoke in cautious tones , and stressed that the issue should be resolved through diplomatic efforts . “Obviously, the goal here is not to increase tensions or do things that are going to look overly provocative or add to the tension in the region,” said one senior military officer. “At the same time, we want to make sure we are ready to support the South Koreans throughout this issue.” American officials say there are no plans to bolster the American troop presence in South Korea, which has dwindled to about 26,000, about half the number of troops in the region during the nuclear crises of 1994 and 2002-2003. In the 1994 crisis — when North Korea threatened military action if its nuclear program was referred to the Security Council for action — President Bill Clinton was preparing to reinforce the American military presence on the peninsula. Since then, South Korea’s own capabilities have improved considerably, American officials say. And the United States maintains the ability to strike from a distance with weapons aboard American warships and combat aircraft. But the North also has a larger stockpile of nuclear fuel, enough for eight or more nuclear weapons, which clearly factors into the calculations being made in Seoul and Washington. The United States will also have to take the lead in Security Council action — at the same time it is trying to win its approval of sanctions on Iran. Both resolutions will require Chinese support, and so far China has not acknowledged North Korean culpability, much less discussed sanctions or other punishment. American officials noted that while South Korea announced a nearly total cutoff of trade with the North on Monday, the amounts are small enough that China could make up the difference. South Korean officials said their nation would sever nearly all trade with North Korea, deny North Korean merchant ships use of South Korean sea lanes and ask the Security Council to punish the North. In addition, the South’s military moved to resume “psychological warfare” propaganda broadcasts at the border after six years.

South Korea’s assessment that North Korea began its uranium enrichment program much earlier than thought raised fears that North Korea could be closer to producing bomb fuel than what was previously thought.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreaapparently began pursuing a uranium enrichment program  in 1996 at the latest, the South Korean foreign minister said Wednesday, bolstering fears that  the North’s second route to building a nuclear bomb could  be well on its way.. The North’s  nuclear program has long focused on  a  plutonium-making complex in Yongbyon, north of its capital. The country  acknowledged for the first time last April that it intended to enrich uranium as well. In June, it said its enrichment program was in an “experimental stage” while bitterly denouncing the United Nations for tightening sanctions after its nuclear test in May. In September, North Korea said its “experimental uranium enrichment” had entered a “completion phase.” But the South Korean minister, Yu Myung-hwan, said Wednesday, “It appears that North Korea started its uranium enrichment program at least in 1996.”  Speaking to  the Yonhap news agency,  in comments confirmed by his office, he said, “What’s clear is that the North began enriched uranium development quite early.” Mr. Yu said many things remained unclear:  “how far the program has advanced, how much enriched uranium and how manynuclear weaponsthey have.” He did not elaborate beyond saying that Seoul was in close consultation with Washington and other allies. For years before North Korea officially announced the uranium program, American and South Korean officials had urged it to come clean on suspicions that it was pursuing uranium enrichment with technological help from Pakistani nuclear scientists. North Korea said last year that it began the uranium enrichment to make fuel for nuclear power plants it hopes to build in the future. Both enriched uranium and plutonium can also be turned into fuel for atomic bombs. In 1994, North Korea agreed to freeze and then dismantle the complex in Yongbyon. That facility, the only nuclear arms program the North has acknowledged,  produced enough plutonium for at least half a dozen bombs, according to  American estimates. The 1994 deal collapsed in 2002 when North Korea rejected American demands that it respond to allegations that it was violating the accord by secretly pursuing uranium enrichment. Even after six-nation talks began in 2003 to try to produce a new agreement under which North Korea would give up its weapons program, the North tried to keep the talks focused on its Yongbyon program. Its refusal to discuss enrichment eventually helped scuttle the six-nation talks in late 2008. By then, North Korea had already demolished part of the Yongbyon facilities in return for Washington’s agreement to remove it from its list of state sponsors of terrorism. During most of last year, North Korea pursued confrontation, conducting a nuclear test in May and test-firing a series of ballistic missiles. Last autumn, it began sending signals for talks. The enrichment issue has added new urgency to resuming the six-nation talks, according to experts. North Korea is believed to be months, if not years, away from restarting its plutonium-producing reactor in Yongbyon. Mr. Yu said he expected North Korea to return to the six-nation talks. But he denounced the North’s latest demand that the United States negotiate a peace treaty to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War before it considers giving up its nuclear weapons. “That’s like saying it will never give up its nuclear programs, or it is a delaying tactic” to buy time to further its nuclear programs, he said. Mr. Yu, who has expressed doubts in the past that North Korea will give up its nuclear arms, called for continued enforcement of United Nations sanctions.

One must never speak ill of nonchronological storytelling in America, where it is considered innately more serious than the other kind. But it is worth pondering the fact that flashbacks are nowhere more common than in North Korea. A writer will start with a woman getting a medal, say, then explain how she got there; this approach leaves less room for intellectual uncertainty and divergent responses. I make the point because although Hwang Sok-yong’s “Old Garden” was written south of the 38th parallel, it resembles a North Korean narrative in structural as in ideological ways. This is not a good thing. If I never read another mournful account of the fall of the Berlin Wall, it will be too soon. “The Old Garden” begins interestingly enough. The description of a former political prisoner’s first day of freedom after almost 20 years, when the mere sight of open space exhausts him, is vivid and moving. (Hwang, one of South Korea’s most famous novelists, was himself a dissident who served prison time after an unsanctioned visit to the North.) Unfortunately the protagonist, Hyun Woo, soon learns that his lover and comrade Yoon Hee has died of cancer, whereupon the novel starts going back and forth in time. We read her letters to him, his cards to her, and so on. Much of this correspondence is of the implausible kind in which the recipient is reminded in great detail of shared experiences, but the transition to Yoon Hee’s notebooks from the 1980s does not help matters. To recount the student movement’s struggle against Chun Doo Hwan in such a disjointed and meandering fashion is to take all the drama out of it. Jay Oh’s translation is basically functional, but it feels too youthful and distinctly American. The standard Korean expression for “24 hours a day” is rendered into English as “24/7,” a word meaning “shy” becomes “totally embarrassed,” and so on; this is hardly how a middle-aged man emerging from a long prison term would express himself. Other characters are made to swear in ways that could not seem less Korean: “Jesus, my mouth is watering.” The original at least has more gravitas — but that’s about it. Especially baffling is the author’s choice of a narrator. Hyun Woo is a man for whom “everything is unexciting and ordinary,” and he obviously wants us to feel the same way. Indeed, the students’ opposition to the Chun regime is taken so much for granted that they barely seem to think at all, let alone engage in moral or philosophical debate. Does Hwang know how fatuous they sound? His later novel “The Guest” (which preceded this one into English translation) is a more nuanced affair, but here there is little sign of a critical or ironic distance between the author and his characters. When Hyun Woo says the Kwangju massacre of 1980 made him realize “our enemy was not the North,” we are evidently to agree that this was the only possible conclusion. And when another man explains his newfound sympathy for Pyongyang with the words “I just decided to be on their side, O.K.?” (the Valley Girl tones of the translation are not always inappropriate), we are to feel something other than the urge to hurl him across the DMZ. Yoon Hee, who is clearly the author’s favorite, grows more insufferable with every page. Having chosen to live in West Berlin, she is horrified when East Germany collapses, and worries that North Korea may follow suit. “This is not the solution. At least they had the correct beginning, didn’t they?” The striving for simplicity and emotionality among students bewildered by long reading lists is, as the historian Ernst Nolte once wrote, “almost disgustingly easy to explain.” Harder to understand is why a man of Hwang’s age and experience would want to present this striving as something the world needs more of. (According to the publisher, Hwang is organizing a “peace train” that will go from Paris through North to South Korea — though I suspect he wants to stay on until Stockholm.) Having studied in Seoul in the mid-1980s, and witnessed the bravery of the demonstrators on many occasions, I was ready to like Hwang’s characters for helping to end military rule. Alas, he has so little apparent respect for the ensuing bourgeois democracy that he describes them cursing the transition to it. The hunch that we are dealing here with an ideology even sillier than Marxism is confirmed in one of Yoon Hee’s lines: “It’s a fight that has continued for over a hundred years since we opened up the port.” In other words, Korea’s problems began when it ceased to be the Hermit Kingdom. The penny drops: this is how the students could have fought so heroically against a pro-American dictator in Seoul, yet found so little cause to criticize the paranoid nationalist thugs in Pyongyang. “The Old Garden” thus raises an interesting question despite itself. Should we admire these people for making South Korea less like North Korea, if they were aiming for the opposite effect?

After a cooling of relations, the two Koreas held their first major political meeting in nearly two years on Sunday.

SEOUL,South Korea— The North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, sent a message of improving ties with South Korea through his high-level delegation, which met with the South’s president,Lee Myung-bak, in Seoul on Sunday in the first major political meeting between the two Koreas in nearly two years, officials said. During a 30-minute meeting, the North Korean delegation relayed Mr. Kim’s “verbal message regarding making progress in South-North cooperation,” Lee Dong-kwan, Mr. Lee’s chief spokesman, told reporters. “To this, President Lee explained our government’s consistent and firm policy towardNorth Koreaand asked the delegates to relay his position to Chairman Kim.” The South Korean leader stressed the need for dialogue, his spokesman said. The North Korean delegation was led by Kim Ki-nam, a secretary of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party, and Kim Yang-gon, the North’s intelligence chief, who also handles relations with South Korea. The two are among Kim Jong-il’s most trusted aides. Unification Minister Hyun In-taek of South Korea, who met with Kim Yang-gon for 80 minutes on Saturday, had earlier said he hoped that the North Korean delegates’ meeting with President Lee “will become a turning point in South-North Korean relations.” The North Korean delegation flew to Seoul on Friday to pay its respects to former President Kim Dae-jung of South Korea. Mr. Kim, a champion of inter-Korean reconciliation who in 2000 met Kim Jong-il, died Tuesday. The funeral was set for Sunday. The trip was widely seen as an opportunity for Kim Jong-il to reach out to Seoul. After months of raising tensions with nuclear and missile tests, North Korea has appeared to be shifting its tone in recent weeks. North Korean officials met with former President Bill Clinton in Pyongyang, the North’s capital, on Aug. 4, and then released two American journalists and a South Korean worker, all of whom had been held in the North for months on charges of committing hostile acts against the North. Last week, North Korea lifted restrictions on cross-border traffic with South Korea. In a separate meeting on Saturday with South Korean politicians and scholars, Kim Yang-gon suggested more economic ties between the two Koreas, voicing hopes of shipping some of the North’s rich minerals to the South, Yonhap, a South Korean news agency, reported, quoting people who attended the meeting. Relations between the North and the South have cooled since Mr. Lee took office in February 2008. Mr. Lee vowed not to provide aid to the North unless it made concrete progress in dismantling itsnuclear weaponsprogram. The North lashed out by cutting off dialogue and calling him a “traitor.”

HONG KONG —A high-level North Korean delegation that traveled toSouth Koreato pay respects to the late PresidentKim Dae-jungwill meet on Saturday with South Korea’s unification minister, the South Korean government announced on Friday. to The meeting, the first between the countries since a conservative government came into power last year, would be the latest in a series of conciliatory steps from the North Koreans. Earlier this month, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, pardoned two American journalists after former President Bill Clinton flew to Pyongyang.North Koreais also easing border restrictions and allowing the resumption of tourism. The six-member North Korean delegation, which includes two envoys known to be close advisers to Mr. Kim, arrived in Seoul on Friday afternoon and were met at the airport by the deputy head of South Korea’s Unification Ministry, Hong Yang-ho, and a former chief minister, Jeong Se-hyun. The group went directly from the airport to lay a funeral wreath at the memorial altar erected at the National Assembly. Along the way, apparently, the leader of the North Korean entourage, Kim Ki-nam, a senior official in the North Korea Workers’ Party, let his hosts know he was in a chatty mood. “I’ll meet with everybody. Let’s meet to talk,” he told Mr. Hong, the Yonhap news agency reported. Kim Dae-jung, the South Korean president from 1998 to 2003,died Tuesdayat age 83. His presidency was marked by a landmarksummit meeting in Pyongyangwith Kim Jong-il in June 2000 and by his “sunshine policy” of increased aid and trade that eased relations with the North. North Korea proposed on Wednesday to send a condolence delegation to Seoul — a rare event in inter-Korean relations — and the South Korean government agree to the trip on Thursday.

SEOUL,South Korea— One day after its nuclear test drew angry and widespread condemnation,North Koreafurther antagonized the international community on Tuesday by test-firing three short-range missiles. In addition, a South Korean newspaper reported on Wednesday that American spy satellites had detected plumes of steam and other signs of activity at a North Korean plant that reprocesses spent nuclear fuel to make weapons-grade plutonium. The report from the newspaper, Chosun Ilbo, appeared to support a claim by North Korea in late April that it had restarted its reprocessing plant at Yongbyon, 60 miles north of Pyongyang, the capital. The missile firings came just hours after South Korea said it would join an American-led initiative  to stop the global trafficking in unconventional weapons. The North responded Wednesday by reiterating its position that it would consider it a declaration of war if South Korea actually stopped and searched any North Korean ships as part of that program. The developments sharpened the confrontation between North Korea and much of the world — especially the United States — as the United Nations Security Council vowed to fashion a resolution that could impose further sanctions on the increasingly belligerent North. The missiles launched Tuesday were surface-to-ship and surface-to-air projectiles, a South Korean official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters. The South Korean news agency Yonhap said the missiles had a range of 80 miles. They were apparently launched from a base on the eastern coast into the sea opposite Japan, further rattling nerves in the region. There was no official comment on the missile firings by either the North Korean authorities or the South Korean Defense Ministry. After its nuclear test on Monday, its second in less than three years, the North test-fired three short-range missiles, also off its east coast. An intelligence official in Seoul said that move indicated that North Korea was “getting its back up” about the possibility that United States military aircraft would fly near North Korea in an effort to collect radiation data from the nuclear blast. At the Pentagon, officials said the military on Tuesday sent a specially designed surveillance plane into international airspace around North Korea to collect particles from the test. The airplane has high-technology “sniffers” on board to collect radioactive materials that might have seeped up from the underground test. The particles from the first surveillance flight were to be sent to laboratories in the United States, and a second flight was planned over the next day or two, officials said. South Korea’s long-delayed participation in theProliferation Security Initiative, a program to curb trafficking in unconventional weapons, followed a statement on Monday by the Security Council that unanimously condemned the nuclear test and called it a “clear violation” of a previous resolution. At the United Nations, the five permanent Security Council members and Japan and South Korea met for 90 minutes  Tuesday to discuss possible new sanctions as well as ways to strengthen provisions in a 2006 resolution that have never been put into effect, like halting and inspecting North Korean vessels at sea. Ambassadors were tight-lipped about potential new sanctions, and diplomats said no written proposals had begun to circulate. All seven nations were said to have agreed on the need to send a strong message to North Korea. “We are in agreement on the goals,” said Susan E. Rice, the American ambassador. But the Chinese ambassador, Zhang Yesui, deflected questions about how strong a resolution his country would support. In Japan, the lower house of Parliament unanimously adopted a resolution on Tuesday condemning the North’s nuclear test, and it threatened to step up sanctions against the North. “Japan, as the world’s only nation to ever suffer a nuclear attack, cannot condone” North Korea’s repeated nuclear tests, the resolution said. North Korea’s recent belligerence has also prompted Japan’s governing party to debate whether Tokyo should consider pre-emptive strikes against states considered hostile — actions that would probably require changes to Japan’s pacifist Constitution. North Korea appeared unfazed by the world’s condemnation, which included strong rebukes from allies like China and Russia. On Tuesday in Rodong Sinmun, the North’s main Communist Party newspaper, North Korea declared that it was “fully ready for battle” against the United States, accusing President Obama of “following in the footsteps of the previous Bush administration’s reckless policy of militarily stifling North Korea.” North Korean officials have said that South Korea’s full membership in the initiative would be seen as a “declaration of undisguised confrontation and a declaration of a war.” The international effort was begun in 2003 by the Bush administration in order to interdict shipments — especially at sea — that were suspected of containing unconventional weapons, their related materials and delivery systems. Russia, Britain, France and Israel are among the 95 signers of  the initiative, which India, Pakistan and China did not sign. South Korea had wavered on joining the initiative for fear of provoking the North. But on Tuesday, President Lee Myung-bak, who came to power with a promise to take a tougher approach toward the North, spoke with Mr. Obama about the North Korean threat and the South’s decision to join the effort. On the phone, Mr. Lee emphasized to Mr. Obama that the United States and its allies “should not repeat the pattern” of “rewarding” North Korea’s provocations with dialogue and economic aid, as they did afterthe North’s first nuclear testin October 2006.

BAENGNYEONG ISLAND,South Korea— Less than 10 miles from here,North Koreahas amassed two army divisions, artillery and rockets — pointed directly at South Korea. Should war break out, planes from the North would arrive in less than four minutes. And according to the South Korean military, the five North Korean naval squadrons stationed in coves on the opposite shore would send out 360 war vessels, including 13 submarines, all of them swarming toward this island, the northernmost in South Korea. For its part, South Korea’s Sixth Marine Brigade, the Black Dragons, would move tanks and shore guns out of bunkers here and unleash a barrage. Then 4,000 South Korean marines hunkered down in the hills would charge out. “We will strike the enemy’s side like a dagger,” Lt. Chung Kyong-min, a South Korean marine detachment commander, said on a rare visit to his hilltop observation post. This is the kind of mistrust and unrelenting hostility that Christopher R. Hill, the American assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, will face when he crosses the inter-Korean border on Wednesday to try to persuade North Korea to stop its efforts to reactivate its nuclear weapons complex. The tensions, a half-century old, pose an obstacle not only to disarmament, but also to the ambitious deal, announced on Monday, to import $90 billion worth of Russian natural gas into South Korea. In Moscow, President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea, and his Russian counterpart, Dmitri A. Medvedev, sealed a deal that would send 10 billion cubic meters of natural gas in Siberia to South Korea over 30 years, starting in 2015. But they still have to persuade North Korea to let a pipeline pass through its territory. Otherwise, they will have to opt for a more costly delivery route, like an undersea pipeline that takes a detour around the North. Mr. Hill’s trip to Pyongyang, North Korea’s capital, at the invitation of the North Koreans is widely seen as a last-ditch effort of the administration of President Bush in its waning months to salvage an agreement on nuclear disarmament. That deal began crumbling in recent weeks as the United States demanded inspections to check whether North Korea was hiding any nuclear activities other than those at the declared complex in Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang. Without a North Korean agreement to allow such inspections, Washington refused to give the North the reward it had sought: removing the country from America’s list of state sponsors of terrorism. Calling the demand a slight to its sovereignty, North Korea has lashed out. It has removed United Nations seals on its nuclear facilities in Yongbyon and has threatened to restart, as early as this week, a plant there that can turn spent nuclear fuel into weapons-grade plutonium. A challenge for Mr. Hill is whether he can work out a compromise verification mechanism that satisfies Congress in an election year and the North Koreans, who have turned more aggressive despite reports that their leader, Kim Jong-il, is ill. Mr. Hill is the first senior Western official to visit Pyongyang since reports emerged in early September that Mr. Kim had suffered a stroke, prompting speculation over who is in charge in North Korea, which is armed with long-range missiles and enough plutonium to make about six nuclear bombs. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice “believes it’s important for Chris to go out to the region, particularly to go to Pyongyang, to get a sense on the ground as to what’s going on,” said her deputy spokesman, Robert Wood. The United States suspects that besides its plutonium program based in Yongbyon, North Korea has been pursuing uranium enrichment and exporting nuclear technology to countries like Syria. The North says it never has — a denial Washington wants to verify through comprehensive inspections, including random visits and the taking of samples in all sites suspected of being involved in nuclear activities, including some undeclared military sites. A senior South Korean government official close to nuclear negotiations, however, has indicated that Washington is working on a compromise that would offer a less strident inspection regime. “You have to be intrusive at the end of the day,” said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. “But you cannot achieve everything all at once. We can do this in an incremental way. We can move from the easy parts to the difficult.” Mr. Hill had earlier sent North Korea a new, toned-down verification mechanism. But the North did not respond and instead began reassembling its Yongbyon complex, part of which had been disabled under a nuclear disarmament deal struck in February last year. Mr. Hill said he would consult with his South Korean counterpart, Kim Sook, on Tuesday before crossing into North Korea through a border checkpoint north of Seoul, the South Korean capital. “There is concern that Rice and Hill have lost momentum to work out an efficient compromise with North Korea, given Washington’s preoccupation with the financial crisis and presidential election,” said Ryoo Kihl-jae, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies and a member of the board of North Korea policy advisers for Mr. Lee. Mr. Hill’s strategy so far has been to nudge North Korea toward nuclear disarmament through a sequence of rewards intended to build trust. But he faced pressure from conservatives in Washington who insisted on placing a rigorous verification mechanism on the North, which has cheated before and has a tough road to persuade Washington that it would truly give up its nuclear weapons. The degree to which such mistrust and enmity drive politics here is evident along the inter-Korean border, especially on this frontier island of 20 square miles. Baengnyeong is the only place in South Korea where high school students and homemakers still join regular military drills with live ammunition. North Korea has never accepted the sea border around this island. The two navies clashed in bloody skirmishes not far from here, in 1999 and 2002. Last year alone, said Lieutenant Chung of the South Korean Marine Corps, North Korean gunboats violated the sea border 20 times. Also, he said, planes from the North came within 25 miles of the border before turning around “in an intentional provocation to raise military tension.” But Maj. Han No-soo, a spokesman with the Sixth Marine Brigade, said there had been no unusual movement on either side since news emerged about Mr. Kim’s ill health. On this garrisonlike island, every strip of beach where enemy troops might be able to land is guarded by mines, steel columns and concrete walls. But the island’s 4,500 civilian residents go about their business all the same, catching crabs and catering to tourists. “We hear the marines fire up their guns in exercises so often and so long,” said Kim Eung-gyun, 47, a Baengnyeong resident, “that we won’t know if there is a war until an enemy artillery shell drops right at our feet.”

DORASAN STATION,South Korea— For President Roh Moo-hyun, who steps down in February and is barred from running for another term, the journey on Tuesday of a 12-car South Korean freight train across the world’s most heavily fortified border on Tuesday was one of the last hurrahs of his reconciliation policy with the Communist North. The opening of regular cargo rail service between the two Koreas for the first time in 56 years came a week before South Korea’s presidential election. The man who appears almost certain to succeed Mr. Roh — the conservative front-runner, Lee Myung-bak — has vowed to review all the major joint economic projects Mr. Roh agreed to with the North during his final months in office. “If elected, Mr. Lee will link economic cooperation with the North’s denuclearization,” said Nam Sung-wook, a professor at Korea University and aNorth Koreapolicy adviser to Mr. Lee. “The Roh government equated engaging the North with embracing it,” Mr. Nam said. “But Mr. Lee believes that engagement should include sticks too. He will offer carrots if North Korea behaves well, but will use sticks if it doesn’t.” In recent months, Mr. Roh and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, have agreed on a series of economic projects estimated to be worth as much as $15 billion, with Mr. Roh hoping that the momentum toward reconciliation will be hard to break, no matter who becomes the next president in the South in the Dec. 19 election. Mr. Roh has said that he sees no alternative to helping the North rebuild its economy. A stable North Korea will help South Korea attract foreign investors and reduce the cost of eventual reunification, he says. On Tuesday, Lee Chul, the head of the South Korean national railway, saw the northbound train off from Dorasan, the last station on the South Korean side of the border. “This is a deeply emotional moment for Koreans,” he said. “Today, we link our arteries,” he added. The freight rail service inaugurated Tuesday is scheduled to operate five times a week on a track about 10 miles long. Cross-border train service was cut in 1951, during the Korean War, which ended two years later in a cease-fire rather than with a peace treaty, leaving the two Koreas technically at war. Although hundreds of motor vehicles already cross the border daily, resuming the inter-Korean rail line has been a top ambition of recent South Korean leaders, who hoped it would bolster trade between the Koreas and provide South Korea with a cheaper, faster way of carrying its exports to the Chinese, Russian and European markets. But for now, the rail line links only the South Korean border town of Munsan with Kaesong, a North Korean frontier city where South Koreans run factories with inexpensive North Korean labor. On Tuesday, it carried curbstones for roads and raw materials for shoes. Hours later, it returned to the South with finished shoes, garments and hydraulic pumps, all made in Kaesong. Next year, a North Korean train will take over the daily shuttle. When Mr. Roh met with Mr. Kim in Pyongyang in October, South Korea agreed to help the North renovate its main rail line between Kaesong and Sinuiju, North Korea’s main entry point to China. The project could cost $150 million, according to officials in Seoul. “I fear that the two governments struck many deals ahead of the election in the South, hoping that the next government in the South will have no choice but to honor them,” Mr. Lee, the presidential candidate for the opposition Grand National Party, said in a newspaper interview last week. “But I will scrutinize each of those agreements to see if they are justified, or if they should be considered only after North Korea dismantles its nuclear weapons programs.”

SEOUL,South Korea—  President Roh Moo-hyun of South Korea called on Tuesday for a meeting of the leaders of the United States, China and the two Koreas to speed upNorth Korea’s denuclearization and achieve a peace treaty on the divided Korean Peninsula. When Mr. Roh met with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, in October, they agreed on the need for negotiations  to formally conclude the Korean War. That conflict ended in 1953 in a cease-fire rather than a peace treaty, leaving the peninsula technically in a state of war. But until Tuesday no leader had publicly called for such a summit meeting, which would bring the leaders of all four major parties to the Korean War together for the first time. The United States and North Korean leaders have never met. A major step toward a formal peace would almost certainly bolster  the political legacy of Mr. Roh, who will leave  office in February. The Constitution  bars him from running  in the Dec. 19 presidential election. Speaking to an international security forum on Tuesday, Mr. Roh noted that time was also running out for President Bush, whose second term ends in January 2009. “The reason that we are suggesting a four-way summit is simple: It’s aimed at persuading North Korea to carry out its nuclear dismantlement promise at an early date,” Mr. Roh said. “We can never say the Bush administration has enough time.” Mr. Bush has been skeptical, saying he would not meet with Mr. Kim until  North Korea dismantled its nuclear weapons programs. The White House had  no immediate reaction  to Mr. Roh’s proposal. In South Korea conservative critics have accused Mr. Roh of using the North Korean issue to improve his liberal camp’s chances in the election next month. They have said Mr. Roh might attempt to offer North Korea a peace treaty even before the North has abandoned its nuclear weapons, a prospect his aides have dismissed. Mr. Roh’s call occurred a day before the prime ministers of North and South Korea were scheduled to meet in Seoul to discuss carrying out  agreements from the October summit, which called for more economic cooperation, as well as moving toward a summit meeting on a peace treaty. He said that if the leaders of the four nations came together and declared their commitment to signing a peace treaty, it would give impetus to six-nation talks aimed at ending North Korea’s nuclear programs. The six-nation talks also include Russia and Japan. In 2005, North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear programs in return for economic aid and a peace treaty with Washington. But six-nation efforts to carry out that deal have made only piecemeal progress because of what Mr. Roh called “deep mutual suspicion” between Washington and Pyongyang. On Tuesday Mr. Roh urged Mr. Bush to be more flexible, arguing that the United States had an advantage. If North Korea does not keep its promise to abandon nuclear weapons, he said, the United States has the option of quickly restoring economic sanctions. However, once North Korea gives up its nuclear card, he said, it would take years for the country to “prepare a new tool for pressure.” The South Korean foreign minister, Song Min-soon, and the Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met in Washington last week, and according to the South Korean government, they agreed to “study ways of consolidating political wills of the highest level” among the regional powers in order to speed up North Korea’s denuclearization. Mr. Roh said today that it was the right time for a four-way meeting  because North Korea began disabling its nuclear facilities last week and was about to enter a much more difficult phase of negotiations on how to dismantle the facilities and dispose of the North’s plutonium stockpiles and nuclear weapons. North Korea says it has built nuclear weapons as a “self-defense measure” and insists that it will not give them up until Washington guarantees its security by lifting sanctions and signing a peace treaty.

SEOUL,South Korea, Aug. 18  (AP) — North and South Korea agreed Saturday to postpone a  summit meeting until early October because of recent floods that devastated the impoverished communist North. The North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, had been scheduled  to sit down  with  South Korea’s president,Roh Moo-hyun, in Pyongyang Aug. 28 to 30 for the first top-level  meeting between the countries in seven years. That has now been rescheduled for Oct. 2 to 4, the  Koreas said. The North, in unusual openness,  has said a week of storms destroyed 11 percent of its  rice and corn fields. On Saturday, state television showed inundated rice paddies, cornfields and streets, saying the downpours inflicted “unprecedented” damage. The number of dead and missing  has risen to more than 300, according to an aid group operating in the country. On Friday, South Korea offered the North a $7.5 million  aid package.

MUNSAN,South Korea, May 17 — Trains crossed the border between North and South Korea on Thursday for the first time in 56 years, an event both sides described as a milestone for reconciliation on the divided Korean Peninsula. As white balloons soared into a blue sky, soldiers swung open gates topped with barbed wire shortly after noon to let the five cars of the South Korean train cross the 2.5-mile-wide demilitarized zone, the world’s most heavily armed border, and enterNorth Korea. At the same time, about 144 miles east, a North Korean train trundled down the coast. Although these were technically just one-time test runs on two short stretches of railroad that were linked through the demilitarized zone several years ago, their symbolic importance was unmistakable. The last trains that crossed the border carried refugees and wounded soldiers to South Korea from the North during the Korean War in 1951. Photographs of the bullet-scarred, rusting hulks of wartime locomotives trapped in the demilitarized zone have symbolized a divided Korea and a conflict that has never been formally resolved, because the war ended in a truce, not a treaty. “These are not just test runs,” said South Korea’s unification minister, Lee Jae-joung. “They mean reconnecting the severed bloodline of the Korean nation.” He spoke during a ceremony at Munsan Station, about seven miles  south of the demilitarized zone. “The trains carry our dream of peace.” His North Korean counterpart, Kwon Ho-ung, who was also in Munsan, said the trains represented the “Korean nation’s wish to gallop to the destination of reunification,” despite what he called outside forces — apparently a reference to the United States — that are “not happy with reconciliation among Koreans.” The South Korean train, carrying 150 people from both sides of the border, pulled out of Munsan around 11:30 a.m. as fireworks exploded overhead. It traveled about 15 miles to Kaesong, a North Korean border town where South Korea runs factories employing less-costly labor from the North. The North Korean train had a similar journey, from the Mount Kumgang resort to Jejin, 15 miles to the south. South Korea has long dreamed of building a trans-Korea railroad that would connect its trains to China and to the Trans-Siberian Railway.  A route through North Korea would provide overland access to the rest of Asia. A trans-Korea railroad would offer a faster and cheaper way for South Korea to send exports that are now shipped by sea to China and Europe. It would also provide a shortcut for Russian oil and other natural resources transported to South Korea. Such a rail system would save South Korea $34 to $50 a ton in shipping costs, said Lim Jae-kyung, a researcher at the Korea Transport Institute. But  creating such a system, transportation analysts and government officials say, would  require years of confidence-building talks and billions of dollars in investment in North Korea’s decrepit rail system. Officials acknowledge that North Korea will probably have to give up its nuclear weapons and improve its human rights record before it could attract significant investment from South Korea or international development aid. Six-nation talks aimed at ending North Korea’s nuclear weapons programs have been stalled for months. “I cannot understand why we should give rice, flour, fertilizer and everything else the North Koreans want when they don’t do anything for us,” said Hong Moo-sun, 71, one of a dozen South Koreans protesting just outside Munsan Station on Thursday. The protesters were calling for North Korea to return their relatives, among the hundreds of people taken to North Korea after the war and believed to be held there against their will. Members of the Grand National Party, part of the conservative opposition, called the event on Thursday a “train of illusion” organized to draw voters’ attention in an election year. South Korean officials say a trans-Korea railroad would invigorate inter-Korean trade, which tripled to $1.35 billion last year from $430 million in 2000. It would also bring cash to North Korea, which could collect an estimated $150 million a year in transit fees from trains that pass through its territory, Mr. Lim, the researcher, said. But procuring international aid to renovate the rail network and letting trains from one of Asia’s most vibrant economies, carrying exports and tourists, rumble through its isolated territory could threaten the North Korean government, experts say. They say North Korea now relies on keeping its people ignorant of the outside world to maintain its totalitarian grip on power. Both Koreas agreed in 2000 to reconnect their rail systems, which had been severed by aerial bombing during the war. It took three years to relink the tracks on the west and east ends of the border. After four more years of haggling and delays, the North Korean military agreed this month to allow the one-time test runs. The agreement came after South Korea promised to send North Korea 400,000 tons of rice, as well as $80 million worth of raw materials for shoes, soap and textiles. South Korea has spent $589 million on reconnecting the rail system, including $195 million worth of equipment, tracks and other material lent  to North Korea. South Korean policy makers  have called for patience in working toward reconciliation with the North. They have often been accused by conservative politicians and civic groups of giving in to North Korea’s strategy of extracting economic aid for every step toward reconciliation. “This is a precious first step for a 1,000-mile journey,” Mr. Lee, the unification minister, said Thursday.

North Korea said today that it would postpone groundbreaking test runs of trains across the DMZ. The runs scheduled for Thursday along rebuilt railroads would have been the first time trains crossed the border since June 1951, and were a high-profile part of detente efforts between North and South Korea since a pivotal summit meeting of their leaders in 2000. The official Korean Central News Agency blamed the postponement on the failure of the two Koreas to reach a military agreement on operation of the trains.

To the Editor: Re “North Korea Wants to Make a Deal” (Op-Ed, Sept. 16): Former President Jimmy Carter writes that the “positive messages from North Korea should be pursued aggressively and without delay.” What Mr. Carter omits is as telling as what he writes. The sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean Navy ship, last March 26 is hardly a message of peaceful intentions. But Mr. Carter doesn’t even note this hostile action. Deciphering North Korea’s intentions has always been a dangerous game. Ignoring the reality of the North’s actions could have disastrous consequences for both the United States and South Korea.

SEOUL, South Korea —South Koreasaid Monday that it would send 5,000 tons of rice and other relief goods to victims of recent floods inNorth Korea, two days after the North proposed reunions of families separated by the Korean War. The conciliatory gestures indicated that the two Koreas were testing ways of easing tensions that  escalated after the sinking of a South Korean warship in March. The two had exchanged harsh language, with the South curtailing trade and staging military exercises while the North threatened retaliation. South Korea’s aid also includes 10,000 tons of cement, as well as instant noodles and medicine. It excludes heavy construction equipment that North Korea had requested but that the South fears could be used for military purposes. The aid package, worth about $8.5 million, is a fraction of the more than 300,000 tons of rice and other aid South Korea used to ship to the North annually until President Lee Myung-bak took office in early 2008. But it was the first major aid shipment to the North since the South Korean warship, theCheonan, was sunk. The sinking, which killed 46 sailors, drove relations between the two Koreas to their lowest point in years. South Korea accused the North of torpedoing the ship, while the North called the accusation a fabrication and warmongering by Seoul. The two Koreas’ cautious move toward easing tensions came as Stephen W. Bosworth, Washington’s top envoy on North Korea, met South Korean officials in Seoul on Monday as part of a regional trip focused on restarting the deadlocked six-country talks onNorth Korea’s nuclear program. The nuclear talks have not been convened since late 2008. The sinking of the South Korean ship further complicated efforts to restart the talks. Yoo Chong-ha, chief of the South Korean Red Cross, proposed Monday that officials of the two Koreas meet  Friday at the large North Korean industrial town Kaesong to arrange family reunions. Over the weekend, North Korea suggested a new round of reunions in its clearest gesture of reconciliation since the sinking. There is no direct mail or telephone connection between the two Koreas, divided into bitter enemies at the end of World War II. Although more than 20,000 Koreans have been briefly reunited through face-to-face meetings or by video since the first Korean summit in 2000, many more aging people await a chance to see relatives from whom they have been separated for 60 years.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreawarned South Korean fishermen on Tuesday to stay away from disputed border waters and threatened a “strong physical retaliation” against a  coming South Korean naval drills. The drills —  five days of  antisubmarine exercises starting Thursday — were scheduled  in response to the sinking in March of a South Korean  warships near the disputed western sea border that killed 46 sailors.South Koreasaid a  North Korean torpedo split the ship, theCheonan,  in two. On Tuesday, North Korea’s western military command  “made a decisive resolution to counter the reckless naval firing projected by the group of traitors with strong physical retaliation,” said a statement carried by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency. It warned civilian ships not to approach waters around five South Korean border islands, where South Korean marines were expected to fire weapons in exercise. It threatened to “return fire for fire.” North Korea regularly issues dire warnings. It threatened nuclear retaliation over the South joint naval and air exercise with the United States in the waters off the Korean peninsula last week, drills meant as a show of force directed at the North. South Korea and the United States will conduct yet more joint exercises Aug. 16-26. In December, the North  threatened to fire shells into the disputed waters  to enforce its claims. Later, both militaries fired shells, but they did not attack each other,  nor did their shells cross the so-called Northern Limit Line, which was drawn unilaterally by the United Nations forces at the end of the 1950-3 Korean War. It  is patrolled by South Korea and the United States. North Korea has never accepted the line as a legitimate border and claims waters many miles south of it. On Tuesday, it called the South Korean naval exercise a “direct military invasion.” A spokesman for the South Korean military said, “North Korea should stop talking nonsense and instead should admit responsibility for the Cheonan sinking and apologize.” He  who spoke on his department’s condition of anonymity. The two Korean navies fought skirmishes around the disputed border in 1999, 2002 and in November. In March, South Korea says, a North Korean submarine slipped into the disputed waters and launched a torpedo at the South Korean ship patrolling there — a claim vehemently denied by the North.

Moves by President Lee Myung-bak amounted to the most serious actions the South could take short of an armed retaliation for what Mr. Lee called the deliberate sinking of a South Korean warship.

SEOUL, South Korea — Tensions escalated sharply Monday on the Korean peninsula, as South Korean President Lee Myung-bak said that his nation would cut nearly all trade withNorth Korea, deny North Korean merchant ships use of South Korean sea lanes and ask theUnited Nations Security Councilto punish the North for what he called the deliberate sinking of a South Korean warship two months ago. The steps outlined by Mr. Lee in a nationally televised speech — coupled with new moves bySouth Korea’s military to resume “psychological warfare” propaganda broadcasts at the border after a six-year suspension — amounted to the most serious action the South could take short of an armed retaliation for the sinking of the ship, the South’s worst military loss since the Korean War ended in a truce in 1953. “We have always tolerated North Korea’s brutality, time and again,” Mr. Lee said. “But now things are different. North Korea will pay a price corresponding to its provocative acts. Trade and exchanges between South and North Korea will be suspended.” North Korea’s military immediately warned that if South Korea put up propaganda loudspeakers and slogans at the border, it would destroy them with artillery shells, reported the North’s official K.C.N.A. news agency.Mr. Lee’s speech came as Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was visiting Beijing and pressing China to take a much tougher position toward North Korea, China’s historical ally. The speech was bound to intensify pressure on the Chinese, who have called for restraint. North Korea has denied responsibility for the sinking of the South Korean warship, theCheonan, on March 26, which left 46 sailors dead. A growing body of evidence has suggested a North Korean torpedo sank the ship. Cutting off trade with North Korea is the most punishing unilateral action the South could take against the impoverished North. South Korea imports $230 million worth of seafood and other products from the North a year. North Korea earns $50 million a year making clothes and carrying out other business deals with South Korean companies. Mr. Lee also said that South Korea would block North Korean merchant ships from using South Korean waters, which would force the ships to detour and use more fuel. Besides these unilateral measures, South Korea will “refer this matter to the U.N. Security Council, so that the international community can join us in holding the North accountable,” Mr. Lee said. “Many countries around the world have expressed their full support for our position.” In a separate announcement, the Defense Ministry announced the resumption of propaganda blitzes aimed at the North, a cold war tactic with loudspeaker broadcasts along the border, propaganda radio broadcasts and leaflets dropped by balloon. The resumption was bound to irritate the North Korea leader, Kim Jong-il, whose grip on power rests partly on denying outside information to citizens. North Korea has already warned that such a move would prompt it to shut down the border with the South completely, raising the possibility of stranding 1,000 South Korean workers at a joint industrial park in the North Korean town of Kaesong. President Lee cited evidence that a multinational team of investigators released last week on the sinking of the ship, saying “no responsible country in the international community will be able to deny the fact that the Cheonan was sunk by North Korea.” But he stopped short of mentioning China by name. Mr. Lee also stopped short of terminating the Kaesong industrial complex. Delivering his speech from the Korean War Memorial in Seoul, Mr. Lee drew an analogy between the North’s surprise invasion that started the three-year Korean War on June 25, 1950, and the blast that sank the Cheonan. “Again, the perpetrator was North Korea. Their attack came at a time when the people of the Republic of Korea were enjoying their well-earned rest after a hard day’s work,” he said. “Once again, North Korea violently shattered our peace.”

The finding on the attack — one of the worst military provocations since the end of the Korean War — is sure to deepen tensions between the two Koreas.

SEOUL, South Korea —South Koreahas concluded that a North Korean torpedo sank one of its warships in March, killing 46 sailors, according to government officials and domestic news reports on Tuesday. South Korean officials are preparing to announce the results of their investigation later this week. The much anticipated finding will accuseNorth Koreaof committing one of the worst military provocations on the Korean Peninsula since the end of the Korean War, deepening tensions between the countries. North Korea, denying involvement in the sinking, has vowed to retaliate against any attempt to link it with the March 26 explosion that broke the South Korean corvette in half near a disputed sea border. But the South has pledged “resolute measures,” including economic sanctions, once the investigation is complete. “We will blame a torpedo attack and link it to North Korea,” said a government official briefed on the investigation, adding that the authorities were still fine-tuning an official announcement to be made on Thursday. He refused to discussforensicevidence that will be cited in the report. In a series of closed-door briefings scheduled for Wednesday, the Foreign Ministry intends to present to Chinese, Russian, Japanese and European diplomats “scientific and objective evidence to back up the conclusion that it was a North Korean torpedo attack,” said the South Korean news agency Yonhap. The finding is hardly a surprise. In recent weeks, South Korea’s defense minister has said that atorpedo attack was the likely causeof the sinking and thatresidue of an explosive used in torpedoeshad been found in the ship’s hull. But South Korea has carefully marshaled its evidence in a multinational investigation into the sinking to try to ensure that it can rally international support for economic and diplomatic sanctions against the North. Investigators established what they said was a critical forensic link when they matched metal pieces and traces of explosive recovered from the ship and the site where it sank with a stray North Korean torpedo secured by the South seven years ago, Yonhap and other South Korean news outlets reported. They also said they had found a fragment believed to be part of a North Korean torpedo’s propeller. They also found a serial number on fragments of a torpedo propeller that further strengthened the belief among South Korean, United States, Australian and other experts in the investigation that it was a North Korean attack, the newspaper Chosun Ilbo said Wednesday, citing an unnamed government source. The investigators have  been scrutinizing intercepted North Korean military communications to try to link the attack to a North Korean submarine, officials here said. South Korean officials said that if they proved that the ship had been attacked by a torpedo, people would naturally believe that the attacker was the North, with its long history of military and terrorist provocations against the South. But it remains unclear whether the forensic evidence the South has so far accumulated will be convincing enough to force China, a veto-wielding member of the United Nations Security Council and a North Korea ally, to support a statement or resolution denouncing the North. President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea needs Chinese support. His plan to punish the North would further weaken his country’s already diminished diplomatic leverage over the North Koreans, because it would deepen the North’s economic dependence on China at the expense of inter-Korean trade, analysts said. Meanwhile, opposition candidates in local and provincial elections on June 2 accused Mr. Lee of whipping up anti-North Korean sentiments to win conservative votes for his party’s candidates. “The government is unable to present any factual evidence that the ship was broken in half by a torpedo,” Yoo Si-min, an opposition candidate, said in a radio interview. “If they make their announcement without such evidence, they will make South Korea an international laughingstock.” Mr. Lee planned to make a speech next week to follow up on the announcement on Thursday by the Defense Ministry. In recent weeks, he and other senior officials have dropped  hints that the North was to blame, although they have not formally accused it. South Korean officials have suspended financing for government-level exchanges with North Korea and have asked South Korean companies not to start any new deals with the North. Mr. Lee talked with President Obama on Tuesday. The White House later said that the two leaders were “committed to follow the facts of the investigation wherever they lead.” The finding of a torpedo attack would almost certainly darken the prospects for inter-Korean relations, which have deteriorated badly since Mr. Lee’s inauguration in 2008.

SEOUL,South Korea— The South Korean and American militaries on Thursday raised their level of alert onNorth Korea, a day after the Communist North threatened a military clash. The militaries, which include 25,000 United States troops  based in South Korea, raised the alert from Level 3 to Level 2, the Defense Ministry of South Korea said. The shift involves a significant increase in reconnaissance flights and spy satellite activities, as well as  more vigorous gathering and analysis of electronic data from the North for signs of possible provocations, ministry officials said. Level 2 is the second highest level of vigilance and it is invoked when military officials fear  “a grave threat” from the North, the defense officials said. On Wednesday  North Korea escalated its vitriol  against South Korea and the United States,  warning of a “powerful military strike” if any North Korean ships were stopped or searched as part of an American-led operation to intercept vessels suspected of carrying unconventional weapons. South Korea agreed to join the operation after North Korea tested a nuclear device on Monday, its second nuclear test in three years. The North had earlier warned the South not to participate in the operation, known as theProliferation Security Initiative. “We consider this a declaration of war against us,” North Korea said in a statement carried by its official news agency, KCNA. “Any hostile act against our peaceful vessels, including search and seizure, will be considered an unpardonable infringement on our sovereignty, and we will immediately respond with a powerful military strike.” The North Koreans also said in the statement that they “no longer feel bound by the armistice” that ended the fighting in the 1950-53 Korean War. Technically, the two Koreas have remained at war for more than 50 years, because the 1953 armistice was never replaced with a final peace treaty. The North Koreans had previously called the armistice a “useless piece of paper” and declared that they no longer felt bound by it. But they have rarely used the threat of abandoning the armistice. At the United Nations, the United States and Japan were drawing up a rough draft of a Security Council resolution that would concentrate on five or six ways to flesh out existing sanctions against North Korea that had never been enforced, diplomats said. Although China supports the idea of sanctions, it wants to work slowly and to bolster measures first passed in 2006 rather than creating new ones, they said. The proposals include banning imports and exports of all arms — only heavy weapons are restricted now. “We want to dry out their resources for the military,” said a senior Western diplomat, speaking anonymously because of the sensitivity of the negotiations. North Korea has said that it will consider sanctions a declaration of war. “If North Korea stages a provocation, we will respond resolutely,” the South Korean military said in a statement, reacting to the North’s threats. Citing a “strong” military alliance with the United States, it said, “We advise our people to trust our military’s solid readiness and feel safe.” Since inter-Korean relations began deteriorating a year ago, analysts at government-run and private policy institutes in South Korea have often warned of a possible naval skirmish. The analysts said North Korea might engage in a limited armed provocation along the border, especially along the disputed western sea border. South Korea’s president, Lee Myung-bak, lauded his people on Wednesday for their “mature response” to the North’s behavior. He noted that the North’s nuclear test and its six subsequent short-range missile launchings did not affect stock and foreign exchange markets beyond initial jitters.

SEOUL,South Korea—North Koreaunilaterally declared on Friday that it was scrapping agreements it had signed with South Korea to ease military tension on the divided Korean Peninsula. The announcement followed a series of recent saber-rattling gestures from North Korea that officials and analysts in Seoul have said were aimed at raising tension to gain attention from the new administration of President Barack Obama and to win concessions from PresidentLee Myung-bakof South Korea. “All the agreed points concerning the issue of putting an end to the political and military confrontation between the North and the South will be nullified,” said a statement from the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea, the North Korean agency in charge of relations with South Korea. It said the accords to be nullified included a 1991 agreement on reconciliation and non-aggression, as well as North Korea’s promise, contained in the agreement’s appendix, that it would honor the western sea border claimed by South Korea. North Korea has flouted these agreements by developing nuclear weapons and sparking naval clashes on the disputed sea border in 1999 and 2002. After the 1999 clash, it unilaterally redrew the sea border. Government analysts in Seoul scrambled on Friday to figure out the North’s intentions. For one thing, they said, it remained unclear whether the North was also nullifying the agreements its supreme leader, Kim Jong-il, signed with President Lee’s two predecessors in 2000 and 2007 during rare inter-Korean summits. Those two agreements have been the basis of a decadelong softening of relations on the peninsula. During the "sunshine" period, billions of dollars of trade and economic aid  —  as well as millions of South Koreans on tour or for family reunions  —  crossed the heavily armed border. North Korea has even called the oldest and primary agreement for peace — the 1953 armistice that ended the three-year Korean War — a “useless piece of paper.” Won Tae Jae, a spokesman of the Defense Ministry in Seoul, said Friday in a news briefing that the South would respond “resolutely” if North violated its western sea border again. “We will see more tension in western waters,” said Lee Byong-chul, senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation, a nonpartisan policy advisory body based in Seoul. “It doesn’t appear that it will just end up as empty words from the North.” He predicted that North Korea would focus on improving ties with the Obama administration while snubbing President Lee. Driving a wedge between the allies has been a favorite tactic in North Korean diplomacy. The North Korean committee said it was scrapping the agreements because Mr. Lee had violated them first with his “reckless confrontational rackets against our republic.” “Relations between the North and South have worsened to the point where there is no way or hope of correcting them,” the committee’s statement said. “They have reached the extreme point where the clash of fire against fire, steel against steel, has become inevitable.” North Korea’s oratorical attacks on the South have increased in intensity since Mr. Lee took office a year ago with a vow to take a tougher stance on North Korea, reversing 10 years of his liberal predecessors’ efforts to engage the North with substantial economic aid. Two weeks ago, the North Korean military declared an “all-out confrontational posture” with the South. North Korean officials also told a visiting American scholar that the country had “weaponized” enough plutonium for four or five atomic bombs. Verbal threats from North Korea, which has at various points vowed to turn South Korea into a “sea of fire” and a “heap of ashes,” are a recurring feature of postwar relations between the two countries. They seldom raise an alarm among South Koreans. Since the 1970s, the two Koreas have signed a series of agreements for non-aggression and cooperation, which the North has flouted repeatedly, rendering them little more than symbolic. Still, this was the first time North Korea has said that it was officially nullifying them. “We hope the North will realize that spawning and raising tensions between South and North Korea is not appropriate for peace not only on the Korean peninsula but also in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world,” said Kim Ho-nyeon,the South Korean government’s main spokesman in inter-Korean relations. Mr. Kim said the government was dealing with the North Korean blustering “with calm.” But some analysts said that the chances of North Korea launching a limited border skirmish to prove its points were rising. Still, the South Korean military heightened security along the border in the recent weeks. So far, it has reported no unusual movement by the North Korean army.

SEOUL,South Korea— South Korea placed more soldiers at frontier guard posts and told its fishermen to refrain from sailing near North Korean waters on Sunday, a day after the North Korean military declared an “all-out confrontational posture” against the South and threatened a naval clash. The North Korean threat on Saturday came in the same day when an American scholar said North Korean officials told him that they had “weaponized” enough plutonium for roughly four or five nuclear bombs. Also Saturday,North Korea’s Foreign Ministry said the country would maintain its “status as a nuclear weapons state” as long as it perceived a nuclear threat from the United States.American intelligence officials have previously estimated that the North had harvested enough fuel for six or more bombs, although it has never been clear whether the North constructed the weapons. The scholar, Selig S. Harrison, said the officials had not defined what “weaponized” meant, but the implication was that they had built nuclear arms. The North conducted a test of a nuclear device in 2006, but it appeared to result in a fizzle and experts concluded the explosion was relatively small. While the country has often claimed to possess a “deterrent,” this appears to be the first time it has quantified how much plutonium it says it has turned into weapons. After the threats on Saturday, South Korea ordered its military to heighten vigilance along the heavily fortified border with North Korea, according to a spokesman for the South Korean military joint chiefs of staff. North Korea’s saber-rattling toward the South has increased in intensity since President Lee Myung-bak took office in Seoul a year ago with a vow to take a tougher stance on North Korea, reversing 10 years of his liberal predecessors’ efforts to engage the North with economic aid. But what made the threat on Saturday unusual, and more worrisome to some South Korean analysts, was the way it was delivered: in a statement read on North Korean television by a uniformed spokesman for the North’s joint chiefs of staff. “Strong military measures will follow from our revolutionary armed force,” the spokesman, a colonel, said, according to Yonhap, South Korea’s national news agency, which monitors North Korean broadcasts. Usually the North Korean government issues written statements that are delivered by the state-controlled media; sometimes the statements are read by press officers, not by a uniformed member of the military. The spokesman warned of a clash along a disputed western sea border between the Koreas. Their navies fought skirmishes there in 1999 and 2002. On Sunday, North Korea’s state-run television and radio were repeatedly broadcasting the statement. They also reported that North Korean workers were whole-heatedly supporting their government, “swelling with hostility” toward Mr. Lee. After the threats on Saturday, South Korea ordered its military to heighten vigilance along the heavily fortified border with North Korea. Officers along the border were ordered to be on standby at their posts, according to a spokesman of the South Korean military joint chiefs of staff. “We are sending in more soldiers on guard post duty along the border,” he said on Sunday. “But so far, we haven’t seen any unusual movement from the North Korean military, and our measures do not include redeploying rear-area troops to the border.” Lee Yong Sun, a fisherman in Baengnyeong, a South Korean island near the western maritime border, said Sunday that the marines there told all fishermen not to sail near the disputed border. It is always difficult to decipher the messages that North Korea’s government is trying to send with its often bombastic statements. In times of crucial bargaining, North Korea often tries to drive a wedge between Washington and South Korea and raises the stakes by increasing demands and issuing threats. With President-elect Barack Obama about to take office and negotiations over the North’s nuclear program expected to resume, it is possible that the North is merely setting up its negotiating position. But analysts said the North’s remarks could also be an indication that it was intending to hold onto its arms despite an agreement it signed with five countries including the United States in 2005, in which it committed to eventually giving up any nuclear weapons. The exact conditions under which it would do so were left vague. Questions over the health of the country’s leader, Kim Jong-il, also complicate any attempts to understand North Korea’s aims. In August, there were reports that Mr. Kim suffered a stroke, and since then rumors have swirled about whether he is still making important decisions. Mr. Harrison, the scholar, presented North Korea’s claims of weaponization on Saturday in Beijing after returning from North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang. Mr. Harrison, a former journalist who is the director of the Asia program at the Center for International Policy, has traveled several times to North Korea to meet with senior officials there. “They’ve raised the bar and said, ‘We are a nuclear weapons state, and deal with us on that basis,’ “ Mr. Harrison said at a news conference in the St. Regis Hotel. Mr. Harrison acknowledged that North Korea could be bluffing to use the claim of having nuclear weapons as a negotiating tactic. North Korea had declared to the United States last year that it possessed 37 kilograms of plutonium; officials told Mr. Harrison on his trip that they had weaponized almost 31 kilograms. Despite that news, he said all the officials he met with seemed eager to open discussions with the incoming Obama administration. “All the statements about Obama were very helpful, very respectful,” he said. Mr. Harrison said the North Korean officials had several proposals for Mr. Obama, including allowing North Korea to have access to long-term, low-interest credit to buy food. South Korea had no immediate reaction to Mr. Harrison’s report. Earlier Saturday, North Korea had appeared to toughen its stance toward Washington, saying that reopening diplomatic ties would not be enough to persuade it to give up its nuclear weapons. It said it would maintain its “status as a nuclear weapons state” as long as there was a nuclear threat from the United States. “We can live without normalizing ties with the United States, but we cannot live without a nuclear deterrent,” a spokesman for North Korea’s Foreign Ministry told its official news agency, KCNA. In the past, the North had said it would not dismantle any weapons until the United States changed what it termed its “hostile attitude.” In the spokesman’s comments, and his similar statement last Tuesday, North Korea laid out its demands as it prepared for a new series of negotiations with  Mr. Obama, who will be inaugurated on Tuesday. In its Tuesday statement, North Korea indicated that the removal of an American nuclear threat meant the removal of South Korea from the American nuclear umbrella, the introduction of a verification mechanism to ensure that no American atomic weapons are deployed in or pass through South Korea, and even simultaneous nuclear disarmament talks among “all nuclear states,” including itself. Six-nation talks on ending North Korea’s nuclear programs, which include the United States, stalled in the last months of the Bush administration as the United States and North Korea bickered over how much nuclear inspection the North should accept.

SEOUL,South Korea— A North Korean military officer defected to South Korea across its heavily armed border, the first Communist officer to do so in a decade, a South Korean military spokesman said on Monday. The soldier crossed the western sector of the 2.5-mile wide Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas at around 4:50 p.m. Sunday, said the spokesman at the South Korean Defense Ministry who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the matter. “We are investigating the motive of his defection,” he said. The Yonhap news agency identified the soldier as a 28-year-old second lieutenant, and gave his family name as Ri. But the South Korean military spokesman declined to reveal the defector’s name and rank and other information such as whether he was armed when he crossed the border. Although more than 10,000 North Koreans have fled to the South through China in the past decade, few have dared cross the border btween the two Koreas, which is guarded by barbed wired fences, mine fields and nearly two million troops on both sides.

Leaders of North and South Korea on Wednesday discussed turning their disputed western sea border into a “peace and cooperation zone” for fishing and manufacturing.

SEOUL,South Korea, Nov. 14 — In the first meeting of their prime ministers in 15 years, North and South Korea on Wednesday discussed turning their disputed western sea border, the site of naval skirmishes as recently as five years ago, into a “peace and cooperation zone” for fishing and manufacturing. The initiative, proposed by South Korea, was at the top of the agenda as the North Korean prime minister, Kim Yong-il, and his South Korean counterpart, Han Duck-soo, began three days of talks in Seoul, hoping to extend the spirit of reconciliation fostered by a summit meeting in October andNorth Korea’s recent move to disable its nuclear weapons facilities. Mr. Kim, a transportation expert, was promoted to prime minister in April, with a directive from the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, to revive North Korea’s moribund economy. Last month, Prime Minister Kim visited Vietnam, which has normalized ties with the United States and has begun rebuilding its economy with foreign investment. South Korean hopes that North Korea will follow Vietnam’s course soared in mid-October when Kim Jong-il reportedly told the visiting Vietnamese leader, Nong Duc Manh, the Communist Party secretary general, that he wanted to emulate Vietnam’s policy of economic change. North Korea  “is eager to see the Oct. 4 declaration implemented at an early date,” Prime Minister Kim said Wednesday, referring to a broadly worded agreement between Kim Jong-il and President  Roh Moo-hyun of South Korea. The meeting on Wednesday was intended to follow up on the agreement. At the summit meeting, the two leaders agreed to a number of joint economic projects. South Korea hopes to improve roads and railways in North Korea and build special economic zones so it can relocate some of its labor-intensive industries there. Among other proposals, Mr. Han suggested an inter-Korean committee to build the “peace and cooperation zone.” That plan calls for creating a joint fishing zone along the disputed sea border, opening Haeju, a major naval base on North Korea’s southwestern tip, for commercial ships from the South and building an industrial park there. North Korean warships based at Haeju engaged in skirmishes with South Korean gunboats in 1999 and 2002. Persuading the two navies to pull back and turn the area into an economic zone would greatly  ease tensions on the divided peninsula, which remains technically at war since the Korean War ended in 1953 with a truce, not a peace treaty. It is unclear whether North Korea’s military  will try to block the latest initiative, as it has stymied previous reconciliation attempts, including a South Korean proposal to run trains across the border. The defense ministers of the two Koreas plan to meet this month in  North Korea. The prime ministers also discussed proposals for building joint shipyards in North Korea and improving communications, transportation and other services for South Koreans working at a joint industrial zone in Kaesong, a North Korean border town near Haeju, where about 20,000 North Koreans already are producing clothes, kitchen utensils and watches in factories run by South Koreans.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) —North Koreavowed Saturday to respond with “powerful nuclear deterrence” to joint American and South Korean military exercises poised to begin this weekend, saying the drills amounted to a provocation that would prompt “retaliatory sacred war.” North Korea routinely threatens war whenSouth Koreaand the United States hold joint military drills, which the North sees as a rehearsal for an attack on it. The latest threat comes amid increased tensions on the divided Korea Peninsula over the sinking of a South Korean warship that South Korea and the United States say was the result of a North Korean attack. Forty-six South Korean sailors were killed when the ship sank in March. South Korea and the United States announced last week that they would stage the drills as a message to North Korea to stop its “aggressive” behavior. North Korea denies any role in the sinking and says any punishment will start a war.

President Lee Myung-bak suffered a setback in elections that had been widely viewed as a referendum on his handling of the sinking of a South Korean warship.

SEOUL, South Korea — PresidentLee Myung-bak’s party has suffered a surprising setback in local elections that were widely seen as a referendum on his handling ofNorth Korea’s alleged torpedoing of a South Korean warship. Results from the elections were released on Thursday, and the voter turnout of 54.5 percent was the highest for local elections in 15 years. Candidates of Mr. Lee’s governing Grand National Party had hoped that outrage inSouth Koreaover the sinking of theCheonan, which killed 46 South Korean sailors, would help them ride a conservative wave to  victory. Mr. Lee’s government has formally accused North Korea of attacking the ship on March 26 with a torpedo from a submarine, a charge that the North has denied. “The election results were far less than we had expected and hoped for,” Cho Hae-jin, a spokesman for the governing party, said. The party’s chairman, Chung Mong-joon, an important ally of Mr. Lee, said he was stepping down over the poor results. Mr. Lee’s chief of staff, Chung Chung-kil, also offered to resign. Pre-election surveys showed that a majority of South Koreans blamed North Korea for the warship incident, which the government characterized as the worst North Korean military provocation since the end of the Korean War. Those surveys and political analysts had predicted that the president’s party would win at least 9 of 16 crucial races to elect big-city mayors and provincial governors in the voting on Wednesday. But the party won only six of the elections. Its main rival, the Democratic Party, won seven. The remaining three races were won by two independents and a candidate from a small opposition party. The results were a blow to Mr. Lee’s efforts to rally popular support for his campaign to punish North Korea. He also wanted a fresh mandate to push through his controversial $19 billion project to dredge and dam the country’s four main rivers. The mayor of Seoul, Oh Se-hoon, a member of Mr. Lee’s party, barely won re-election. But in a hotly contested mayoral race in Incheon, a large port city west of Seoul, the opposition candidate, Song Young-gil, a strong critic of Mr. Lee, won an unexpected victory. The ship’s sinking was an especially significant election issue there, because the ship went down within Incheon’s jurisdiction. Both of the  central Chungcheong provinces also rejected governing-party candidates. They were unhappy that Mr. Lee canceled the previous government’s plan to relocate several central government agencies to a new town to be built in the region. Nationwide, about 9,900 candidates campaigned for 3,991 posts, including contests for mayor in small cities, as well as members of city councils and education chiefs. In most of those smaller races, too, the opposition prevailed. Local elections in South Korea are often seen as a midterm referendum on the president. Political analysts said that even before the Cheonan sinking, as the nation’s economy recovered relatively quickly from the global recession, Mr. Lee’s approval ratings hovered around 50 percent and his party appeared to have a decent chance to win. But when the Cheonan sank, Mr. Lee’s party  turned it into a dominating campaign theme to tamp down the domestic disputes, such as the  river dredging  project. Its candidates lambasted opposition rivals who championed engagement with North Korea. Opposition politicians contended that Mr. Lee’s hard-line approach to North Koreahad helped provoke the North to lash out. “Yes, people agreed with the president that the North needed punishing,” said Jeong Chan-soo, a senior analyst at the political consultancy MIN Consulting. “But when the government announced its investigative results on the same day when the election campaign began, and when President Lee chose the Korean War Museum as the venue to deliver his speech to criticize North Korea, they thought he was overreacting. “They felt a risk of war,” Mr. Jeong added. “They thought they needed to rein in their president.” “This is the people’s verdict on Lee Myung-bak’s arrogance,” said Woo Sang-ho, a spokesman for the Democratic Party. Chung Se-kyun, the leader of the Democratic Party, said the results indicated that Mr. Lee should “abandon his confrontational policy on North Korea and ease tensions on the Korean peninsula.” Security concerns about North Korea had influenced previous elections in the South, almost always helping conservative candidates in a phenomenon known as “the North Wind.” Panicked opposition candidates accused Mr. Lee of exploiting the sinking to raise tensions for political gains. And North Korea joined the fray, urging South Koreans to “deal sledgehammer blows” against Mr. Lee.

Cutting the hot line, installed after earlier skirmishes, raises the chances of an armed clash in tense waters. 
==::==
2010-05-28T00:00:00Z
==::==
SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreasaid Thursday that it was cutting off a naval hot line that was intended to prevent clashes near its disputed sea border withSouth Korea. Meanwhile, the South conducted a large naval drill in a show of force. Cutting the link, established in 2004 after deadly skirmishes in 1999 and 2002, raises the chances of an armed clash in the tense waters off the western coast of the Korean Peninsula — something the North has said could happen any time, particularly now that the South has officially accused it of sinking one of its warships in March. “We will immediately deliver a physical strike at anyone intruding across our maritime demarcation line,” the North’s state-run news agency KCNA quoted a senior military official as saying, referring to the North’s self-proclaimed sea border, which juts deeply into South Korean waters. The two sides have disagreed on the line for a western sea border since the Korean War ended with a truce in 1953. The North’s warnings on Thursday came as a fleet of 10 South Korean warships, including a 3,500-ton destroyer, conducted an exercise far south of the disputed waters. Shells pounded the sea and columns of water erupted as antisubmarine depth charges exploded during the one-day exercise. In Japan, a legislative committee forwarded to Parliament a bill that would allow coast guard vessels to inspect North Korean freighters in international waters. The measure is expected to pass. The Japanese government is also considering ways to cut down on remittances and other shipments from members of its large North Korean community to their native country. Following up on the North’s earlier threat to cut all remaining ties with South Korea, the North Korean military also said Thursday that it was considering blocking communications and transportation across the land border. Currently, hundreds of South Korean factory managers and engineers travel daily to and from the joint industrial park at Kaesong, a North Korean border town. Blocking the border would cut off the complex, where 120 South Korean factories employ 45,000 North Korean workers. So far, despite the escalating tensions, neither side has shut the complex, the last remnant of the so-called sunshine policy pursued under President Lee Myung-bak’s most recent predecessors, Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun. This week, the South suspended most trade with the North, which has denied involvement in the ship’s sinking. Earlier, the North had threatened to “completely block South Korean personnel and vehicles” from Kaesong if the South carried out its plan to resume its psychological warfare against the North, mainly through propaganda broadcasts across the border. The North’s military said Thursday that it would  destroy the South’s  loudspeakers.

As President Obama began a weeklong visit to Asia, the North said South Korea would “pay dearly” for its role in the skirmish.

SEOUL,South Korea—North Koreathreatened Friday to take “merciless military measures” along a disputed maritime border with South Korea, escalating tensions as President Obama began a weeklong visit to Asia. The two Korean naviesclashed on Tuesdayin their first violent skirmish in seven years, and since then the North has issued harsh daily statements demanding a South Korean apology and warning that the South will“pay dearly”for the naval clash. The two Koreas have accused each other of violating territorial waters and firing the first shot in the skirmish, which left a North Korean ship badly damaged. On Friday, a statement from the North Korean military said the South Korean vessels had attacked its patrol boat with thousands of rounds of ammunition. South Korea, which had initially said it fired 200 to 250 rounds, later said that it had fired thousands of shots. The South said one of its patrol boats was also lightly damaged when the North Korean vessel fired 50 rounds. The clash erupted in the western coastal waters controlled by South Korea under a demarcation line drawn by the United Nations at the end of hostilities in the 1950-53 Korean War. North Korea reiterated its claim to a border line that is farther south than the current one, known as theNorthern Limit Line.“From this moment, we will take merciless military measures to defend” the line, the North said, without elaborating. North Korea has previously used periods of heightened tensions to increase its negotiating leverage. The skirmish came as South Korean news media reported that South Korean envoys were secretly meeting North Korean officials to arrange a meeting between President Lee Myung-bak and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il. Mr. Lee’s office has denied these reports. Mr. Obama, who arrived in Tokyo on Friday afternoon, is due in Seoul on Wednesday. Earlier this week, he agreed to sendStephen W. Bosworth, his special envoy on North Korea policy, to the North for talks on ending itsnuclear weaponsprogram. North Korea wants nuclear disarmament talks to include negotiations for a peace treaty to formally end the war, replacing a truce signed in 1953. North Korea says the lack of a mutually acceptable maritime border and the naval skirmishes prove the need for a peace treaty. The two navies also clashed in 1999 and 2002. North Korea accused the United States of initiating the 2002 clash to disrupt Korean reconciliation. This time, the North called South Korea’s military “warmongers” and accused it of trying to sabotage talks between Washington and North Korea.

The U.S. defense secretary said he saw no unusual moves by North Korea, which reportedly fired another missile.

SINGAPORE — Defense SecretaryRobert M. Gatessaid Friday that the United States had detected no unusual military movement inNorth Koreaand had no plans to reinforce some 28,000 American forces inSouth Koreaafter the Norththreatened its neighborwith a military attack. A South Korean Defense Ministry  official said later that North Korea had test-fired a short-range missile from its northeast coast on Friday. The official declined to be identified because of the delicacy of the issue. Since it tested a nuclear device last Monday, triggering an international crisis, North Korea has test-fired at least six missiles. Mr. Gates made his comments before the latest missile launching, but military officials traveling with him indicated it would be unlikely to change his assessment. By military movements, Mr. Gates appeared to be referring to troop movements or other signs that the North was preparing for an impending military conflict. In a continuing sign of nervousness in the region, Chinese fishing boats were seen pulling out of ports in the North and heading elsewhere, according to South Korean and other news reports. From Yeonpyeong, the South Korean island closest to the North, about a dozen Chinese ships were seen moving away, The Associated Press reported, quoting South Korea’s Yonhap news agency, which also said that the number of Chinese vessels fishing in the area had fallen from more than 280 earlier this week to about 140. In Seoul, the Yonhap news agency said North Korea had test-fired a new surface-to-air missile with a range of about 160 miles.  The Defense Ministry official said the missile was launched from a site in Musudan-ri on the northeastern coast, the same area from which a long-range rocket waslaunched on April 5in what was seen as a test of North Korea’s intercontinental ballistic missile technology. The launching on Friday came as hundreds of thousands of South Koreans attended an emotional state funeral in Seoul for their former president, Roh Moo-hyun. Mr. Roh committed suicide a week ago in the midst of a corruption scandal. Maintaining its strident rhetoric, North Korea said Friday it would respond to action against it by the United Nations Security Council, which is discussing tough measures against Pyongyang. “If the U.N. Security Council makes a further provocation, it will be inevitable for us to take further self-defense measures,” the North’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency. Speaking to reporters on his plane en route to Singapore for an annual security conference that will be dominated by North Korea’s nuclear test, Mr. Gates said he would use the  gathering  to reassure America’s strongest allies in northeast Asia, Japan and South Korea, of President Obama’s commitment to their defense in the face of the latest of a half-century of threats from North Korea. “I’m not aware of any military moves in the North that are out of the ordinary,” Mr. Gates said. The defense secretary said that he saw no need to bolster American troops in South Korea, and that “should the North Koreans do something rash and extremely provocative militarily,” the United States “has the forces to deal with it.” The North tested a nuclear device and launched three missiles in defiance of international sanctions on Monday, fired more missiles on Tuesday and threatened military strikes against South Korea on Wednesday. By Thursday, the South Korean and American militaries had raised their alert level on North Korea to the second highest, invoked when “a grave threat” is feared from the North. But Mr. Gates said the Obama administration considered the test aggressive but not a crisis. Nonetheless, he echoed other senior officials by saying that North Korea’s export of its nuclear technology to other countries was a major concern. “These guys have shown a penchant in the past for selling anything they’ve been able to develop,” Mr. Gates said. North Korea’s military threats on Wednesday against the South, which were more belligerent than usual, were in response to South Korea’s decision to join an American-led operation to stop and search ships carrying suspicious cargo. The operation, called the Proliferation Security Initiative, was created by former President George W. Bush in 2003 and now includes 95 countries. North Korea reacted by calling South Korea’s action a “declaration of war.” North Korea’s nuclear test on Monday, an underground blast in the mountains of Kilju near the Chinese border, was the country’s second. So far, American officials believe it to be more of a successful explosion than North Korea’s first nuclear test, conducted in 2006 in the same spot and later judged only partially successful. In Singapore, Mr. Gates is attending the annualShangri-La Dialogue, a regional defense conference organized by the International Institute for Strategic Studies and named for the luxury hotel in which it is held. While there, Mr. Gates is to meet with the highest-ranking defense official sent by China, the deputy chief of staff of the general staff for the People’s Liberation Army, Lt. Gen. Ma Xiaotian, and is likely to push China to follow up strong condemnations of North Korea’s test with action. Mr. Gates said that China, which has considerable influence on North Korea, could help by strongly supporting strengthened sanctions against North Korea that the United States was now pushing in the United Nations Security Council. The sanctions could include banning imports and exports of all arms — only heavy weapons are restricted now — and cutting off North Korea’s access to international banks. In Singapore, Mr. Gates will also meet with the defense ministers of Japan and South Korea. He is to be joined by James Steinberg, the deputy secretary of state, and Dennis Blair, the director of national intelligence. Mr. Gates also told reporters that six-party talks between the United States, North Korea and other countries in the region had not worked so far. “They clearly have not had the impact in North Korea that any of us have wanted,” Mr. Gates said. “That doesn’t mean they’re useless, by any means, and we are still committed to the six-party talks.”

After years of hope that relations with the North would thaw if the South tried to coax it into engagement, regional experts and others speak of growing disenchantment.

PAJU,South Korea— Peering atNorth Koreain the hazy distance from the demilitarized zone, standing under an upbeat mural trumpeting improved relations between the separated countries, a visitor from South Korea struck a skeptical note. “We sent them food, fertilizer, factories, more than we give our own poor people,” said the South Korean, Lee Soon-hwan, a 30-year-old office worker. “And all they pay us back with is this nuclear test.” After years of hope that relations with the North would thaw if the South tried to coax it into engagement, regional experts and others speak of growing disenchantment. Many South Koreans reacted with exasperation and even anger to North Korea’s nuclear test on Monday, uncharacteristically harsh responses in a country that has long been more tolerant of its unruly northern neighbor than have its allies in Washington and Tokyo. Partly, the reaction reflects the outrage here at the timing of the test, coming as South Korea was in mourning over the suicide of a former president on Saturday. But there are also signs of fatigue with a recalcitrant North that has responded to the South’s largess by continuing to build up its nuclear arsenal. “There has been a paradigm shift in how South Koreans view North Korea,” said Jeung Young-tai, a North Korea expert at the Korea Institute for National Unification. “The nuclear test has made people feel that North Korea has gone too far, and it’s high time for us to be tough on North Korea.” The engagement policy followed years of enforced separation and relentless anti-North propaganda that ignored South Korea’s deep emotional bonds with the other half of the peninsula, forced apart, as they see it, by big-power politics during the cold war. The so-calledsunshine policybegan in the late 1990s and was broadly popular, even surviving the first North Korean nuclear test in 2006. But Mr. Jeung said that people now felt no safer after 10 years of engagement and that the latest nuclear test, along with the North’s test-firing of a long-range rocket last month, had driven home to many in South Korea their need to build up their own military, and stick with their traditional ally, the United States. Such a shift may bring South Korea closer in many ways to Washington. A sign came Tuesday, when President Lee Myung-bak announced that South Korea would belatedly join the Proliferation Security Initiative, an American-led program to intercept ships suspected of carrying unconventional weapons. The South had refrained from joining for fear of angering the North. At the same time, fundamental differences with the United States remain. While Washington has in the past spoken of blockades and further isolating North Korea, few South Koreans are talking about cutting off aid and economic relations completely. Instead, the South Korean public appears ready to accept continued engagement, but with new demands that North Korea also show good faith, particularly by curtailing its weapons program. Still, even talk of imposing conditions on aid suggests a shift in attitudes for South Koreans, who have long viewed the North as a proud but poor cousin that should be tolerated and led toward eventually peaceful reunification. Such sentiments guided South Korean policy for a decade, as Seoul opened an industrial park and a mountain resort in the North, and extended it hundreds of millions of dollars in aid. Those ties began to sour after the election last year of Mr. Lee, a conservative who said aid should be offered only if the North ended its nuclear program. Weariness with the North has also grown over the past year, after the North responded to Mr. Lee’s tougher stance by temporarily closing access to the Kaesong industrial park, detaining a South Korean accused of slandering the North Korean government, and test-firing a long-range rocket in April. “South Koreans are feeling frustration and fatigue with the North Korea relationship,” said Daniel Pinkston, North East Asia deputy project director at International Crisis Group, an nonprofit organization that tries to prevent deadly conflicts. “They want more reciprocity.” While there have been no recent public opinion polls, the shift has begun emerging in online chat rooms and newspaper opinion articles, like one in JoongAng Ilbo on Wednesday entitled “Stop Being Suckers for Kim Jong-il.” The tougher attitudes were also apparent in more than a dozen recent street interviews with South Koreans at places like the Unification Observatory in Paju, an hour northwest of Seoul overlooking the demilitarized zone. Many of those interviewed said they were frustrated that North Korea seemed to be pushing their country around, although the South was the one opening its pocketbook. And while no one called for cutting off the North outright, most agreed that South Korea should get more benefits, and more respect, for its money. “I’m tired of the whole relationship,” said Kim Bong-jin, 52, who owns a machinery factory nearby. “The past administrations have supported North Korea too excessively, and the result isnuclear weapons.” His friend, Lim Jae-hyung, 52, a technician, said, “We have the money, we should be getting more from it.” From the observatory, the vastly different levels of wealth between the Koreas were plainly visible. In the North Korean town of Maegol, people could be seen walking along dirt roads between gray buildings with no vehicles in sight. By contrast, a busy six-lane highway cut through Paju, a popular tourist area with a go-kart track, a drive-in theater and rows of gaudy “love” hotels. While conservatives have always taken a hard line toward the North, many on the left who supported the sunshine policy also say they are fed up with the North Koreans. This was particularly evident among supporters of former President Roh Moo-hyun, who jumped to his death on Saturday. A suicide note suggested that he was despondent about a corruption investigation. Mr. Roh had pursued friendly engagement with the North, and many of those who mourned him at makeshift altars on Wednesday expressed anger at the North over the nuclear test, which they called an unforgivable show of callous disregard. “It is unbelievable that they would do this at such a sad and sensitive time,” said one mourner, Kang Han-seung.

As a joint U.S.-South Korea military exercise began, North Korea warned that it would attack the U.S., Japan and South Korea if they tried to shoot down its planned satellite launch.

SEOUL,South Korea— As thousands of American Marines poured into South Korea on Monday to kick off an annual joint military exercise that the United States described as routine,North Koreaissued a characteristically bellicose statement calling the maneuvers preparations to invade and warning that it would attack the United States, Japan and South Korea if there was any attempt to interfere with a coming launching. North Korea says it plans to send a satellite into orbit, but neighboring governments believe it will be testing itsTaepodong-2 missile, which theoretically can reach as far as Hawaii and Alaska. The North put its 1.1-million-member armed forces on standby and cut off a military hot line, the only remaining channel of direct communications between the Koreas, the South Korean government said. “Shooting our satellite for peaceful purposes will precisely mean a war,” the North Korean military said in a statement. It vowed “a just retaliatory strike operation, not only against all the interceptor means involved, but against the strongholds” of the United States, South Korea and Japan. South Korea’s Defense Ministry played down the threats as “political rhetoric.” But the North Korean statement reinforced fears that it might resort to military provocations to vent anger at South Korea, which has stopped sending the North free food, as well as to drag the United States into negotiating. North Korea’s missile and nuclear threats are the impoverished country’s main tool of extracting foreign aid. Decades ofindoctrinationhave led North Koreans to live under a constant fear of American invasion, and some experts said the leaderKim Jong-ilwas playing on that anxiety to strengthen his standing domestically. Questions have been raised about his grip on power since August, when, South Korean and American intelligence agencies believe, hesuffered a stroke. “The latest joint U.S.-South Korean military exercise gives the North Korean regime a chance to fan those fears anew and rally its hungry populace around leader Kim Jong-il,” said Yang Moo-jin, a senior analyst at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, South Korea. ATaepodong-1 launchingin 1998 helped Mr. Kim consolidate power four years after the death of his father, President Kim Il-sung. The military exercise, called Key Resolve, involves 26,000 American troops, half of them sent from outside the Korean peninsula, as well as an American aircraft carrier and an unspecified number of South Korean soldiers. The stated purpose  is to test of how fast the United States military can respond to a North Korean attack. “It is not tied in any way to any political or real-world event,” said Gen. Walter L. Sharp, head of the United States military in South Korea. The military hot line that the North cut off is used mainly to clear the border crossing for shipments of goods produced at the industrial complex in the North Korean city of Kaesong and for the 570 South Koreans working there. About 700 South Koreans who had planned to enter Kaesong on Monday, as well as 80 who had planned to return to Seoul on the same day, were not permitted to cross the border, according to the South Korean government. Also Monday, the new United States special envoy for North Korea, Stephen W. Bosworth, met with Foreign Minister Yu Myung-hwan and Defense Minister Lee Sang-hee of South Korea to discuss how to bring North Korea back to nuclear disarmament talks.

SEOUL,South Korea— The South Korean president-elect,Lee Myung-bak, who said during his campaign that he intended to get tough withNorth Korea, declared  Thursday that he would not hesitate to criticize its authoritarian government. Although North Korea’s Communist government made no public comment on Thursday about Mr. Lee’s election on Wednesday, North Korea was expected to react harshly. Aides to Mr. Lee acknowledged that there could be at least a temporary chill in the cross-border flow of trade and investment that the departing president, Roh Moo-hyun, had painstakingly nourished. “I assure you that there will be a change from the past government’s practice of avoiding criticism of North Korea and unilaterally flattering it,” Mr. Lee said at his first news conference as president-elect. “The North’s human rights issue is something we cannot avoid in this regard, and North Korea should know it.” Mr. Lee is to be sworn in on Feb. 25, ending a decade of liberal   South Korean policies that led to a lessening of tensions with North Korea, but often caused friction with the United States and Japan, especially over how to address the North’s nuclear arms program and its human rights abuses. Mr. Lee won the election on Wednesday with 48.7 percent of the vote, a shade less than the 48.9 percent Mr. Roh won five years ago riding on the sentiments of young, nationalistic and often anti-American voters. But Mr. Lee’s 22.6 percentage point margin of victory over his closest rival, Chung Dong-young, in a crowded race of 10 candidates, was the biggest in a half-century. Mr. Lee, a former Hyundai chief executive, won largely on the voters’ belief that he could help revive the economy. On Thursday, he pledged to end an “antimarket and antibusiness atmosphere.” The new approach in Seoul was expected to improve relations with the United States and Japan, which had sometimes been critical of Mr. Roh’s conciliatory “sunshine policy” toward North Korea. It also means that North Korea could lose what has been its most reliable source of food and other aid in recent years. If North Korea reneges on its promise to disable its nuclear arms program by the end of this year, the United States is likely to ask South Korea to apply pressure on North Korea, a step the Roh administration had been reluctant to take. Mr. Lee’s victory was welcome news for those South Koreans who believe that Mr. Roh and his predecessor, Kim Dae-jung, did not put enough pressure on North Korea to bring home thousands of people who South Koreans believe were kidnapped by North Korea during and after the Korean War, from 1950 to 1953. “For the past 10 years, we have been crossing our fingers for this day to come,” Lee Mi-il, president of the Korean War Abductees Family Union, said, referring to the new leadership. President Bush called on President-elect Lee on Thursday to congratulate him on his election and to invite him to Washington once he is inaugurated, said Na Kyong-won, a spokeswoman for Mr. Lee. The president-elect accepted the invitation. “It is my wish to strengthen bilateral ties with the United States,” Ms. Na quoted Mr. Lee as telling Mr. Bush. “I will do my best to resolve the North Korean nuclear problem through cooperation and a strengthened relationship with the United States.” Japan’s prime minister, Yasuo Fukuda, who took office three months ago, said he hoped to “cooperate closely” with Mr. Lee. Relations between South Korea and Japan, its past colonial master, remain rough despite thriving trade ties. Mr. Roh and two predecessors of Mr. Fukuda, Junichiro Koizumi and Shinzo Abe, often clashed over issues related to Japanese wartime aggression, and both sides were accused of playing to their nationalistic home audiences. “In this election, the Korean people opted for pragmatism over ideology,” Mr. Lee said. He indicated that he would do something Mr. Roh had avoided: vigorously raise nuclear issues during talks between the Koreas. Such talks, including an October meeting between Mr. Roh and Kim Jong-il, North Korea’s leader, have resulted in numerous joint projects aimed at helping the North’s crippled economy. “The most important thing is for North Korea to get rid of its nuclear weapons,” Mr. Lee said. “Serious economic exchanges between the two Koreas can only start after the North dismantles its nuclear weapons.”

Thousands of South Korean families are still waiting to hear from loved ones taken to North Korea as prisoners during the Korean War over a century ago.

SEOUL,South Korea— In 1997, 22 years after Choi Wook-il’s fishing boat was seized byNorth Korea, members of Mr. Choi’s family in South Korea received their first word from him. The letter, relayed through China, was addressed to Mr. Choi’s brother because Mr. Choi assumed that his wife had long since remarried. He asked his brother to look after her and their four children. Then he added: “I see birds flying freely in the blue sky. I see fish swimming freely in the blue sea. Why can’t people travel freely?” When she read this, Mr. Choi’s wife, who had not remarried, knew at last not only that he was alive, but also that he wanted to escape. It took nearly a decade, with several failed rescue missions, but she finally succeeded in helping him escape late last year. Still, there are few unreservedly happy endings to stories of families caught up in the Korean divide: Mr. Choi’s reunion with his wife, Yang Jong-ja, and their children meant abandoning a second family he had formed in the North. Thousands of South Korean families are still waiting to hear from loved ones taken to North Korea as prisoners during the Korean War more than half a century ago or kidnapped in the decades that followed. About 500 South Korean soldiers captured during the war are thought to be alive in the North, with 480 civilians, mostly fishermen, who were kidnapped in the years since, according to the South Korean government. It is unclear how many of the estimated 80,000 civilians who were taken to North Korea during the war may still be alive. Only a few dozen have returned. Many of them, like Mr. Choi, now 67, made their way home in perilous smuggling operations. The fate of the abducted South Koreans remains an emotional issue. Since the groundbreaking meeting between PresidentRoh Moo-hyun’s predecessor, Kim Dae-jung, and Kim Jong-il in 2000, South Korea has repatriated 63 convicted North Korean spies, increased aid to the North and expanded trade relations. But the South Korean government has been reluctant to challenge North Korea’s denials that it had abducted any South Koreans,  even though Kim Jong-il admitted in 2002 that North Korea had kidnapped 13 Japanese citizens, and released 5 of them. The North says it takes the matter seriously but seeks a nonconfrontational resolution. “When President Kim came to Pyongyang, I had high expectations of seeing my family again,” said Mr. Choi, now 67, before  Mr. Roh and Mr. Kim held their first meeting in North Korea in early October. “But it didn’t happen. This time, I hope President Roh will remember there are still people like me in the North.” Mr. Roh said he raised the issue with Mr. Kim, but they were unable to reach an agreement. On Aug. 18, 1975, Mr. Choi’s trawler was headed to Jumunjin, on South Korea’s northeastern coast, when it was intercepted by a North Korean gunboat. A South Korean search party returned after five days, without finding the boat or the 33 crew members. They were believed to have been lost at sea. As is usual in such cases, the North Koreans would not allow the boat’s crew members to leave, or tell their families they were alive. After a year of ideological indoctrination, Mr. Choi was assigned to a collective farm. “The difficult part was that I had once lived in a free country,” he said. “In the North, you cannot move freely. You have to attend a self-criticism session every 10 days. You have to plant your rice strictly according to party guidelines. No flexibility is allowed.” In 1979, his hopes of going home diminishing, Mr. Choi married a North Korean widow with two daughters. They had a son, now 28, and a daughter, 26. In Jumunjin, occasional visits by the police inquiring about her husband led Ms. Yang to suspect that he was alive, though fortune tellers told her he was dead. “I was just busy scratching out a living,” she said. “I tried my hand at every menial job: pulling coal carts, laying bricks, peddling dried fish and vegetables. “Then the letter arrived.” In 1997, North Korea was gripped by a famine that left as many as two million people dead. The government eased border controls, allowing  people to seek food in China.  Mr. Choi saw a chance to contact his family. When his North Korean wife secured a permit to visit relatives in China, he gave her the letter to send to his brother. Shortly after receiving the letter, Mr. Choi’s brother died. “Whether he knew it or not,” Ms. Yang said of her husband, “I was now his only hope.” Ms. Yang turned to an advocate for divided families, Choi Sung-yong,  the son of a fisherman thought to have been abducted. In 2000, Choi Sung-yong began using his North Korean contacts, who communicated by cellphone,  to find out whether Choi Wook-il wanted to escape. North Korea often punishes people who try to flee with incarceration, or even execution. When the first messengers arrived, Mr. Choi said, he feared he was being set up. He said he had no choice but to report some of them to the police. Surveillance was tightened around his home, and four messengers were arrested. In 2004, a woman brought him a letter from Ms. Yang, saying that she was in China and wanted to meet with him. Mr. Choi sent the woman away. But he said he read the letter three times, memorizing every line. Then he burned it without showing it to anyone — not even his North Korean family, for fear that they could be considered accomplices if things went wrong. By 2006, under pressure from Ms. Yang, Choi Sung-yong was growing impatient. “I told my messengers: ‘I don’t care how you bring him out. Just do it, even if you have to put him into a sack,’” he said. The 10th attempt to make contact came last December, when a man and a woman arrived at Choi Wook-il’s home. This time, Mr. Choi decided to take the chance. He told them to meet him in a local market the next morning. They gave him a forged travel permit. When he left, he did not tell his North Korean family where he was going. “I said I would be gone just for a few days,” he said. “I believe my family has been banished from our village because of me.” Mr. Choi and his two escorts crossed into China on Dec. 25, having bribed border guards. The next day, as Ms. Yang was taking a break from her job cleaning apartments, she received the call from Mr. Choi. After three decades, they could hardly recognize each other’s voices. “To confirm that I was her husband, she asked where we used to live and what kind of work we did together before I went to the North,” he said. “When I told her how in the early, difficult days of our marriage, we used to sell dried persimmons in the market, she just cried.” On Dec. 31, Ms. Yang was reunited with Mr. Choi in a safe house in Yanji, a Chinese city near the North Korean border. “Nothing was left of the young man I had sent off to sea; he was so thin,” she said. “But he still had his old nose, eyes and lips. We hugged each other and cried.” After Mr. Choi’s escape was reported by the press, he was taken in by the South Korean Consulate in Shenyang, China. In January he arrived in South Korea. Leaving the North was “like emerging from the dark,” he said. But whenever he sees his South Korean children’s clothes and Ms. Yang serves meat, he said, he recalls the privations his family in the North is suffering. Ms. Yang said that she felt sorry for Mr. Choi’s other wife, who has now lost a husband, and that she hoped that she and their children could come to the South. “I once asked him whether the North Korean woman was on his mind,” Ms. Yang said. “He just said no, then turned away and didn’t say anything more.”

SEOUL, South Korea — In a sign of a possible easing of tensions between North andSouth Korea, the two countries agreed on Friday to hold a series of reunions of families separated by the Korean War, with 100 families from each side to be reunited at the Diamond Mountain resort in the North from Oct. 30 to Nov. 5. Red Cross officials from both Koreas met Friday to finalize the details of the reunions, and a spokeswoman from South Korea’s Unification Ministry said  that a concession byNorth Koreahad made the deal possible. There was no immediate indication that the dramatic changes in the North Korean political hierarchy announced this week were connected to the breakthrough on the reunion issue. At a landmark party meeting in the North Korean capital,Kim Jong-un, the youngest son of the leader Kim Jong-il,emerged as the heir apparentto  his father. Two previous negotiations on the reunion issueended in stalemateas North Korea refused to hold the gatherings at a family center at Diamond Mountain. South Korean government officials said the North was insisting that the South resume tours of the jointly operated resort, located in North Korea’s southeast. The tours, a source of hard currency for the North, were suspended by the South in 2008 after aSouth Korean tourist was shot and killedby a North Korean guard after she apparently strayed into a restricted zone. On Friday, the North retracted its demand, saying the family center would be an acceptable venue and the reunions could go ahead. “North Korea changed its position and agreed to hold the reunions without any preconditions,” said Lee Jong-joo, the ministry spokeswoman. “They said they want the Diamond Mountain tours restarted, but this time it wasn’t a precondition.” Ms. Lee said the Koreas would hold talks about restarting the tours, but no date for those negotiations has been set. She added that the South Korean families who will participate  would be chosen Friday night through a computer-generated lottery. In April of this year, a month after the sinking of a South Korean warship, which the South has blamed on the North,North Korea confiscated five Diamond Mountain buildingsowned by the South Korean government. The North said it had suffered monetary losses from the South’s suspension of tours. The reunion center was among the facilities seized. More than 20,000 Korean families have gathered — if only briefly — in a series of reunions during the past 10 years under the auspices of the Red Cross. South Korea has wanted the reunions to be held regularly and more frequently, and with more families included, so aging Koreans can meet with their relatives before they die. The issue is a sensitive and emotional one in South Korea, where many people feel a strong kinship to North Koreans, despite the countries’ often bellicose antagonism. Many Korean families found themselves divided at the close of the Korean War, which ended in 1953 with a truce rather than a formal treaty. The South Korean Red Cross has said about 80,000 South Koreans have yet to be reunited with their relatives in the North.

A convoy crossed into North Korea on Friday, carrying food to the North for the first time in nearly three years.

SEOUL, South Korea — A convoy of trucks crossed the border withNorth Koreaon Friday, carrying the first South Korean rice donations for North Korea in nearly three years, as officials from both Koreas huddled to discuss the reunion of families separated by the Korean War six decades ago. The humanitarian gestures followed months of tensions set off by thesinking of a South Korean warshipin March in what Seoul concluded was a North Korean torpedo attack. Forty-six sailors died in the sinking. The nine trucks in the convoy carried 203 tons of rice that civic groups and opposition political parties inSouth Koreahad donated for the victims of recent flooding in North Korea. The flooding is expected to worsen food shortages in the North, which even in a year of good harvests, cannot produce enough to feed its estimated population of 23 million people properly. The shipment, coming just before the Korean harvest festival of Chuseok next week, also seemed to symbolize a newfound South Korean good will toward the North. It followed 530 tons of flour that a South Korean provincial government and civic groups sent on Thursday. After President Lee Myung-bak came to power in Seoul in early 2008, South Korea had been reluctant to provide rice or any other major aid shipments to the North until its government in Pyongyang  took significant steps to give up itsnuclear weapons. The sinking of the warship, theCheonan, further soured relations. But in the past week, the South approved the civic groups’ donations, as well as a separate Red Cross plan to send 5,000 tons of rice. The approval followed conciliatory gestures by North Korea, including a plan to resume a Red Cross program of arranging temporary unions of families split by the 1950-53 Korean War. In the North Korean border town of Kaesong, officials from both Koreas discussed the date, venue and size of the proposed reunions. The last such reunions were held a year ago. North Korea wanted to hold the reunions at its Diamond Mountain resort in late October, said Chun Hae-sung, a government spokesman in Seoul. South Korea demanded that the two sides make reunions regular and more frequent to allow aging Koreans to come together, even briefly, with their relatives before they die. Both American and South Korean officials insist that North Korea should make more gestures of reconciliation toward South Korea before six-party talks can resume on ending the North’s nuclear weapons program. “I don’t think six-party talks can proceed properly without improvement in relations between the Koreas,” said Hyun In-taek, the unification minister of South Korea, in a speech at a forum in Seoul on Friday.

SEOUL, South Korea  — North Korean military representatives held preliminary talks on Thursday  with the American-led United Nations Command to set up a meeting between generals on both sides to discuss the sinking of a South Korean warship. South Koreaand the United States blameNorth Koreafor the sinking, which killed 46 sailors. The United Nations command called for a meeting at the level of generals  to protest the sinking, which it considers a violation of the 1953 armistice that halted the Korean War. During their 90-minute working-level talks at the border village of Panmunjom on Thursday,  representatives from both sides offered  proposals on general-level talks and agreed to confirm details after more consultations with their superiors, the command said. North Korea has denied  involvement in the March 26 sinking. The United Nations Security Council adopted a statement last Friday that condemned the sinking but stopped short of directly blaming North Korea. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton  are scheduled to meet their South Korean counterparts in Seoul on Wednesday to discuss their alliance. Afterward the allies plan to hold joint naval exercises in waters around South Korea in a show of force, defense officials here said Thursday.

The North vowed a “merciless strike” against South Korea’s propaganda loudspeakers.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Korearenewed its threats on Saturday to destroy South Korean propaganda loudspeakers, vowing a “merciless strike” that could turn Seoul into “a sea of flame.” While such bellicose language is common in North Korea’s official news media, the threats underscore the continuing tensions here since the March sinking of a South Korean warship.South Koreahas responded with measures like curtailing trade with the North and resuming psychological warfare broadcasts along heavily fortified border between the nations. The broadcasts are seen as a largely symbolic gesture by the South to signal that the sinking has pushed ties back to an era of hostility reminiscent of the cold war. The South is building a dozen sets of huge speakers to blare propaganda into the North. South Korea’s conservative president, Lee Myung-bak, has struggled to find ways to punish the North for the sinking of theCheonan,  which an investigation ruled last month was the result of a torpedo attack by a North Korean submarine. On Saturday, the General Staff of the Korean People’s Army, the North Korean military, issued a statement saying that the North would carry out an attack to destroy propaganda facilities along the border. It said the attack would be “a merciless strike foreseeing even the turn of Seoul” into “a sea of flames.” Seoul, a city of 10 million residents that is the South’s political and economic hub, lies within artillery range of North Korean forces amassed along the Demilitarized Zone. The threats, which were carried by the state-run Korean Central News Agency, came a day after South Korea’s defense minister told Parliament that the loudspeakers would begin broadcasting after the United Nations Security Council decided on new measures against the North. There had been talk in the South about delaying the broadcasts. But Mr. Lee has vowed to take a tough line on the North for the sinking, which killed 46 sailors.

Is a lack of outrage over the Cheonan sinking potentially dangerous?
==::==
2010-05-28T00:00:00Z
==::==
Busan, South Korea ONE of the students at my university was killed in the attack that sank a South Korean naval vessel on March 26. A visual communications major, Mun Yeong-uk was only a few months from concluding his military servicewhen a North Korean torpedo split the warship, the Cheonan, in half.His classmates loyally collected money for his family’s funeral expenses, but I was struck by how few people on our campus evinced any real anger toward the regime of Kim Jong-il. This lack of indignation is mainstream here. Most people now accept North Korea’s responsibility for the sinking that killed Mr. Mun and 45 other sailors. A small but sizable minority suspect an elaborate government conspiracy  of some sort. What almost all seem to share is the desire that South Korea put this unfortunate business behind it as soon as possible. Support for military retaliation appears confined to those too old to fight. Eventhe rather mild measuresthat the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, announced on Monday — which included the drastic reduction of inter-Korean trade and resumption of the propaganda war along the demilitarized zone — have caused widespread hand-wringing. The general reluctance to take the North Koreans to task can be partly attributed to a rational apprehension of the military realities. No one here needs to be reminded that Kim Jong-il could bomb Seoul flat even without using his new nuclear capacity. And in a country where all fit young men must spend two years  in the military, “chicken hawks” are much harder to come by than in America. But historical and cultural factors are also at work. By this I do not mean only the collective memory of the Korean War and its manifold horrors. Up until the late 1980s, right-wing governments resorted to North Korea scares so often that many people now refuse to believe any stories about the regime, no matter how overwhelming the evidence. If President Lee thought he could allay doubts with an especially thorough investigation into the sinking, he was mistaken. Left-wing newspapers now accuse him of postponing the announcement of the investigation’s results to exert maximum influence on next week’s regional elections. It would be unfair to characterize these skeptics as pro-Pyongyang, but there is more sympathy for North Korea here than foreigners commonly realize. As a university student in West Berlin in the 1980s, I had a hard time finding even a Marxist with anything nice to say about East Germany. In South Korea, however, the North’s human rights abuses are routinely shrugged off with reference to its supposedly superior nationalist credentials. One often hears, for example, the mistaken claim that Mr. Kim’s father, Kim Il-sung, purged his republic of former Japanese collaborators, in alleged contrast to the morally tainted South. Sympathy for Pyongyang is especially widespread in the peninsula’s chronically disgruntled southwest, and not just because this farming region profits whenever food aid is sent to the North. Gwangju, the largest city in the region, just commemorated the 30th anniversary of a brutal government massacre of civilian demonstrators, many of whom were defamed in the official news media of the time as North Korean agents. South Korean nationalism is something quite different from the patriotism toward the state that Americans feel. Identification with the Korean race is strong, while that with the Republic of Korea is weak. (Kim Jong-il has a distinct advantage here: his subjects are more likely to equate their state with the race itself.) Thus few South Koreans feel personally affected by the torpedo attack. Besides, Koreans in both the North and the South tend to cherish the myth that of all peoples in the world, they are the least inclined to premeditated evil. The sinking of the Cheonan is widely viewed here as an almost spontaneous byproduct of inter-Korean tension — a regrettable aberration that should not be made too much of. The left attributes the recent increase of tension to President Lee’s rejection of his predecessors’ accommodationist Sunshine Policy. Yet even the conservative news media talk of the attack in terms of an “error” that the North should own up to, not a cold-blooded act. Students in my classes tend to refer to the sinking as an “accident.” This urge to give the North Koreans the benefit of the doubt is in marked contrast tothe public fury that erupted after the killingsof two South Korean schoolgirls by an American military vehicle in 2002; it was widely claimed that the Yankees murdered them callously. Duringthe street protests against American beef importsin the wake of a mad cow disease scare in 2008, posters of a child-poisoning Uncle Sam were all the rage. It is illuminating to compare those two anti-American frenzies with the small and geriatric protests against Pyongyang that have taken place in Seoul in recent weeks. Such are the unique circumstances under which President Lee has tried to marshal a firm and unified response to the North’s latest provocation. So far he has done an excellent job, conveying just the right mixture of resolve and restraint. Where American presidents tend to personalize conflict with foreign powers, Mr. Lee refrained from explicitly blaming Kim Jong-il for the sinking; this may make it a little easier for the dictator to issue an apology without losing face. Even as the North threatens “all-out war,” the Obama administration would do well to emulate the South Korean leader. It should be mindful enough of Korean nationalism to hold back on its own rhetoric. It would be counterproductive if Washington were to look more interested in punishing North Korea than the injured party is.

SEOUL, South Korea — Forensic experts investigating the wreckage of a South Korean warship that sank near the sea border withNorth Koreahave found traces of an explosive component commonly used in torpedoes and mines,South Korea’s defense minister said Monday. The 1,200-ton corvette, the Cheonan,sank on March 26after a mysterious blast split the ship in half. The South Korean government has said a torpedo attack was the likely cause of the blast, and many South Koreans say they believe the North was responsible. North Korea has denied any involvementin the sinking. “It is true that traces of RDX, a chemical substance used in making torpedoes, have been found,” Defense Minister Kim Tae-young said Monday, referring to a component common to many military explosives. He said that there was “a high possibility” that a torpedo was the cause of the explosion, but that it was also too soon to conclude definitively that it was the cause. The material was found on the ship’s smokestack and in samples of sand from the site of the sinking, said Rear Adm. Moon Byung-ok, a spokesman for the investigation team. He noted that RDX is also used in making mines. During the briefing on Monday, neither Mr. Kim nor Admiral Moon mentioned North Korea. Forty-six South Korean sailors were killed or remain missing in the explosion.

SEOUL, South Korea — The South Korean military vowed revenge without identifying a target as the country gave an emotional farewell on Thursday to the sailors killed when their ship sank last month near a disputed sea border withNorth Korea. If the ship is found to have been torpedoed by North Korea, as many South Koreans suspect, it will amount to one of the most serious provocations from the North in recent decades. Seoul has repeatedly vowed “stern countermeasures” buthas shied from publicly discussing its optionsuntil an investigation is over. Military retaliation, however, is unlikely, analysts say. “We’ll never forgive whoever inflicted this great pain on us,” said the navy chief of staff, Kim Sung-chan, at a mass funeral for the victims on Thursday in the port city of Pyeongtaek, about 45 miles south of Seoul, home of the ship’s naval base. “We will track them down to the end and we will, by all means, make them pay for this.” Sirens wailed, flags flew at half-staff  and navy ships sounded whistles asSouth Koreahonored the 40 sailors known to have died and 6 others who are missing and presumed dead. There is widespread suspicion among South Koreans that the ship washit by a North Korean torpedo. Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, said on Thursday that he noticed “uncharacteristic reticence and nervousness” among South Korean officials although, metaphorically, “they found a body with a bullet hole in the head and North Korea was the only guy in the room with the pistol.” Mr. Klingner has met South Korean officials in the past week over the ship’s sinking. Investigators are studying thesalvaged wreck of the ship, which broke in half on March 26. They are also searching the seabed for evidence of what caused the explosion. South Korea’s defense minister has said a heavy torpedo was the most likely cause, although he has not openly blamed North Korea,which has denied involvement. More than 2,000 guests, including President Lee Myung-bak and foreign ambassadors, attended the funeral. Mothers of the sailors wailed as they clasped their sons’ photos and the urns containing their ashes. The families of the six missing sailors burned their naval uniforms and personal belongings and buried those ashes on Thursday. The name of each sailor was read out while Mr. Lee placed a military medal on an altar before the sailor’s photograph.

Five South Korean-owned facilities at a jointly operated mountain resort were seized on Friday, and the North called the president of South Korea a “traitor.”

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreaconfiscated five facilities owned bySouth Koreaat a jointly operated mountain resort on Friday, and it called South Korea’s president a “traitor” and accused him of defaming the North’s most important holiday. The unilateral seizures and harsh comments were indicative of the tensions that have been rising between the Koreas since a South Korean warship sank in a mysterious explosion on March 26. Although President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea has not yet blamed the North for the sinking, he hasvowed to find the causeof the disaster and he has delivered unusually harsh criticisms of North Korea amid a growing suspicion in the South that the ship may have been hit by a North Korean torpedo. North Korea hasdenied any involvementin the sinking, which killed 39 South Korean sailors. Seven seamen are still missing and presumed dead. “The North must get its senses back,” Mr. Lee said this week, discussing what he considered to be a wasteful display of fireworks in the impoverished country on April 15, a national holiday in North Korea. The holiday celebrates the birth of Kim Il-sung, the founder of the modern North Korean state and the father of the current leader, Kim Jong-il. “Can’t they realize how much corn they can buy with the money they spent on the fireworks?” Mr. Lee said. On Friday, North Korea accused Mr. Lee of meddling with its sacrosanct holiday. Kim Il-sung, memorialized in North Korea as the country’s “eternal president,” is revered as a demigod among the elite. North Korea said it was confiscating five buildings at the Diamond Mountain resort — a spa, a cultural center, a fire station, a duty-free shop and a reunion center for families separated by the Korean War — to compensate for the losses it says it has suffered since South Korea suspended tours to the resort, which is in the North. South Korea has refused to resume the tours until the North agrees to a joint investigation of the shooting death of a South Korean tourist by North Korean soldiers at the resort in 2008. The Diamond Mountain tour had been a critical source of hard currency for the North. “This only shows that North Korea is not an entity with which one can do normal commercial deals and business,” the South Korean government said Friday in a statement, referring to the confiscations. “We make it clear that North Korea should be held responsible for worsening South-North Korean relations.” North Korea rejected any role in the warship explosion, and a statement carried by its official news agency, K.C.N.A., said the peninsula was now “at the crossroads of a war or peace.” South Korea opened an international investigation after its 1,200-ton ship sank near the disputed western sea border with the North. “Just as the investigation is being conducted with international cooperation, so we will try to cooperate with the international community in taking necessary measures when the results are out,” Mr. Lee told a group of visiting foreign journalists on Friday. “We are focusing on producing results that are thorough, scientific and acceptable to the international community,” Mr. Lee said. Analysts have suggested various options available to South Korea if the North is found to be responsible, among them a United Nations resolution and sanctions, a suspension of trade relations and aid for the North and attacks on North Korean ships venturing across the disputed sea border. But if investigators fail to find convincing evidence of North Korean involvement, the analysts said, Mr. Lee will have difficulty persuading other countries, especially China, to take punitive actions against the North, even if many South Koreans are already blaming the North for the sinking.

President Lee Myung-bak became the first South Korean head of state to visit the disputed waters off the Korean Peninsula, after a navy ship sank there last week.

SEOUL, South Korea — President Lee Myung-bak became the first South Korean head of state to visit the disputed western waters off the Korean Peninsula as he visited to urge rescuers on Tuesday to continue searching for 46 sailors believed to be trapped ina naval vessel that sankafter a mysterious explosion four days earlier. The president arrived by helicopter — within the range of North Korean artillery — to encourage rescue officials and console relatives of the missing sailors, telling them, “I wish I could plunge into the water myself.” Fifty-eight sailors were rescued in the hours after Friday’s explosion, which split the ship in half, but none have been found since, alive or dead. Hopes were dimming for any crewmen who might be alive but running out of air in watertight cabins. Shortly after Mr. Lee left the scene, the military announced that a 53-year-old navy diver engaged in the rescue operation had fallen unconscious and died. Two other divers passed out but were recovering. They were among dozens of navy frogmen who have struggled with strong currents and poor underwater visibility in the effort to reach a chunk of the ship that lies mired in mud 132 feet down and another section four miles away. Despite their repeated attempts, they have so far been unable to break into any cabins, said  Rear Adm. Lee Ki-shik of the South Korean Navy. The diver who died, Han Ju-ho, did not regain consciousness despite the efforts of colleagues who were trying to revive him in a decompression chamber on board the United States Seventh Fleet’s rescue vessel Salvo, officials said. The 3,000-ton Salvo and three other American Navy ships arrived Monday to assist in rescue operations. On Tuesday, the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff asked their American counterparts to send hospital and evacuation helicopters, after President Lee pressed for more cooperation with the American military. The United States keeps about 25,000 troops inSouth Korea, a legacy of American intervention in the 1950-53 Korean War. Admiral Lee said the cause of the explosion would not be known until the ship’s wreckage was raised and examined, a matter of days at the least. South Korea said it was investigating the possibility that the ship was hit by a North Korean mine or torpedo. The navies of the two Koreas have fought skirmishes in the disputed western waters in 1999 and 2002 andexchanged fire brieflylast November.

The offer to ship 10,000 tons of corn to North Korea in what would be the first government-funded humanitarian aid for the North in nearly two years.

SEOUL,South Korea— South Korea offered Monday to ship 10,000 tons of corn toNorth Koreain what would be the  first such government-financed aid  in nearly two years. The offer is far smaller than what South Korea used to ship  — 500,000 tons of rice and 300,000 tons of chemical fertilizer —  to help the North make up itsyearly food shortagesof up to a million tons. After President Lee Myung-bak took office early last year, inter-Korean relations chilled rapidly when hemade any large-scale aidconditional on progress  in talks aimed at  endingNorth Korea’s nuclear weaponsprogram. Demonstrating its military resolve this year, North Korea has test-fired missiles anddetonated a nuclear device,drawing United Nations sanctions. But it has recently begunreaching out for talkswith the United States and South Korea. Mr. Lee’s small offer of aid suggested  that he was seeking a way to respond without diminishing the impact of the sanctions or repeating what Mr. Lee had called a critical mistake of his liberal predecessors: coddling the rigid and secretive North Korean government with large aid. North Korea asked for food aid during recent Red Cross talks with South Korea in return for allowing temporary reunions of Koreans separated by the 1950-53  war. In a message to the North on Monday, the South Korean Red Cross Society said  it was willing to provide the corn, as well as 20 tons of powdered milk and medical supplies. The package will cost 4.1 billion won, or $3.5 million, officials said. “It’s difficult to say 10,000 tons are enough considering the North’s food shortages, but North Korea did not specify the size or items when it asked for humanitarian assistance,” said Chun Hae-sung, a spokesman of the Unification Ministry, responsible for South Korea’s dealings with the North. “Regarding additional assistance, there is nothing we’re considering.” The North has faced chronic food shortages anddepended on outside aidto help feed its 23 million people since bad weather and mismanagement destroyed its economy in the mid-1990s. This week, a senior North Korean nuclear envoy is traveling in the United States for talks that Washington hopes will lead to the revival of dormant six-nation talks on ending the North’snuclear weaponsprogram in exchange for aid and diplomatic recognition.

Unsatisfied with North Korea’s explanation for its release of dam water that created a flash flood in the South that killed at least three people, South Korea demanded a formal apology from the North.

SEOUL,South Korea— Unsatisfied withNorth Korea’s explanation for its release of dam water, which created a flash flood in the South that killed at least five people, South Korea on Tuesday demanded a formal apology from the North. “We demand that the responsible authorities in the North offer a full explanation and an apology for causing our civilians’ deaths,” Chun Hae-sung, spokesman of the Unification Ministry in Seoul, said in a statement. On Sunday morning, without warning, North Koreaunleashed columns of waterfrom its Hwanggang Dam, 26 miles north of the border with the South. The resulting flood swept away six South Koreans who were camping or fishing farther downstream. Three bodies were found Monday, and the police said two more bodies were found Wednesday, including that of an 8-year-old boy. The apology demand suggested that the government of President Lee Myung-bak would stick to its hard line on the North despite having received recent conciliatory gestures. Mr. Lee has been under pressure at home to seek a fuller explanation from North Korea over the flooding. But by demanding an apology that would be taken as a loss of face by the government in Pyongyang, Mr. Lee also risks pushing the North back into belligerent isolation. There was no immediate reaction Tuesday from North Korea, which had said it was forced to act “urgently” over the weekend when water levels at the dam on the Imjin River became dangerously high. It also promised to notify the South about similar releases of water in the future. But that did little to mollify the South, with the Unification Ministry saying that the explanation “does not satisfy us” and faulting the North for failing to mention the deaths. South Korea first demanded an explanation on Monday. Later in the day — in an unusually rapid response — the North gave its reply about high water levels. But South Korean officials said they found the explanation unsatisfactory because there had been no heavy rain in the North in recent days. South Korea has long feared a “water offensive” from the North. In recent years, North Korea has been building dams on rivers that flow into South Korea, raising the possibility that a sudden release of water, by accident or design, could cause damage in the South. “We haven’t found any evidence yet that North Korea released its Hwanggang Dam as a water attack,” said Won Tae-je, a Defense Ministry spokesman. Still, he said, the episode compels South Korea to “seriously consider” civil defense drills against a possible water attack. The South Korean military and government were criticized on Monday for failing to notice the sudden rise in the water level and warn people downstream. South Korean television showed a military tank mired in a flooded field. The Imjin basin is one of the most militarized zones in the South. The river’s water level on the border jumped to 15.1 feet from 7.5 feet on Sunday morning. The Hwanggang Dam was completed in 2007. Short of fuel, North Korea says it builds dams for electricity. Still, South Korea is building a dam downstream as a bulwark against a possible deluge released from the North. Relations between the Koreas chilled rapidly after the2008 inauguration of Mr. Lee, whom the North called a traitor. But in recent weeks, North Korea has alternated harsh statements  with conciliatory diplomatic gestures.

South Korea held a state funeral on Sunday for former President Kim Dae-jung, whose death brought the first major meeting with the North in nearly two years.

SEOUL,South Korea— As South Korea held a state funeral on Sunday for former PresidentKim Dae-jung, North Korean delegates wrapped up their visit to the South. In the first such high-level political meeting between the two Koreas in nearly two years, PresidentLee Myung-bakof South Koreamet with officials from the Northwho came to Seoul to pay respects to Mr. Kim. Through the delegation, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, said he wanted to improve ties with South Korea, officials said. During a 30-minute meeting with Mr. Lee, the North Korean delegation relayed Mr. Kim’s “verbal message regarding making progress in South-North cooperation,” Lee Dong-kwan, Mr. Lee’s chief spokesman, told reporters. “To this, President Lee explained our government’s consistent and firm policy towardNorth Koreaand asked the delegates to relay his position to Chairman Kim.” Relations between the North and the South have cooled — and the legacy of Kim Dae-jung’s “Sunshine Policy” of reconciliation with North Korea has crumbled — since Mr. Lee took office in February 2008. Mr. Lee vowed not to provide aid to the North unless it made concrete progress in dismantling itsnuclear weaponsprogram. The North lashed out by cutting off dialogue with the Lee government. Relations deteriorated, and tensions grew, when North Korea conducted nuclear and missile tests earlier this year. For Mr. Lee, the delegates’ visit represented a sharp change in mood; only a year ago, North Korea had called him a traitor. North Korea, however, has changed its tone in recent weeks. North Korean officialsmet with former President Bill Clintonin Pyongyang, the North’s capital, on Aug. 4, and then released two American journalists and a South Korean worker, all of whom had been held for months on charges of committing hostile acts against the North. Kim Dae-jung’s death on Tuesday provided the North Korean leader with an opportunity to reach out to Mr. Lee. The North quickly lifted restrictions on cross-border traffic with South Korea, and dispatched a delegation to Seoul on Friday, in a move that several South Korean analysts portrayed as an attempt by the North to get badly needed aid flowing again. The delegation was led by Kim Ki-nam, a secretary of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party, and Kim Yang-gon, the North’s intelligence chief, who also handles relations with South Korea. Unification Minister Hyun In-taek of South Korea, who met with Kim Yang-gon for 80 minutes on Saturday, said earlier that he hoped the North Korean delegates’ meeting with President Lee would “become a turning point in South-North Korean relations.” In a separate meeting on Saturday with South Korean politicians and scholars, Kim Yang-gon suggested more economic ties between the two Koreas,according to Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, quoting people who attended the meeting. Some 30,000 politicians, foreign dignitaries and citizens attended the state funeral of former President Kim, held Sunday on a National Assembly lawn under a blazing sun and televised nationally. Citizens lined the streets as a motorcade carrying Mr. Kim’s body traveled slowly through downtown Seoul on its way to the national cemetery. Mr. Kim’s transition from a dissident and death-row inmate under past military rule to a president and then aNobel laureatesymbolized his own country’s evolution, from a war-torn, staunchly anti-Communist dictatorship into a prosperous Asian democracy confident enough to embrace Communist North Korea. Many say that Mr. Kim’s best moment came when he traveled to Pyongyang and met with Kim Jong-il in 2000 in the first summit meeting between the Koreas, leading to an unprecedented easing of tensions. South Koreans grew disappointed in recent years when North Korea conducted nuclear tests despite billions of dollars South Korea had provided in aid and trade under the Sunshine Policy. They voted against that policy when they elected Mr. Lee in December 2007.

The South Korean government has agreed to allow North Korean diplomats to travel to Seoul to bring a funeral wreath for the former South Korean president Kim Dae-jung.

HONG KONG — The South Korean government has agreed to allow North Korean diplomats to travel to Seoul on Friday to bring a funeral wreath for the former South Korean presidentKim Dae-jung. Several North Korean envoys are due to fly to Seoul on Friday and depart on Saturday, according to Seon Mi-kim, a press official withSouth Korea’s Unification Ministry. The timing of the trip suggests the North Koreans will not attend the state funeral, which has been scheduled for Sunday afternoon. Instead, they are expected to meet with Mr. Kim’s widow, Lee Hee-ho, and other relatives, and perhaps visit a memorial altar at the National Assembly. Following a series of recent conciliatory gestures, including a personal message of condolence from the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, the North floated the idea of a cross-border trip on Wednesday. The South agreed to the proposal on Thursday. Kim Dae-jung, who died Tuesday at age 85, had traveled toNorth Koreafor a landmark summit meeting in 2000 — including a now-famous handshake with Kim Jong-il. As president from 1998-2003, his “sunshine policy” achieved a rare rapprochement with the North. Those policies have essentially been reversed by the current South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak. South Korea canceled the first satellite launching from its own territory on Wednesday only seven minutes before the planned liftoff, momentarily averting new friction with North Korea. The North, which was widely denounced for launching a rocket this year, was angered by subsequent United Nations sanctions and has said the same punitive standards should be applied to the South. But North Korea has taken steps in recent weeks, including releasing two American journalists and a South Korean worker, that have calmed tensions somewhat with the United States and on the Korean Peninsula. In the last several days, North Korea declared its intention to reopen its highly militarized border to groups of tourists and to pursue possible new business ventures with the South. In the latest sign of a thaw, two diplomats from North Korea met Wednesday with Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, who twice went to North Korea in the 1990s to secure the release of Americans. Mr. Richardson declined to comment on the substance of the talks or say why North Korea requested the meeting, but he called it a “hopeful sign” of improving relations, The Associated Press reported.

For Park Chun-hwan, a fisherman abducted by North Korea in 1968, the true ordeal began after he returned to the South.
==::==
2009-08-11T00:00:00Z
==::==
GAEYADO, SOUTH KOREA — When the twice-a-day ferry pulls into this island of 900 people, village dogs trot out to the pier to watch the passengers come ashore. Seagulls wheel overhead as weathered fishermen mend nets on the beach. Women in sunbonnets spread anchovies out to dry. Gaeyado today presents an idyllic scene. But decades ago, the arrival of ferries was anticipated with dread. Often they brought the counterintelligence detectives, agents in successive South Korean military governments’ drives to root out Communists and their sympathizers. The extent of the terror they spread in places like Gaeyado is only now coming to light with the revelations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. This panel was set up in 2005 to investigate dark episodes in modern Korean history, including abuses the South Korean government perpetrated against   fishermen, mostly from the 1960s to the 1980s, in the name of fighting the Communist threat from the North. In the fearful atmosphere of that time, neighbors informed on each other. People were detained and tortured. Families broke apart, and onetime friends — like Park Chun-hwan, now 62, and Im Bong-taek, 61  —  turned on each other. These men’s ordeal began in the spring of 1968. Like every spring,  fishing boats from Gaeyado pursued  schools of croaker as they migrated north, sometimes venturing too far into frontier waters prowled by the navies of both South and  North Korea. Onboard one such boat was the 21-year-old Mr. Park. “That morning, the catch was not so good,” he recalled. “We were about to haul in our net when two North Korean patrol boats appeared out of the fog.” He and the other crew members were taken captive. Some 4,000  South Korean fishermen    were seized by the North in the decades after the   1950-3 Korean War.  Their captors showered these  men with gifts, and tried in   indoctrination sessions to persuade them to renounce the Seoul government and defect to the North. Hundreds of fishermen remained in the North, not all voluntarily. But most, eventually, were allowed to go home. In South Korea, they were treated with suspicion, usually undergoing weeks of interrogation by  police officers seeking any evidence of treason. Often they were jailed for violating fishing regulations. For some, such as Mr. Park, the outcome was far worse. Mr. Park was held in North Korea for five months. Although pressured to defect, he told his captors he wanted to go back to his wife, whom he had married only a month before he was kidnapped. He was released to South Korea, where he was jailed for eight months for straying outside the legal fishing zone. In 1971, with Mr. Park back home and  working on a prawn ship, two detectives came by to “ask a few more questions.” For the next 70 days, Mr. Park says, he was detained in an inn where he was deprived of sleep and forced to write a “confession.” Each evening, he said, he was taken to an underground torture room. The interrogators wanted details. Wasn’t it true he had brought back two “red-covered” Communist books and given them to friends? Where had he hidden the radio he intended to use to  transmit information about local officials and industries to his spy masters in Pyongyang? Hadn’t he raved about the food he had eaten in the North, and about the enthusiastic welcome women had given him when he visited factories there? They made him squeeze his knees into a metal bucket for 24 hours at a time, he said. They shocked him with electricity, splashing him with icy water when he lost consciousness. Finally, he said yes, he had brought back books from North Korea, and named Mr. Im as the friend to whom he had given them. “I thought the torture was going to kill me,” Mr. Park said. “But my friend had a relative in the police, so I hoped he might be O.K.” Now the two friends were both tortured in custody. Mr. Im said his interrogators tied his hands and legs together and hung him upside down, naked, “like a roast chicken,” and beat the soles of his feet. “They kept asking where the books were,” Mr. Im said. “I wished Chun-hwan really had given me books, so I could at least turn them in. I wanted to kill him for involving me in this.” Mr. Park was subjected to the same torture: “Hanging upside down like that for hours, you feel like your face has swollen to twice its size. Blood oozed from my eye sockets.” The men ended up confessing to whatever their torturers seemed to want. Mr. Park was sentenced to seven years in prison for praising and spying for North Korea. Mr. Im was sentenced to eight months for not having reported his friend to the police. During all their time in custody, the two men never met. Mr. Park’s wife died of heart attack and Mr. Im’s father hanged himself. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which is reviewing cases from that era, has concluded that many of the estimated 1,250 fishermen who were tried  from the 1960s to the 1980s   on charges of cooperating with North Korea had confessed to questionable charges under torture. In April, the commission said Mr. Park and Mr. Im were among them and recommended that they receive new trials. Gaeyado had its share of such cases. Between 1960 and 1968, five of its fishing boats were seized by North Korea. At least seven fishermen were sentenced to prison terms of 7 to 12 years  after their return to South Korea. Two were arrested more than 16 years after they had come back home. In each case, the commission found, the suspects’ shipmates, neighbors or relatives were tortured, sometimes for weeks, until they testified against them. Two Gaeyado fishermen recently had their convictions overturned in retrials prompted by the commission’s investigations. Mr. Park and Mr. Im are still awaiting retrial. After Mr. Park’s release from prison in 1979, he left Gaeyado and settled in an inland town. He spent 30 years as a tobacco farmer and now works the night shift at a toothbrush factory. Mr. Im still lives in Gaeyado, making his living catching crabs and raising ducks. He scurries around the island on his scooter, shouting greetings at neighbors. But his eyes misted when he talked about the past. So as not to forget, he recorded his torturers’ names and deeds in a tattered notebook he made out of a used calendar while working as a deckhand on a fishing boat in the mid-1980s. Following their release from prison, the two men did not meet again until  June of this year, when the commission and Gaeyado community arranged a “party of reconciliation.” The entire village was invited, and about 200 people showed up, including the police and other officials. Despite the commission’s urging, there has been no apology from the central government for what the fishermen went through.  But when Mr. Park and Mr. Im met and embraced in tears, old wounds seemed to heal. “I told him I was sorry,” Mr. Park said. “When the detectives told me what Bong-taek had confessed, I imagined the torture he must have suffered because of me. I wanted to smash my head against a wall.” Mr. Im said he had long ago forgiven Mr. Park, because he knew his friend had lied under torture. “I know because I went through the same torture,” he said.

The detainment of the fishing boat after it accidentally crossed into North Korean waters will likely complicate the tense relations between the two countries.

SEOUL,South Korea— A South Korean fishing boat was detained and towed toNorth Koreaon Thursday after it crossed accidentally into North Korean waters, a government spokesman said. The boat, which weighs 29 tons and was fishing for squid,  crossed the maritime border off the east coast into North Korea on Thursday morning after suffering a malfunction in its satellite navigation system, said Chun Hae-sung, a spokesman at the South Korean government’s Unification Ministry. The ministry sent a telephone message to North Korea asking for an early return of the ship and its crew of four. North Korea responded that it was investigating the case, the ministry said. The fate of the crew will probably complicate the already tense relations between the Koreas. Bilateral relations have chilled rapidly since North Korea tested a nuclear bomb in May and South Korea joined international sanctions against the North. North Korea was accused of prowling in South Korean waters and kidnapping South Korean fishing boats in the immediate years after the 1950-53 Korean War. Hundreds of South Korean fishermen from those ships never returned home. Such incidents have become much rarer in recent decades. But fishing boats from either side have occasionally drifted into each other nation’s waters, mainly because of engine trouble. How fast they were released often depended on the mood of bilateral relations at the time. A South Korean fishing boat drifted into North Korea accidentally in December 2006 but was returned home after 18 days. On the other hand, a South Korean worker in the joint industrial complex at the North Korean town of Kaesong has been held since March 30 on charges of insulting the North’s political system. North Korea also continues to hold two American journalists captured at its border with China in March. A court sentenced them to 12 years in labor camp on charges of committing hostile acts against the Communist state.

SEOUL,South Korea—North Koreaconfirmed Tuesday that it was preparing to launch what outside experts believe is a missile theoretically capable of reaching Alaska and Hawaii. But the North insisted that what it planned to launch was a scientific satellite. The North’s announcement came only days after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and South Korea’s foreign minister, Yu Myung-hwan, urged it not to carry out a threatened test-launching, calling such a move “very unhelpful” and “provocative.” During her trip in Asia last week, Mrs. Clinton called the North Korean government’s rule “tyranny,” but offered to normalize ties and provide economic help if the isolated nation abandoned its nuclear weapons program. Officials in the region were eagerly awaiting the North Korean response to Mrs. Clinton’s overture when the announcement came on Tuesday. “Currently, full-fledged preparation is ongoing to launch a test-purpose communication satellite,” North Korea’s state-run news agency, KCNA, said. The statement was the first time North Korea had confirmed its activities at a missile-launching base on its east coast. It did not say when the launching would take place, but the announcement was the clearest sign that it may be imminent. In the past few weeks, North Korea has said it has the right to develop a peaceful space program, a term it used when it test-fired its Taepodong-1 ballistic missile in 1998. After the 1998 launching, North Korea said it had successfully put its Kwangmyongsong-1, or Lodestar-1, satellite, into orbit. On Tuesday, it said it was preparing to launch its Kwangmyongsong-2 satellite atop its Eunha rocket. But officials and experts in the region fear that the rocket is  a multistage Taepodong-2. Over the weekend, Jane’s Defense Weekly reported that satellite imagery showed North Korea could be ready for the launching of the Taepodong-2 missile or a rocket  within a matter of days. On Monday South Korea’s Defense Ministry issued a report saying that  the North had deployed a new intermediate-range ballistic missile that could threaten American military bases in Guam. The new  missile can travel about 1,800 miles carrying a 1,400-pound warhead, which would reach the American territory of Guam in the south Pacific, according to the  Defense Ministry report. Although South Korean officials observed the new missile during a military parade in Pyongyang, the North’s capital, in 2007, this report was the first time they have publicly confirmed their conclusion that it was ready for use.

SEOUL,South Korea— Defense SecretaryRobert M. Gatessaid Tuesday that he supported extending the tours of thousands of troops stationed here to three years and allowing their spouses and children to live with them during their assignments. His endorsement adds momentum to a policy shift favored by commanders to improve the quality of life for most of the 28,500 troops assigned to South Korea on unaccompanied 12-month tours because South Korea is considered a combat zone. Such a change would also reverse decades of Pentagon policy for South Korea, acknowledging that the threat of an attack from the North has declined in the face of an unwavering American deterrent force and the growth of an increasingly capable South Korean military. “I don’t think anybody considers the Republic of Korea today a combat zone,” Mr. Gates told reporters here on the final day of a weeklong Asian trip, which also had stops in Guam, Singapore and Thailand. But Mr. Gates, elaborating on comments he made on Monday, noted that extending tours  and allowing families to join soldiers here would require building more housing and consideration of other financial and logistical details, suggesting that such a step was still years away. Aides to Mr. Gates said that with broad agreement to align the policy in South Korea with that in Germany and other overseas bases, the next step will be for each of the armed services to determine how to incorporate three-year tours in South Korea with other personnel duty rotations worldwide. “Our goal is to rapidly reach the point when all U.S. service members can bring their families to Korea and stay here for a normal three-year tour,” Gen. Walter L. Sharp of the Army said Tuesday. He spoke at a ceremony at Yongsan Garrison in which he assumed command of American forces on the Korean Peninsula from Gen. B. B. Bell, who is retiring. Only about 10 percent of the forces in South Korea, mostly senior officers, are authorized to have their families with them. Extending the length of tours would be another major change to the American military presence here. Over the past few years, United States troops have been moving from bases near the demilitarized zone to new posts farther south, leaving South Korean troops to take over the major responsibility along the front. Moving the American troops away from the border withNorth Korea— where they are within easy range of 12,000 artillery pieces and rocket launchers — would make them better able to absorb and respond to a North Korean offensive. The shift of American forces has the added benefit of defusing tensions with South Koreans. Many American bases built decades ago in rural areas have since been swallowed up by the sprawl of Seoul, the capital. Mr. Gates said that in a meeting on Tuesday with South Korea’s defense minister, Lee Sang-hee, he reaffirmed the realignment plan and a transition of wartime control of allied forces to a South Korean joint military command by 2012. Mr. Gates said they discussed broadening security relations beyond the Korean Peninsula to regional and global issues. The American military presence in South Korea has declined by about 9,000 troops in five years, with some of those soldiers now used  in Iraq and Afghanistan. To offset the drop in American troops, United States commanders plan to rely on a new generation of sensors, precision-guided bombs and high-speed transport ships, Pentagon officials said.

The warning, one of the harshest in years, was a response to a statement by Kim Tae-young, the head of South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff.

SEOUL,South Korea—North Koreacontinued Sunday to lash out at the new conservative government in Seoul, threatening to reduce the South to “ashes” if the South Korean government made the “slightest move” to attack. The warning, one of the harshest in years, was a response to a statement by Kim Tae-young, the head of the South’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, that his military would strike suspected North Korean nuclear weapons sites if Pyongyang attempted to attack the South with atomic bombs. North Korea typically makes incendiary statements toward the United States and South Korea when Washington and Seoul conduct joint military exercises or when the countries put pressure on the hard-line government of Kim Jong-il to change its policies. The South Korean government did not respond immediately to the warning Sunday. The North Korean statement, made by an unidentified military affairs commentator at Pyongyang’s state-run Korean Central News Agency, also reiterated the North’s threat to end all inter-Korean government contacts unless Seoul apologized for Mr. Kim’s remark, which it described as  “war mongering.” “Everything will be in ashes, not just a sea of fire, if our advanced pre-emptive strike once begins,” the commentator was quoted as saying. South Korea’s new president, Lee Myung-bak, unveiled a major shift last week from the policies of his two liberal predecessors, whose governments had provided billions of dollars of aid for the impoverished North. Mr. Lee said he would drastically curtail such aid unless Pyongyang abandoned its nuclear programs. Since Thursday, the North has expelled South Korean officials at a joint factory park in the North, test-fired a volley of missiles and threatened to scuttle a  deal it made last October to disable its nuclear facilities and give a full list of its nuclear programs in exchange for aid and diplomatic concessions. At the height of a 1993-94 crisis over the North’s efforts to build nuclear weapons, North Korea threatened to turn Seoul into “a sea of fire,” setting off  a panic in the South that prompted residents  to rush to stock up on food. But after a decade of political reconciliation with Pyongyang, South Koreans have grown less afraid of military threats from the North, and there was no sign of panic Sunday in Seoul. The South’s Defense Ministry has said that Mr. Kim’s comment last week about possible attacks on the North should not be interpreted as an intention to launch a pre-emptive strike. The North has conducted a nuclear test, but it is unclear whether the country has mastered the ability to deliver a working nuclear weapon.

North Korea is likely to miss a year-end deadline to declare all of its nuclear activities and disable its main nuclear site, the South Korean foreign minister said.

SEOUL,South Korea—North Koreais likely to miss a year-end deadline to declare all of its nuclear activities and disable its main nuclear site, the South Korean foreign minister said Thursday. The comment by the foreign minister, Song Min-soon, came a day after North Korea warned that it would slow work to disable its main nuclear complex at Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang, the capital, because of delays in deliveries of aid. Delays are a regular feature of carrying out any deal with North Korea but the latest setback will create fresh doubt about a deal  previously seen as one of the few diplomatic successes of the Bush administration. In agreements struck in February and fine-tuned in October, North Korea promised to disable its Yongbyon nuclear facilities and give a complete declaration of all its nuclear programs by the end of the year in return for fuel and other aid. “Our target date was the end of December, but we may not make it,” Mr. Song told reporters in a news conference four days before the Dec. 31 deadline. “We face hurdles both in the nuclear disablement and nuclear declaration.” The likely delay comes at a delicate time in South Korean politics. The transitional team of President-elect Lee Myung-bak, who won the Dec. 19 election with a pledge to get tough on North Korea, has begun to review his country’s policy toward the North. Last month, North Korea began disabling its sole operating nuclear reactor and two other plutonium-producing facilities at Yongbyon, under the supervision of American experts. The Bush administration, which had once designated North Korea as part of an “axis of evil” and refused to deal with it, embraced those agreements as a diplomatic breakthrough at a time when its diplomacy remained bogged down in Iran, another “axis of evil” country suspected of nuclear weapons development. On Thursday, Mr. Song said more negotiations were required to solve the dispute that set off the nuclear crisis with North Korea five years ago:  whether North Korea has tried to enrich uranium in addition to its known program of making bombs with plutonium. In 2002, the United States confronted North Korea with what it called evidence that the North Koreans were trying to build a uranium enrichment program using centrifuges made of aluminum tubes. In recent talks, however, North Korea failed to give American officials a satisfactory explanation about its uranium enrichment program. If that issue is not resolved, the United States and its allies may end up disabling North Korea’s plutonium program but may leave it with a potential alternative route to building nuclear bombs with highly enriched uranium. American suspicions about the uranium program — and the North’s denials — led to the collapse of a 1994 nuclear agreement with North Korea that froze its plutonium program. North Korea revived its plutonium program in 2002 and tested a nuclear device in October 2006. North Korea acknowledges that it imported tons of high-strength aluminum tubes from Russia, and has even provided the United States with samples, saying that they had nothing to do with uranium enrichment. But American officials reportedly found traces of uranium on those samples, though they remained unsure about their origins. Kim Sung-han, a North Korea expert at Korea University in Seoul, said, “As long as North Korea flatly denies that it has had a uranium enrichment program, there cannot be advancement toward the next steps” — the dismantling of North Korea’s nuclear facilities and the United States’ normalization of ties with North Korea. “North Korea must give an explanation the United States can accept,” he said. “There can’t be a compromise on this.” While negotiators continued haggling, Hyun Hak-pong, a vice director general at North Korea’s Foreign Ministry, said Wednesday that North Korea had “no choice but to take measures to adjust” the disablement work at Yongbyon because aid shipments promised under the October deal were not arriving fast enough, according to Japanese media reports from Pyongyang. In Washington, a State Department spokesman, Gonzalo Gallegos, said that he was not aware of any slowdown in aid and that the United States expected “further heavy fuel oil shipments and other energy assistance to move forward in the near future.” North Korea had been promised the equivalent of one million tons of heavy fuel oil in return for disabling its nuclear facilities. It has so far received 150,000 tons of oil and 5,010 tons of steel products to renovate its power plants. Mr. Kim, the Korea University professor, said North Korea’s strategy appeared to be to “minimize” its nuclear declaration and “maximize” the economic rewards it could get from the Yongbyon plant’s disablement. North Korea may also stall on the process to increase leverage against the new South Korean government, which will be inaugurated in late February, he said.

The sinking of a warship revealed that South Korea is still vulnerable to a surprise attack, U.S. officials say. 
==::==

==::==
WASHINGTON — Surprised by how easily a South Korean warship was sunk by what an international investigation concluded was a North Korean torpedo fired from a midget submarine, senior American officials say they are planning a long-term program to plug major gaps in the South’s naval defenses. They said the sinking revealed that years of spending and training had still left the country vulnerable to surprise attacks. The discovery of the weaknesses inSouth Koreacaught officials in both countries off guard. As South Korea has rocketed into the ranks of the world’s top economies, it has invested billions of dollars to bolster its defenses and to help refine one of the oldest war plans in the Pentagon’s library: a joint strategy with the United States to repel and defeat a North Korean invasion. But the shallow waters where the attack occurred are patrolled only by South Korea’s navy, and South Korean officials confirmed in interviews that the sinking of the warship, theCheonan, which killed 46 sailors, revealed a gap that the American military must help address. The United States — pledged to defend its ally but stretched thin by the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq — would be drawn into any conflict. But it has been able to reduce its forces on the Korean Peninsula by relying on South Korea’s increased military spending. Senior Pentagon officials stress that firepower sent to the region by warplanes and warships would more than compensate for the drop in American troop levels there in the event of war. But the attack was evidence, the officials say, of howNorth Koreahas compensated for the fact that it is so bankrupt that it can no longer train its troops or buy the technology needed to fight a conventional war. So it has instead invested heavily in stealthy, hard-to-detect technologies that can inflict significant damage, even if it could not win a sustained conflict. Building a small arsenal of nuclear weapons is another big element of the Northern strategy — a double-faceted deterrent allowing it to threaten a nuclear attack or to sell the technology or weapons in order to head off retaliation even for an act of war like sinking South Korean ships. In an interview last week, Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that the joint training exercise with South Korea planned just off the country’s coast in the next few weeks represented only the “near-term piece” of a larger strategy to prevent a recurrence of the kind ofshock the South experiencedas it watched one of its ships sunk without warning. But the longer-range effort will be finding ways to detect, track and counter the miniature submarines, which he called “a very difficult technical, tactical problem.” “Longer term, it is a skill set that we are going to continue to press on,” Admiral Mullen said. “Clearly, we don’t want that to happen again. We don’t want to give that option to North Korea in the future. Period. We want to take it away.” American and South Korean officials declined to describe details of the coming joint exercises, except to say that they would focus on practicing antisubmarine warfare techniques and the interdiction of cargo vessels carrying prohibited nuclear materials and banned weapons. To counter the unexpected ability of midget submarines to take on full warships, the long-term fix will mean greatly expanding South Korea’s antisubmarine network to cover vast stretches of water previously thought to be too shallow to warrant monitoring closely — with sonar and air patrols, for instance. That would include costly investment in new technologies, as well as significant time spent determining new techniques for the South Korean military. North Korea presents an adversary with a complicated mix of strengths and weaknesses, said senior American officers. According to a recent strategic assessment by the American military based on the Korean Peninsula, the North has spent its dwindling treasury to build an arsenal able to start armed provocations “with little or no warning.” These attacks would be specifically designed for “affecting economic and political stability in the region” — exactly what happened in the attack on the Cheonan, which the South Korean military and experts from five other countries determined was carried out by a North Korean midget submarine firing a powerful torpedo. Admiral Mullen and other officials said they believed the Cheonan episode might be just the first of several to come. “North Korea is predictable in one sense: that it is unpredictable in what it is going to do,” he said. “North Korea goes through these cycles. I worry a great deal that this isn’t the last thing we are going to see.” High-ranking South Korean officials acknowledge that the sinking was a shock. “As the Americans didn’t anticipate 9/11, we were not prepared for this attack,” one South Korean military official said. “While we were preoccupied with arming our military with high-tech weapons, we have not prepared ourselves against asymmetrical-weapons attack by the North.” The South Korean military was well aware that the North had submarines — around 70, according to current estimates. But the focus had been on North Korea’s using larger conventional submarines to infiltrate agents or commandos into the South, as it had in the past, not on midget submarines sophisticated enough to sink a major surface warship. “We believe that this is the beginning of North Korea’s asymmetrical military provocations employing conventional weapons,” said the South Korean official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the military’s internal analysis. “They will use such provocations to ratchet up pressure on the U.S. and South Korea. The Cheonan sinking is an underwater terrorist attack, and this is the beginning of such attacks.” Though it is considered unlikely, the threat of a conventional war with North Korea is still an issue, too, officials said. The American military’s most recent “strategic digest” assessing both the strengths of the United States-South Korea alliance and the continuing threat from the North notes that North Korea’s military is “outfitted with aging and unsophisticated equipment.” Even so, 70 percent of North Korea’s ground forces — part of the fourth-largest armed force in the world — remain staged within about 60 miles of the demilitarized zone with the South. In that arsenal are 250 long-range artillery systems able to strike the Seoul metropolitan area. “While qualitatively inferior, resource-constrained and incapable of sustained maneuver, North Korea’s military forces retain the capability to inflict lethal, catastrophic destruction,” said the assessment, approved by Gen. Walter L. Sharp, commander of American and United Nations forces in South Korea. There are about 28,500 American forces in South Korea today, significantly fewer than before the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The South Korean military has maintained its armed forces at a consistent number between 600,000 and 700,000, and has steadily modernized based on its economic dynamism. The North has an active-duty military estimated at 1.2 million, with between five million and seven million in the reserves. But many are poorly trained, or put to work building housing or seeking out opponents of Kim Jong-il’s government. The best trained, best equipped and best paid of them are North Korea’s special operations forces, numbering about 80,000 and described by the American military as “tough, well-trained and profoundly loyal.” Their mission is to infiltrate the South for intelligence gathering and for “asymmetric attacks against a range of critical civilian infrastructure and military targets.”

SEOUL, South Korea — North Korean troops fired two machine-gun bursts at a South Korean guard post across their heavily militarized border on Friday night, and soldiers from the South returned fire with three rifle shots, a Defense Ministry official said in Seoul. The official, Kiyheon Kwon, said that the fire from the North was unprovoked, and that a United Nations investigation team was being sent to the scene. The exchange took place in Hwacheon, a mountainous area about 70 miles northeast of Seoul. South Korean troops along the border were placed on the highest state of alert, Mr. Kwon said, adding that “nothing more happened” after the initial volleys. The North Korean fire came from a guard post about 1,400 yards  away, he said. Defense officials said they had no immediate explanation for the North Korean fire, which they said was the first such episode since August 2007. They said the shots had come from a 14.5-millimeter machine gun, typically used against aircraft and light armor. The North Korean military is known to use the gun, which has an effective range of 2,000 yards. North Koreawas angered by the South’s recent refusal to engage in additional rounds of open-endedmilitary talks, according to analysts in Seoul. Earlier Friday, the North’s official news agency, K.C.N.A., called the rejection of the talks“an act of treachery”that would have “a catastrophic impact.” “There was this verbal attack by the North Koreans,” said Paik Hak-soon, director of the Center for North Korean Studies at the Sejong Institute near Seoul. “The North saidSouth Koreawould get a very serious lesson from this noncooperation. “It’s too soon to know, and maybe it’s just accidental firing, but if this proves to be intentional firing, North Korea could be trying to send a signal that they are living up to their words,” he said. The exchange of fire came on the eve of a highly anticipatedreunionof families separated by the Korean War. The six-day gathering of about 100 families from both the North and the South is scheduled to begin Saturday at the North Korean resort of Diamond Mountain. There was no immediate indication Friday night that the reunions would be canceled or suspended, and the Unification Ministry in Seoul said late Friday night that the gathering would proceed as scheduled. South Korea also is preparing to host a summit meeting of leaders of the Group of 20 on Nov. 11 and 12 in Seoul. The group includes the United States, China, Russia and the European Union. Tensions have been especially strained between the Koreas since the sinking of a South Korean warship in March, for which the South has blamed a North Korean torpedo attack. The North has denied involvement in the sinking, which killed 46 sailors. But in recent weeks, the North has made diplomatic overtures that Mr. Paik characterized as “a peace offensive.” He said, “So intentional firing by North Korea, across the DMZ, it doesn’t make sense.” North Korea shuffled its senior leadership hierarchy last month, with Kim Jong-un, the youngest son of the leader, Kim Jong-il, receiving significant political posts in the Workers’ Party. “The most urgent thing for North Korea right now is their political stability,” Mr. Paik said. “They want a smooth power succession, a smooth transition. That’s their top priority, and anything that would have a negative impact on that would be avoided.”

SEOUL, South Korea — The North Korean leader,Kim Jong-il, attended a massive military parade with his youngest son and designated successor on Sunday as the ruling Communist government celebrated the 65th anniversary of the founding of its Workers’ Party. The son,Kim Jong-un, wearing a dark suit despite his recent promotion to four-star general, watched the festivities and reviewed squads of goose-stepping troops with his 68-year-old father and other senior politicians and generals. The event was held in Kim Il-sung Square, named for Kim Jong-un’s grandfather, the founder of the North Korean state. Video from the celebration in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, showed tens of thousands of performers and soldiers arrayed in what was said to be the largest such event in the country’s history. For the first time, a few dozen Western news media organizations, including some American outlets, were allowed to attend the festivities and report live from the square. The elder Mr. Kim, who is said to be in poor health after having suffered a stroke in 2008, has hurried the succession of Kim Jong-un in recent weeks. At a Workers’ Party meeting last month,Kim Jong-un was made a generaland received two significant positions in the party. Other members of the Kim family and the leader’s inner circle also received new posts and promotions as the leadership hierarchy was reshuffled to provide Kim Jong-un with mentors and supporters as he solidifies his power. Little is known about Kim Jong-un, who is believed to be 27 or 28. He is the youngest of Mr. Kim’s three sons  — the older brothers were uninterested or deemed incapable of leadership  — and he attended school for a time in Bern, Switzerland. He is known to speak some English, and he most likely speaks German as well. Until last month’s party meeting, very few pictures of him had been seen in public. The Workers’ Party anniversary is typically a major national holiday inNorth Korea, with people receiving food handouts from the government. The theme of the celebration Sunday was heavily military, befitting Kim Jong-il’s guiding philosophy of “songun,” or military first. Nuclear-armed North Korea has a huge standing army, with 1.2 million soldiers, and its border withSouth Koreais one of the world’s most heavily militarized. There was no immediate reaction from the South Korean government to Sunday’s parade in the North, but the conservative administration of PresidentLee Myung-bakhas taken a hard line against North Korea, and relations between the two countries remain strained. The South blames a North Korean torpedo attack for the sinking in March of one of its naval vessels, theCheonan, that killed 46 sailors. The North has denied any role in the sinking.

South Korea’s Red Cross offered the North an estimated $8.3 million in aid to help cope with flooding, the Yonhap news agency reported on Tuesday. Aid being offered toNorth Koreaincludes medical kits, food and other emergency supplies, Yonhap reported, citing government and Red Cross officials. The offer was being sent to North Korean officials on Tuesday. The flood aid offer comes during a period of tension on the Korean Peninsula following the sinking of a South Korean navy ship last March that claimed the lives of 46 sailors. South Korean investigators say that the warship,Cheonan, was struck by a North Korean torpedo and have demanded an apology. The North has denied involvement. The aid offer also follows the United States expanding its existing sanctions against North Korea. On Monday, Washington said it was freezing the assets of individuals and organizations suspected of trafficking in nuclear technology and bringing luxury goods into the country for its leader, Kim Jong-il. North Korea has suffered flooding in August, primarily near the city of Sinuiju in the northwest, a vital trade point between the country and China, its largest source of trade and aid. North Korea’s agricultural section has seen frequent floods and drought since the mid-1990s. The country has been vulnerable to landslides and flash floods because of lands stripped of trees for firewood.

SEOUL, South Korea — The United States andSouth KoreaannouncedTuesday that the first in a series of large-scale naval exercises off Japan and the Korean Peninsula would begin next week, despite objections from China. The exercises, they said, are meant as a show of force and a “first step” in trying to deterNorth Koreafrom acts of aggression in the region, nearly four months after the sinking of a South Korean warship for which the United States and South Korea have blamed the North. The first of the exercises, to be conducted from Sunday to Wednesday on the Sea of Japan, to the east, is to include an American aircraft carrier — the nuclear-poweredGeorge Washington, one of the largest warships in the world —  20 other ships and submarines, and 100 aircraft. It will  involve 8,000 men and women from the American and South Korean armed services. The Defense Department said that later exercises would be conducted on the Yellow Sea, which is on the western side of the Korean Peninsula and is claimed by China as a military operations zone.  Adm.Robert F. Willard, the commander of the United States Pacific Command, and American military  officials would not say whether those exercises would include the George Washington. As recently as last October, the George Washington participated in naval exercises in the Yellow Sea with South Korea. China, which has growing naval ambitions and is North Korea’s most important ally and biggest trading partner, has made clear that it objects to any foreign operations on the Yellow Sea. Most pointedly, on Tuesday, the state-run English-language newspaper China DailyannouncedChina’s own just-completed exercises there. The report said the purpose of the Chinese exercise, Warfare 2010, had been to improve defense capabilities against long-distance attacks. Four helicopters and four rescue vessels took part in the exercise on Saturday. The next day, tanks were loaded onto vessels at a port in Shandong Province. Trains were also used to transport tanks and other military equipment to ships. In a sign that China was moderating its response, the report cited military analysts saying that the drill had been a routine logistics mission and that it had little to do with the imminent exercises by the United States and South Korea, though one analyst was quoted as saying the timing was not an “entire coincidence.” The United States appeared to shrug off the Chinese drill. “I don’t think it’s a cause for any concern,” Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary, who is  traveling with Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, said Tuesday in Seoul. “We operate in international waters, and we wouldn’t preclude them from doing the same thing.” China has refused to agree with the conclusion of South Korea’s investigation into the March sinking of its warship, theCheonan, in which 46 sailors died. The investigation, conducted with the help of international experts, found that a North Korean torpedo had sunk the ship. North Korea has denied responsibility and called the report   a lie. Earlier, Admiral Willard referred to the case in dismissing Chinese objections to the joint exercises. “If I have a concern vis-à-vis China,” he said, “it is that China exert itself to influence Pyongyang so that incidents like the Cheonan don’t happen in the future.” On Wednesday morning, Mr. Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton climbed up to an observation deck in the demilitarized zone and peered through binoculars into a gloomy drizzle at North Korea in the distance. “It’s stunning how little has changed there and yet how much South Korea continues to grow and prosper,” Mr. Gates said. “The North, by contrast, stagnates in isolation and deprivation.” The exercises come at a time when China is expanding the mission of its navy and asserting its sovereignty over waters claimed by other Asian nations. Chinese admirals say the navy is prepared to go beyond its traditional role of coastal defense and engage in “far sea defense” — sending ships to waters between the Strait of Malacca, off Singapore, and the Persian Gulf to protect economic interests. The Chinese Navy is pushing operations into parts of the Pacific usually dominated by the United States Navy, and China is making bolder claims to portions of the South China Sea claimed by other Asian countries. The drumbeat of Chinese concern over the United States-South Korean exercises has been steady. In early July, People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party, reported that Gen. Ma Xiaotian, deputy chief of the general staff of the People’s Liberation Army, said that China “strongly opposed” the exercises. Last week, the online edition of People’s Daily published a detailed five-point criticism by Maj. Gen. Luo Yuan, a deputy secretary general with the army’s Academy of Military Sciences, who stressed the importance of the Yellow Sea as “a gateway to China’s capital region and a vital passage to the heartland of Beijing and Tianjin. “In history, foreign invaders repeatedly took the Yellow Sea as an entrance to enter the heartland of Beijing and Tianjin,” he said. “The drill area selected by the United States and South Korea is only 500 kilometers away from Beijing. China will be aware of the security pressure from military exercises conducted by any country in an area that is so close to China’s heartland.” General Luo quoted a saying from Mao: “We will never allow others to keep snoring beside our beds.” The United States and South Korea announced the timing of the first exercise after Mr. Gates met with Defense Minister Kim Tae-young on Tuesday. “This exercise will demonstrate the resolute will and capabilities of both the South Korean and U.S. militaries,” said Gen. Han Min-koo, chairman of South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, in a statement released by the South Korean military. “Based on our defense readiness, we will instantly retaliate against any provocation from now on and wrap up our operation at the scene of the provocation.”

South Korea is inching closer to blaming North Korea for an attack, but the South’s options in responding appear to be limited.

SEOUL, South Korea —South Korea’s defense minister on Sunday said a torpedo attack was the most likely cause for the sinking of a South Korean warship that killed at least 40 sailors last month, a statement that inched the country closer to placing blame onNorth Koreaand added urgency to the question of how the South might respond. Still, the minister did not mention the North, continuing a cautious government approach that reflects the lack of good options available to South Korea’s leaders if they decide that North Korea was responsible for what would be one of the most serious attacks since the Korean War ended in a truce. Any military retaliation could provoke a response from a country with the capacity to strike Seoul and a mercurial leader who has proved to be violent and unpredictable. A lesser response, hard-liners in the South argue, could lead North Korean leader Kim Jong-il to conclude that he could lash out again without facing consequences. The announcement on Sunday by Defense Minister Kim Tae-young appeared to fit a pattern that some analysts say shows the government is carefully building a case for a limited response — doling out information slowly enough so emotions ease before a final assignment  of blame. Mr. Kim’s statement came two days after South Korea’s president, Lee Myung-bak, met with two former presidents in what was understood in Confucian Korea as an attempt to consult elders and build consensus about how to proceed. The two former presidents, Chun Doo-hwan and Kim Young-sam, once again proved their bona fides as hard-liners on the North, speaking emotionally about past attacks by Pyongyang — including a bombing in 1983 that killed several cabinet members. Both men also expressed certainty that North Korea was behind the ship’s sinking and urged Mr. Lee to deal “resolutely” with the North. But, significantly, neither mentioned the possibility of even a limited military attack, instead recommending harsh economic punishment, including the possibility of further dismantling the “Sunshine Policy” of reaching out to the North with aid and business ventures. The meeting could provide political cover for Mr. Lee with conservatives since Mr. Chun, a former military dictator, remains one of the country’s most prominent anti-Communists. During his brutal rule, those who argued for better relations with the North were often imprisoned and sometimes tortured, as were those who wrote or read books that cast the North in anything but an intensely critical light. So far, few South Koreans have called for military retaliation if it is determined that North Korea is responsible. Even under its most virulent anti-Communist leaders, South Korea has responded to past attacks, including the 1987 downing of a South Korean airliner, with palpable anger, but little action. In at least one of those cases — the bombing that killed the cabinet members — a revenge attack was planned, but never carried out. In others, under a liberal government, leaders reacted by trying harder to nudge the North back to the negotiating table on its nuclear program. Those relatively mild responses were before the North effectively changed the calculus of retribution by forging ahead with a nuclear program, making what intelligence experts say is fuel for at least eight nuclear weapons, or possibly the bombs themselves. Although it remains unclear if the North has the ability to deliver a viable nuclear weapon, it threatened last week to use what it called its “nuclear deterrent” if it was attacked. Any tough reaction from the South now could also frighten investors and harm the  economy, which has been recovering quickly from the global financial crisis. Given the stakes, analysts have been speculating for weeks about how Mr. Lee, who came to office promising a tougher stance against the North, would respond to the warship’s sinking. Some speculated that even if he became convinced that North Korea was responsible, he would hide the evidence rather than put his country in jeopardy. North Korea, though impoverished, bristles with conventional weapons, including  missiles, rockets and artillery that could quickly ravage Seoul. Other analysts have argued that Mr. Lee was planning just the opposite — calling in international inspectors for the ongoing   examination of the ship so that he could build support for a strong multilateral reaction if the North is guilty. Such a finding, they say, could help him bolster his argument that neither the United States nor China should give the North incentives to return to long-stalled nuclear talks, especially if those negotiations are unlikely to yield real change. A determination of North Korean culpability could also help make the case for economic sanctions with teeth. History has shown that sanctions against Pyongyang cannot work unless China and other countries besides the United States join in. China has been loath to push North Korea hard, fearing a collapse in Pyongyang’s struggling leadership that could send refugees flooding over the border. Still, even Mr. Lee might be reluctant to go too far. He has been pushing for months to hold a summit meeting with Kim Jong-il and might not want to give up that chance to show that his tougher approach, after years of what he calls liberal coddling, might yield results. In the end, should it be determined that Pyongyang sank the ship, the greatest danger could be to  the “Sunshine Policy,” a legacy of the last two liberal presidents. The policy has already been faltering, with the South cutting all shipments of fertilizer and food after the North pulled out of nuclear talks and with the shutdown of a jointly operated tourist resort in the North after the North’s military killed a South Korean tourist. Any further cutbacks could leave North Korea, which continues to grapple with food shortages and crippling inflation, even more desperate — a danger in itself.

SEOUL, South Korea —North Koreasaid on Friday that it has apprehended four South Koreans, the latest in a series of detentions of foreigners whom the North has charged with illegal entry. The South Koreans illegally entered the North “recently” and were now under interrogation, the North’s state-run Korean Central News Agency said ina brief dispatch.It provided no further details. South Korean officials said they were checking the report. The reported detentions come as North Korea is resisting calls by other nations to return to multilateral talks about dismantling itsnuclear weaponsprogram. Earlier this month, North Korea releasedRobert Park, a Christian missionaryfrom the United States who illegally entered the country on Dec. 25 to urge its leader, Kim Jong-il, to shut down its camps for political prisoners. The North has yet to reveal the identity of another American it said last month that it had arrested. Neither the United States norSouth Koreahas diplomatic relations with the North.

In the Korean Demilitarized Zone, Taesung Elementary has managed to flourish, despite the nearly 2 million heavily armed troops who face off in an uneasy truce.
==::==
2009-10-27T00:00:00Z
==::==
TAESUNG FREEDOM VILLAGE, Korean demilitarized zone — Kim Han-seul, a fifth grader, has the most heavily armed crossing guard in the world. Each morning, his school bus picks him up at a bustling town outside the demilitarized zone that separates South andNorth Korea. It drives through wire fences, tank traps and military checkpoints along a road flanked by minefields. After a 50-minute drive escorted by a military jeep with a United Nations flag, the bus unloads Han-seul and a score of other students at Taesung Elementary, the only school inside the Korean demilitarized zone, a heavily armed no man’s land guarded on both sides by nearly two million troops facing off in an uneasy truce. “People say that if a war broke out, I am going to be the first to be killed,” said Han-seul, an 11-year-old with horn-rimmed glasses. “But I say, if we haven’t had another war since the Korean War in the 1950s, why would you expect a war to happen now? I don’t have a worry in the world.” Then he hurried off to join friends on a trampoline in the schoolyard. Nearby, armed South Korean soldiers stood guard behind the corners of school buildings. This two-story island of childhood innocence is the proudest part of Taesung Freedom Village, the only pocket of land inhabited by South Korean civilians inside the 2.5-mile-wide demilitarized zone. For decades, the village and its school have symbolized the uneasy peace on the border. To keep them populated,South Koreahas given the villagers  incentives for staying, exempting them from taxes and mandatory military service. Taesung is one of South Korea’s richest villages, its farmers allotted 10 times as much farmland as their average counterparts elsewhere in the country. Still, by 2007, Taesung was succumbing to the problem plaguing every other rural village in South Korea: its population was shrinking and aging as young people left for college and jobs in cities. The number of elementary school students dwindled to a mere six in 2007 from around 25 decades ago, making the school a prime target for a cost-cutting program that called for shutting down and merging rural schools depleted of students. But Taesung is no ordinary school. Its presence gives a determined look of normality to a village where few things are normal. So last year, South Korea and the United Nations Command, which oversees the southern side of the demilitarized zone, decided to bring children from outside the  zone to attend Taesung Elementary. Now the school has 30 students, the maximum allowed under an agreement between the South and the United Nations Command. Children’s paintings decorate the walls of classrooms. Everything in the school is free except for snacks. “There are 15 outside students waiting for a vacancy here,” said Joo Sung-hyun, 37, one of the school’s 18 teachers. “Our school gets special attention, and it’s better equipped and better staffed than most other schools in South Korea.” When the armistice ending the Korean War in 1953 created the demilitarized zone, the warring sides agreed to keep two villages inside it. Across the border from Taesung is the North Korean village Kijong, which stands empty today. Soon the two villages became propaganda tools, each side pouring money into its showcase model village. When South Korea erected a flagpole about 330 feet tall here in the 1980s, North Korea built a pole about 525 feet high, the world’s tallest. The North Korean flag is so big that when it rains, it has to be taken down for fear the weight of the wet flag might break the pole. Much of the South’s lavish spending went to the school. Each classroom has a large flat-screen television. The school has more computers than students. Corporate sponsors have lined up. Each year, when one or two children graduate, national media, politicians and American and South Korean generals show up with gifts. Last year, the United States military, which leads the United Nations Command here, chipped in an incentive that gave second thoughts to parents reluctant to send their children here: it began sending American soldiers twice a week to teach English. Learning English from native speakers is an obsession in South Korea. “We thank you always because you are guardians of peace,” Kim Moon-soo, governor of Gyeonggi Province, told villagers recently, dedicating another benefit for them: a 60-seat movie house. “Your presence here symbolizes peace and hope amid tension and pain of the divided nation.” (The students voted to have “Transformers” as the first movie to be screened here.) To outsiders, Taesung looks like any other quiet and well-kept farming village in South Korea. Old farmers stroll in nearly deserted alleys. Outside lie golden fields of autumn rice. But a garrison of 80 South Korean soldiers is on guard here 24 hours a day. The soldiers follow villagers when they go to the fields and escort them back at sundown. Land mines are a constant threat. If people want a pizza delivered, they must pick it up at a military checkpoint outside the demilitarized zone. There is an 11 p.m. curfew and a door-to-door head count. Visitors invited by villagers must apply with the military two weeks in advance. Once they get here, they are trailed by soldiers. “Travel is a main inconvenience,” said Bronwyn Witthoft, an English teacher from South Africa. “But there are not many people who can say they were here. So I think I am lucky.” Most villagers look bored when outsiders ask about the dangers of living here. “Look, we have lived here for generations,” said Kim Dong-hyun, 54. “We have nowhere else to go. This is our home.” Mr. Kim seemed more worried about the village’s aging population than about the North Koreans. The population has declined steadily, to 198 now from about 250 two decades ago. Still, the propaganda war here was won by the South long ago. The empty North Korean village, Kijong, is now shadowed by the rise of a modern industrial complex built by South Korea in the North Korean town of Kaesong. Years ago, North Korean commandos often infiltrated the border to attack South Korean and American soldiers.  The North also bombarded the villagers with propaganda music. “Come to the bosom of our Great General Kim Il-sung,” the North Korean loudspeakers used to say, referring to the former  North Korean president. “It’s only 5 minutes on the run and 10 minutes on foot.” The children here seem unbowed by the weight of that history, though. “I was a bit scared being so close to North Korea when I first came here,” said Lee Kyong-eun, a 12-year-old girl. “But I am not now. Why should I, with so many soldiers working as my bodyguards?”

The meetings were the first family reunions in nearly two years and offered a rare scene of reconciliation on the peninsula.

SEOUL, South Korea — After first applying for a reunion with his North Korean family more than two decades ago, Kim Ki-sung, an 82-year-old South Korean, never gave up. This month, he applied again and beat the long odds to win one of only 100 slots available for a three-day family reunion that began in a North Korean resort on Saturday. For Mr. Kim, the reunion brought some sad news. On Saturday, he learned that his wife, whom he last saw in January 1951 during the Korean War, died years ago. But he did greet his son, Jong-hyun, 63, and his daughter, Soon-ae, 61, who knelt on the floor and bowed to him. “I am sorry I didn’t take you with me when I fled,” Mr. Kim said, remembering the day he joined the flood of refugees and United Nations troops retreating to the South as Chinese troops barreled down the peninsula, turning the tide of the war. “I am sorry. What else can I say?” Shouts of joy and tearful cries filled a reunion station as 97 older South Koreans, some in wheelchairs and some assisted by relatives, hugged 228 North Korean relatives whom they last saw during the war. Three South Koreans became too ill on the eve of the reunion to make the cross-border trip by bus. The meetings were the first family reunions in nearly two years and offered a rare scene of reconciliation on the peninsula, which has recently been locked in political tension over the North’snuclear weaponsprogram. The travails of separated families symbolize the pain of the Korean political divide. Their reunions stir powerful emotions among Koreans on both sides who believe they must one day reunify into a single nation. No mail, telephone calls or e-mail exchanges are allowed between ordinary citizens from the two sides. The scenes of the reunions were described in pool reports of South Korean news media at the Diamond Mountain resort inNorth Korea’s southeast, where the event took place. The North Korean government allowed in no foreign news media. Mr. Kim’s son brought pictures of Mr. Kim’s parents and wife. He also proudly displayed five medals that he said he had received from the North Korean government, and he thanked its leader, Kim Jong-il. The  scene  reminded South Korean relatives that family reunions were as much an occasion for propaganda for the North as they were a humanitarian event for South Koreans. “We learned only a few days ago that you are still alive,” Mr. Kim’s son was quoted as saying. “We all thought you may have died during the war.” The two Koreas held their first family reunions in 1985. They were not repeated until 2000, when the two governments agreed to organize regular reunions. After 16 rounds  that brought nearly 3,400 families together, the North abruptly suspended the program in late 2007. In the South, the government selects candidates for reunions by lottery. Thousands of unsuccessful applicants have died since the program began. The North is believed to give priority to those loyal to the party and train them in what to say in the meetings. As it did in past reunions, North Korea allowed a few “special cases.” One was Lee Kwae-seok, 79, a South Korean prisoner from the war who got married in the North and was allowed to meet his brother from the South. He wept as his younger brother told him that until she died 13 years ago their mother had often consulted fortune tellers about whether her son  was still alive. Chung Dae-choon — at 95, the oldest South Korean to join the reunions — said he could now die in peace after meeting his North Korean son. But he was also saddened when he saw that his 68-year-old son  was  ill and had a badly shaking hand. For three days, the families are expected to spend most of their time under the watchful eyes of North Korean officials, but they are allowed to meet for a few hours in private. From Tuesday to Thursday, 99 North Koreans are scheduled to meet 449 South Korean relatives at the resort.

American officials claimed that international sanctions had forced the ship, which was suspected of carrying banned cargo, to turn back.

SEOUL,South Korea— A North Korean freighter suspected of carrying banned cargo was expected to return to home port, according to a South Korean defense spokesman, as American officials claimed that international sanctions had forced the ship to turn back. The 2,000-ton ship, the Kang Nam 1,left North Korea in mid-Juneand was believed to be heading for Myanmar only days after the United Nations Security Council adopteda resolutionthat forbade the North to conduct nuclear and ballistic missile tests and called for a global embargo on its trade in weapons. The United States Navy tracked the ship amid suspicions that the North was using the voyage to test Washington’s will to enforce the sanctions. Late last month, the ship turned around and began sailing homeward. On Sunday, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said the ship turned back because the United Nations sanctions prevented it from entering any port. The ship was sailing in international waters between China and the Korean Peninsula on Monday and was likely to enter North Korean waters within the day, said Won Tae-jae, a spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry. North Korea has not explained why the ship appeared to have canceled its voyage. American authorities monitored the ship but did not stop and search it — a move the North had said it would interpret as an act of war. But American authorities worked with regional governments to inspect the ship under the United Nations mandate if it entered their ports. The South Korean authorities suspect the Kang Nam 1 is carrying a cargo of rifles and rocket launchers for Myanmar, the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported on Monday, quoting an unidentified government source. If the ship indeed was carrying weapons, aborting its voyage would be seen as a victory for the latest round of sanctions. The Security Council imposed the sanctions after the North tested a nuclear weapon on May 25. In a gesture of defiance, meanwhile, North Koreafired seven ballistic missileson Saturday during the United States’ Fourth of July holiday. The South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo reported Monday that the missiles fired on Saturday included three Scud-ER missiles, which have a range of up to 620 miles and can hit Japan. The Defense Ministry here said it could not confirm the report. But South Korean officials have told reporters that the North appeared to have fired five Scuds and two Rodong missiles. Five of them plunged into the same zone in the sea between North Korea and Japan, indicating that the North was improving its firing accuracy, they said. “Some of it seems like almost attention-seeking behavior,” Mr. Biden told the ABC News program “This Week” on Sunday, referring to the North’s latest missile tests. “I don’t want to give the attention.” The North Korean cargo ship turned around because the United States has “succeeded in uniting the most important and critical countries to North Korea on a common path of further isolating North Korea,” Mr. Biden said. “There was no place they could go with certitude that they would not be, in fact, at that point boarded and searched.” Philip S. Goldberg, the American diplomat coordinating enforcement of the sanctions, visited Malaysia on Monday for talks with officials there. Unconfirmed news reports in South Korea said that American officials had found bank accounts in Malaysia used by North Korea for its illicit trading and were seeking to shut them down. The Malaysian foreign minister, Anifah Aman, could not confirm the reports but pledged that his government would work with the United States. “If they have evidence, we’ll be most willing to work together to solve this problem,” he said, according to The Associated Press. Mr. Goldberg was in Beijing last week to discuss sanctions enforcement with officials in China, the North’s largest trade partner and provider of aid.

The disclosure of the defection came on the same day that the Communist North’s military threatened to launch a pre-emptive strike at South Korea.

SEOUL — A North Korean man believed to be a soldier has defected toSouth Koreain a rare escape through the heavily armed border separating the two countries, South Korean officials said on Tuesday. The disclosure of the defection came on the same day that the Communist North’s military threatened to launch a pre-emptive strike at its capitalist neighbor, unless the Seoul government stops what it says are anti-North Korean provocations. Conservative activists in the South have recently begun to send balloons into the isolated North carrying propaganda leaflets. North Koreahas lashed out at the South since the conservative President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea took office in February, ending 10 years of liberal rule by his two predecessors. They had made economic aid and political reconciliation with the North a top priority but Mr. Lee has pledged to get tough on the North. Under him, South Korea has irked the North by openly discussing the health of its leader, Kim Jong-il, and the future of the North after his possible demise, and by announcing the arrest of an alleged Communist spy. Seoul officials have said that Mr. Kim suffered a stroke around August. North Korean officials have denied that Mr. Kim was ill. On Tuesday, the Japanese prime minister, Taro Aso, said that Mr. was likely still recovering but able to make decisions. “There’s information that it’s likely he is in hospital now,” he told a parliamentary panel, Reuters reported. “I think intelligence of various nations shares the understanding that while his condition is not very good, it is unlikely that he can’t make any decisions.” In Seoul, Kim Sung-ho, South Korea’s intelligence chief, reportedly told lawmakers in a closed-door briefing that Kim Jong-il was “not physically perfect” but had no trouble running the country. The spy agency declined to confirm its chief’s reported comment. In recent months, conservative activists in the South -- mainly North Korean defectors supported by Christian churches -- have unleashed a wave of balloons carrying leaflets into the North, where the totalitarian regime keeps its hunger-stricken people isolated from the outside world. The leaflets harshly criticize Kim Jong-il and carry news about his alleged illness, a topic considered a taboo in the North. "The puppet authorities had better bear in mind that the advanced pre-emptive strike of our own style will reduce everything opposed to the nation and reunification to debris, not just setting them on fire," the North’s official KCNA news agency quoted a military spokesman as saying. Such strident warnings are common in North Korea’s statements to the outside world. The North Korean man who defected had recently crossed the inter-Korean border and gave himself up to a South Korean military guard post, the National Intelligence Service in Seoul said. "The man is in good health," said a spokeswoman at the spy agency, who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing an agency policy. "We are investigating his background and motive. But he told us that he defected to the South because he was fed up with the North Korean regime and worried about his future after his application for a school was rejected." She gave no further details. But another government official who also spoke anonymously said the defector was believed to be an army sergeant and crossed the border on Sunday. Almost all the defectors from the North enter the South through China, and a defection through the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas is extremely rare. In the past decade, only a few North Koreans are believed to have defected through the buffer zone, which is sealed by barbed wire fences and mined fields. A North Korean military officer defected through the border in April.

The president-elect of South Korea proposed  eliminating a government agency that has long led efforts to build reconciliation with North Korea.
==::==

==::==
SEOUL,South Korea— The president-elect on Wednesday proposed eliminating a government agency that has long led efforts to build reconciliation withNorth Korea, but which he has accused of being too soft on the Communist government there. There was no immediate response from North Korea, but analysts here said it was likely to react harshly, further complicating six-nation talks on ending its nuclear weapons programs. The proposal by the president-elect,Lee Myung-bak, to abolish the Unification Ministry and have its duties taken over by the Foreign Ministry is subject to parliamentary approval. Liberal lawmakers, who dominate Parliament and take great pride in the thawing they have long pursued between the Koreas, are expected to fight to save the ministry. The Unification Ministry has represented Seoul in inter-Korean talks that have resulted in billions of dollars of South Korean aid for the North. The issue of unification should be handled consistently with foreign policies, Mr. Lee’s transition team said Wednesday in a report on his plans to streamline the government. The reorganization plans call for closing, merging or downgrading five ministries. Besides the Unification Ministry, they include the Ministries of Information and Communication, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, Science and Technology, and Gender Equality and Family. The election of Mr. Lee, a conservative, on Dec. 19 ended a decade of liberal government here. A former chief executive of Hyundai Construction and mayor of Seoul, he has vowed to run his government like an efficient business. He will be sworn in as president on Feb. 25. Signaling the ideological shift, Mr. Lee also called for abolishing government commissions that have investigated Korean collaborators during Japanese colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula in the early 20th century and human rights abuses by past South Korean military dictators — investigations that have angered the conservatives. A spokesman for the Unification Ministry declined to comment. The ministry has been the focus of criticism throughout the administrations of the departing president, Roh Moo-hyun, and his predecessor, Kim Dae-jung. The two leaders, promoting a so-called sunshine policy,  brought about profoundly closer relations with the North, but they have been faulted for pouring aid across the border without managing to end North Korean nuclear weapons programs and human rights abuses. Mr. Lee said Mr. Roh’s approach to North Korea had caused friction with the United States, a South Korean ally, and promised to work more closely with Washington in dealing with the North. While absorbing the Unification Ministry into the Foreign Ministry, which represents Seoul in international talks on ending North Korean nuclear arms programs, would reflect Mr. Lee’s new approach, it appeared at odds with his announcement on Monday that he would continue to engage the North and be willing to meet with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il. “What we see is a lack of coordination between pro-engagement forces and hard-liners within Lee’s camp,” said Cheong Seong-chang, a specialist on North Korea at the Sejong Institute.

A declaration signed Thursday by the leaders of the Koreas contained a number of specific projects that could build closer economic and security ties between the countries.

SEOUL,South Korea, Oct. 4 — Expectations for what could be achieved at the first summit meeting between the Koreas in seven years had been low. Worries that South Korea’s president,Roh Moo-hyun, a lame duck criticized for being soft on the North, would give away too much had been high. But a declaration signed Thursday by Mr. Roh and the North’s leader,Kim Jong-il, contained a number of specific projects that could build closer economic and security ties between the Koreas, experts said. The North, in turn, appeared to have made some modest, though important, concessions to the South. The more difficult step of actually carrying out the projects with the North — whose leadership, Mr. Roh said, still does not trust the South — lies ahead. But if the declaration was a confirmation of the South’s engagement with the North, a policy set in place during the first such meeting in 2000, it also laid out a road map for the next, likely conservative, administration here in Seoul after presidential elections scheduled for Dec. 19. According to the declaration, the South will build a special economic zone in Haeju, a port town in southwesternNorth Korea, and establish a joint fishing area in nearby disputed waters in the Yellow Sea. The two sides will also work to establish joint use of a nearby river and shipping routes in waters that have long been the focal point of military clashes between the Koreas, most recently in 2002. Haeju is not far from the Kaesong Industrial Complex, the economic zone already established inside the North by South Korea. Under the declaration, the South pledged to accelerate the development of Kaesong, where South Korean factories employing North Korean workers began operating in 2004. The South will also rebuild a railway connecting Kaesong with Sinuiju, a North Korean town on China’s border, as well as a highway between Kaesong and Pyongyang, the North’s capital. In addition, the South will construct a shipbuilding complex in Nampo, a town southwest of Pyongyang. “What South Korea needed to do this time was to demonstrate some practical achievements,” said Koh Il-dong, an economist at the Korea Development Institute in Seoul. “If we look at the joint declaration, it’s not that striking. Most of the ideas were ideas we had expected. But there are accomplishments.” The projects are in keeping with the South’s long-term goal of reducing the economic gap between the Koreas, a necessary step toward reunification, possibly decades from now. More immediately, though, the declaration reflected the South’s strategy of trying to gain security on the peninsula by forging economic and other ties. Under the declaration, the two sides agreed to work toward signing a formal peace treaty for the Korean War, which ended with a simple cease-fire in 1953. This point, experts said, appeared to be a concession by the North. It had long maintained that South Korea would not be involved in any peace negotiation because the signers of the 1953 armistice were North Korea, China and the United Nations force led by the United States. In addition, the North agreed to make efforts to carry out the nuclear agreement reached in February, and reaffirmed this week, as part of separate six-nation nuclear talks. Even before Mr. Roh had departed for the North on Tuesday, he had been severely criticized in South Korea for saying initially that he would not bring up the nuclear issue during the summit meeting. “These are the things that North Korea gave to South Korea,” said Choi Jin-wook, an expert on North Korea at the government-affiliated Korea Institute for National Unification here. “These are not big things, but they will allow the South Korean government to say it got something from North Korea.” He added: “Many people in South Korea were worried that the president would make some grand declaration of peace, but he did not. In that sense, it’s hard to say we are satisfied with the summit, but at least we are not dissatisfied.” For the North’s leadership, the declaration would yield the economic growth it is seeking without demanding the political change it fears. On Wednesday, in comments to his aides, Mr. Roh said that both Mr. Kim and the North’s No. 2 leader, Kim Young-nam, had reacted with “distrust and reluctance” at the mention of “reform and openness.” The declaration sought to allay the North Korean leadership’s anxieties about the side effects of economic liberalization, stating that the two Koreas would regard each other with “mutual respect and confidence irrespective of differing ideologies and systems.” Appearing visibly upbeat, Mr. Roh left Pyongyang on Thursday after a lunch given by Mr. Kim. At the luncheon, Mr. Kim, 65, who on the first day of the summit meeting was seen leaning to one side as he walked, addressed head-on speculation in South Korea that he was severely sick, dismissing stories that, he said, suggested he had “diabetes or even a heart disease.” “I make a little move, and that gets huge coverage,” Mr. Kim added. “It seems like they’re fiction writers, not journalists.”

SEOUL, April 25 — More than 400 North Korean refugees have gone on a hunger strike in a detention center in Bangkok to protest poor sanitary conditions and delays in their resettlement inSouth Korea, human rights advocates and officials said Wednesday. Also on Wednesday, three young North Koreans who had been detained in Laos for five months for illegal entry were flown to Thailand after South Korean diplomats won their release a day earlier, refugee advocates said. The refugees in Bangkok, including 100 men and 314 women who had fledNorth Koreaand entered Thailand through China, began their hunger strike Tuesday evening, said Lee Ho Taeg, secretary general of the International Campaign to Block the Repatriation of North Korean Refugees. “The hygiene is terrible in the detention center,” Mr. Lee said. “More than 300 women are packed into a facility designed to hold only 100. It has four toilets, and two or three are always broken.” The supervisor of the BangkokImmigrationDetention Center, Lt. Col. Prawit Sirithorn, was quoted by Reuters as saying of the refugees: “Nothing’s happening. Some of them might have been stressed out because of the heat.” But in Seoul, Foreign Minister Song Min-soon confirmed the hunger strike. “We are working with the Thai authorities to solve this problem smoothly,” he said at a news briefing. Mr. Lee said that by Wednesday afternoon a standoff had developed between Thai immigration officials and the refugees. The officials were threatening to send the refugees back to North Korea unless they ended their strike, and the refugees were demanding airline tickets to Seoul.

A batch of economic reports offered some hope that the economy was improving in the United States.
==::==

==::==
The major indexes rallied on Wednesday, buoyed by several economic reports that suggested improvement in the economy, including in the job market. Investors overcame lingering concerns over debt problems inthe eurozone as well as worries over tensions between North and South Korea to push stocks sharply higher before theThanksgivingholiday. The Dow Jones industrial average surged 150.91 points, or 1.37 percent, to 11,187.28. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 17.62 points, or 1.49 percent, to 1,198.35, and the Nasdaq composite index increased 48.17 points, or 1.93 percent, to 2,543.12. Bond prices sank. The price on the 10-year Treasury note dropped 1  6/32, to 97  17/32, pushing the yield up to 2.91 percent, from 2.77 percent  on Tuesday. The Labor Department said  that filings for first-time unemployment benefitsdeclined to 407,000in the week ended Saturday, down from a revised 441,000 the previous week and well below analysts’ forecasts of 435,000. The four-weekmoving average, a less volatile measure, dropped for a third week, to 436,000. Ryan Wang, the United States economist for HSBC, said the trend in lower claims was  “long enough and significant enough to really pay attention to.” “If we continue to see claims trend lower, it is a sign that we can finally see some positive progress,” he said. The market also rose after a number of reports on consumer sentiment and spending. The S.& P.’s consumer discretionary sector was up more than 2 percent, along with industrial shares. Shares of Tiffany rose $3.06, or 5.25 percent, to $61.33, after it reported a 27 percent increase in third-quarter profit. Amazon was up $9.05, or 5.38 percent, to $177.25. The dollar rose slightly against a range of currencies, including the euro, which was at $1.3317. The economic data led to hopes that the American economy was coming out of a soft patch, said Philip J. Orlando,  chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors. “The market seemed like it kicked into another gear,” he said. Analysts said there were indications that consumer sentiment was picking up. The Commerce Department saidpersonal incomerose 0.5 percent in October, while spending was up 0.4 percent. The savings rate rose to 5.7 percent in October, from 5.6 percent in September, in line with expectations. “Rising savings and rising consumption spending are constructive signs,” Steven Ricchiuto, chief United States economist for Mizuho Securities, said in a research note. In addition, the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index on consumer sentiment rose to 71.6 this month, from 67.7 the previous month. But reasons for concern remain. The survey showed consumers remained anxious about the job market. Mr. Wang said a further decline in claims below the 400,000 mark could be a sign that job growth was accelerating toward the pace needed to meet new Federal Reserve forecasts. On the downside, a report for orders ofdurable goodscame in below expectations. Orders for durable goods, which are products meant to last more than three years, like washing machines and office equipment, decreased $6.8 billion, or  3.3 percent, to $196 billion in October. In another closely watched sector, housing sales slipped in October. According to government figures for October, new-home salesshowed a declineof 8.1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 283,000, compared with 308,000 in September. The October rate fell below expectations by analysts of 312,000. Median home prices were at their lowest levels since October 2003, falling to $194,900, from $226,300 in September. “The sales numbers should improve starting in early 2011 because the economy is starting to generate new jobs,” said Patrick Newport, the United States economist for IHS Global Insight. Markets are closed on Thursday for Thanksgiving and reopen on Friday.

The North Korean fishing boat retreated to its side of the sea border after the shots, the Ministry of Defense in Seoul said.

SEOUL, South Korea — The South Korean Navy fired warning shots at a North Korean fishing boat on Wednesday after the vessel strayed across the two Koreas’ border on the Yellow Sea, the Defense Ministry said. The North Korean boat then retreated to the northern side of the line, the ministry said. The countries have had violent exchanges before along their disputed maritime border. A South Korean naval vessel sank there in March, and 46 sailors died. The episode on Wednesday came a week before the opening of the Group of 20 economicsummit meeting, which is scheduled for Nov. 11 and 12 in Seoul. President Lee Myung-bak did not mention the episode at a televised press conference, although he said the government had extensive security procedures in place for the Group of 20 meeting. “RegardingNorth Korea, I believe they will be responsible during the Seoul summit,” Mr. Lee said. “We don’t envisage North Korea engaging in any inappropriate activities.” North Korean border guardsfired three machine-gun burstsat a South Korean guard post last Friday, and South Korean troops returned fire with three rifle shots, the Defense Ministry said last week. The gunfire from the North appeared to be accidental, a senior government official said in Seoul, but a United Nations team was investigating. In August, North Koreafired 110 artillery roundsnear two South Korean islands close to the sea border, the Office of Joint Chiefs of Staff in Seoul said then. The waters along the western border were the site of three significant naval skirmishes between the Koreas — in 1999, 2002 and November 2009. In March, the South Korean naval vessel, theCheonan,sank in western waters. The South has blamed a North Korean torpedo attack for the sinking. The North has denied any involvement.

WASHINGTON — Defense SecretaryRobert M. Gatesand his South Korean counterpart on Friday reaffirmed the close partnership of the two nations, even as they warned of potential instability asNorth Koreamoves opaquely toward a transition of power atop its dictatorial government. “The close cooperation across the whole of our two governments sends a clear message to North Korea that its provocation and aggression will not be tolerated,” Mr. Gates said during a news conference with the South Korean defense minister, Kim Tae-young. Mr. Kim, speaking through a translator, said his nation was preparing for the uncertainties of the approaching day when, it has been widely predicted, North Korea’s supreme leader,Kim Jong-il, will turn over authority to his youngest son,Kim Jong-un. “When Kim Jong-il’s health may deteriorate, or if there is a movement of public opinion in North Korea, we cannot eliminate the possibility of there being an instability situation in North Korea,” the South Korean defense minister said. Without offering details, he said the alliance between the United States andSouth Koreawould “prepare for all possible contingencies in North Korea.”
