If a company gets big enough, a modest profit of 4 percent could easily be more than the 25 times multiple, but the owner probably can't take most of that money out without strangling the business. In fact, the owner has to pay taxes on that money even if it is all left in the company.

Some employers gouge employees regardless of whether they are profitable, not profitable, or something in between. It has nothing to do with a 25 times multiple.

It's also correct that providing exact freight charges online is extremely difficult without overcharging for freight so we error on the lower side. Congress may lose their courage, if they ever had any, and give in to Amazon by enacting internet sales taxes. If they do, charging freight separately will lower the cost to our customers because tax will be charged on a lower base price. We're currently struggling with building a freight model that will provide more accurate freight charges, including LTL, based on breaking even on freight.

We work with big-ticket furniture and are wrestling with some of the same dynamics. <br/><br/>Here is a different approach.  Don't think about delivery as free vs. paid. Rather consider cost basis, flat-rate and/or fixed price.  As an internet business, do you want to be location specific or not? Your customers donâ€™t care where you are located, they just want the merchandise. If you want to operate as an internet business and be broadly available in the US market, you might consider going with flat rate delivery priced against your average delivery cost from your market. Predictable, easy to understand, flat rate. <br/><br/>A more sophisticated follow-up step would be to test the flat rate price.

I don't know about the Zanders themselves but the company is known among knitters for being knowledgeable and friendly to knitters.

They are known for having a very large range of yarn, just about every top brand, much more than a typical store.  Their prices are very good.  They have things other stores don't have, such as ""onesies,"" which are sort of like yarn seconds.

Sure, if her mother was frantic enough that Dylan wouldn't be believed. Is it possible she wasn't sexually abused at all and wrote the letter Kristof published, with or without help? Sure.

If the answer to that isn't comforting after most of a century of nuclear power, prudence indicates improving that answer before multiplying the amount of waste by a large factor.<br/><br/>On cost, they omitted entirely the percentage of capital and operating cost resulting from fossil fuel use.  The very brief claims about greenness address this obliquely.  The way to test these claims is to impose a sensible cost for fossil fuel externalities, and see what it does to our experience with nuclear power costs.  Unfortunately, the prospects for that are dim.  Without that, we risk gargantuan investments in nuclear plants that cannot continue to be built and maintained without the fossil fuels they are supposed to be replacing.  (Whoever rushes to scoff at that should try to build a gigawatt plant today with next to no input from fossil fuels.  Nuff said.)

The large and inflexible plants that we relied on for baseload power are going to be challenged by either having to operate at a loss when prices are below costs or having to operate plants in a way that shortens their life and drives up maintenance costs.

One missing voice in the American coverage of Pete's death is his sister Peggy, still alive and kicking, an American folk singer and left-wing personality in her own right. Peggy provided her own short statement on the death of her brother, which you can read in todayâ€™s Guardian here.<br /><br />http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/29/peggy-seeger-tribute-pete-seeger<br /><br />Peggy married Ewan McColl, another radical folk singer, only British. Peggy and Ewan made their lives in Britain, were not blacklisted, and indeed performed on the BBC throughout the late fifties and early sixties. The best known song from Peggy would probably be Ewan's ""The First Time Ever I saw Your Face,"" a haunting love song. If you have never heard this song, seek it out, especially if you can find one of Peggyâ€™s recordings. Her voice has its own special quality, much like her brotherâ€™s. Not classically- or pitch-perfect, but beautiful nevertheless and perfect for folk music, which after all is meant to be accessible and participatory.<br /><br />One interesting question is, ""How come Pete was blacklisted in the US and Peggy wasn't in the UK?"" The full answer to that, which might take several weeks of useful historical, cultural, and philosophical unpacking, takes you to the heart of seemingly slight, but often deep-running differences between the US and UK political economies. The British, to their credit, have mostly avoided what historian Richard J. Hofstadter famously called, in a eponymous Harperâ€™s article, â€œThe Paranoid Style in American Politics.â€ù And for good reason.<br /><br />Once we get over the loss of Pete, we might fruitfully consider both the blacklisting episode in his life, and McCarthyism in general, and compare the popular politics of that that period to that of today, particular in the 112th Congress. There are a lot of lessons to be learned. One might be that name-calling and blacklisting are the politics of the playground and the high school clique, and one might easily live to regret participation in either. Except for the discordance, such things might be to the politics of a democracy what classical standards of perfect pitch are to music, barriers to accessibility and participation. Those who are not excluded by the name-calling are put off by the ugly tone.<br /><br />Luckily for us, Mr Seeger survived to sing us into the twenty-first century, while Senator McCarthy did not.<br /><br />Hatred will get you every time.

I made the same point in 2012, when I noted that my organization had worked to challenge big tobacco and is now working with partners around the world to keep coal in the ground (Saying No to Coal:http://www.elaw.org/system/files/Autumn.2012.pdf). <br />As corporations work with governments to export their toxic products, the Environmental Law Alliance Worldwide (www.elaw.org) works with grassroots public interest lawyers to share the legal and scientific lessons of U.S. battles against those products. We are making progress evening the odds in David and Goliath battles with Big Carbon in India and the Philippines:<br /><br />In India, our partners are working in four states to keep coal in the ground and challenge coal-fired power plants in Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu. The following is one example.<br /><br />In 2012, we helped partners in India win a victory in India's National Green Tribunal stopping a proposed coal mine (the Gare VI coal mine) in Chhattisgargh. This case exposed that at a 2008 public hearing, police used batons to beat community members who came to the meeting to voice opposition to the coal mine. <br />The National Green Tribunal allowed the coal mining company to reapply for the projectâ€™s approval only if it submitted a new Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and followed strict safeguards to allow full participation at the public hearing. In 2013, the mining company did so, and we helped partners in India submit a detailed critique of the new EIA, highlighting the many local problems coal mining would cause.<br /><br />In December 2013, something remarkable happened: the governmentâ€™s Expert Appraisal Committee, which usually rubber-stamps EIAs, refused to recommend approval of the new EIA for the Gare VI coal mine. Instead, it required the mining company to submit â€œ'a detailed reply along with action plan and the budgetary provision for addressing the issues of massive increase in traffic, impacts on Kelo River, the impact of decrease of ground water, impact on climate change and the backfilling by thermal power plant fly ash.â€ù We helped our partners raise many of these issues during the public comment period. <br />The company has now submitted the required additional documents and we helped our partners analyze those documents, including the deficiencies of the company's audacious plan to extend the open pit coal mine to within 10 feet of the flood-prone Kelo River. The case is pending.<br /><br />In the Philippines, we are working to challenge a proposed coal-fired power plant. Last month, we provided assistance to partners in Mindanao to show that the Department of Environment and Natural Resources was negligent in issuing an Environmental Compliance Certificate for the proposed Southern Mindanao 200 MW coal-fired power plant along Sarangani Bay, home to valuable coral reefs. <br />In 2011, a cargo vessel carrying 65,000 tons of coal to another power plant grounded on these reefs, causing extensive damage. Along with the other impacts of coal-fired power plants, approval of an additional power plant in Sarangani Bay would further imperil the areaâ€™s coral reefs. <br />Our partners are now preparing a Writ of Continuing Mandamus.<br /><br />Please let me know if I can send additional information.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Bern Johnson<br />Executive Director<br />Environmental Law Alliance Worldwide<br />http://www.elaw.org",4,11126078,0.4162,0.2403,0.1371,0.0863,0.0931,0.0525158539,"PluviAl: ""see what is happening to Australia"" The government's stance on climate change, that it's a money con on the poor, is very popular.

The easiest take away is that renewables grab market share from nuclear even if nuclear subsidies continue and renewable subsidies don't.  <br/><br/>But, EPA regulation of stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions would dramatically change the EIA reference case.  And policy of that sort is needed to meet President Obama's commitments on emissions reductions.

This evidence for human influence has grown since AR4. It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant case of observed warming since the mid-20th century"".    Here the use of ""Human influence"" changes the AR4. There are several factors under human influence in addition to anthropogenic greenhouse gases effect.  Under B-4: it states ""The rate ofsea level rise since the mid-19th Century"" , which means sea level rise is not after 1950s but it is part of 19th century. E-1: warming will continue to exhibit interannual-to-decadal variability and will not be regionally uniform"". It is what we were telling and natural variability is a part of global temperature. B-1: talks of Northern Hemisphere but not Southern Hemisphere. At B-3, it states that ""Greenland and Antarctica"" but at E-5 it states ""Arctic sea ice"".  On global water cycle -- on monsoons is all false statements.  In place of global uniform warming, IPCC is talking regional warming contribution"".  All are hypothetical.

But we are also trying to stop, or at least reduce, that destruction in the first place. We want the government to place limits on the use of Monsantoâ€™s weed killer, Roundup, and other glyphosate products. We filed a petition with the EPA asking for an urgent review of glyphosate rules. Since Monsanto introduced Roundup Ready corn and soybeans in the late 1990s, GM crops have become nearly ubiquitous on Midwest farms and glyphosate use has soared ten-fold. It is no coincidence that the monarchsâ€™ decline began soon after Monsantoâ€™s GM crops arrived. The NRDC petition asks EPA to consider requiring that farmers set up glyphosate-free safety zones near their fields, to let milkweed grow, and banning glyphosate along highways and rights of way. NRDC is urging EPA not to limit its review to glyphosate. After years of being drenched with glyphosate, some weeds are, not surprisingly, becoming resistant to it. Big Ag is readying GM crops resistant to 2,4-D, the Agent Orange ingredient, and other herbicides. If approved to replace Roundup technology, these uses would be just as effective at wiping out milkweed, and perhaps even more toxic.

It's cheap but abysmal. And it's a shame as chicken can provide a vast variety of meats. From year old roosters that run about all day, you can get deep, red meat that if you close your eyes and eat it, you would think you were eating mild goat meat. Different breeds of hens produce different flavors. There is a wealth of chicken varieties that you can never find in a supermarket. A fantastic variety of egg colors from rose tinted ones to chocolate ones to light orange to green and blue shelled eggs. 99% of the public has no idea of this bounty.

Italians eat their pizza by fork so that it can cool for a moment and not cause that burn. Many of them prefer the coppetta (little cup) and paddle-like spoon for their gelato so that they stay clean and don't get gelato burn. Put another way: Italians savor their food.

We need to revive the economy and create good jobs now so that we can definitively  break free of the Great Recession. This is basic economics (and has been so well explained in this paper by Professor Krugman): When households cannot spend more because they have too much debt and insufficient income, then businesses don't invest or hire, and a self-reinforcing cycle begins. Only government spending can reverse the self-destructive cycle and replace it with a virtuous cycle: The government spending creates jobs, and these new workers spend their money to buy goods and services; the government spending is also used to buy many goods and services. Many businesses gladly find that they again have orders to fill. They start hiring and investing, and these new employees in the private sector start spending. A self-reinforcing recovery begins, going from strength to strength. Only then should we address our public debt and yearly deficits.<br/><br/>Thus I favor ambitious infrastructure programs now: We can repair the ruins and install world-class systems and platforms in order to revive our economy.

In a collision between the right of a woman to control her own health and body versus the rights of a fetus - a potential life in being - ones fundamental rights will be put at risk.

Much of your interpretation comes from a misunderstanding of the word ""offre"", supply in english, which has two different meanings in France. The first meaning is the same as in english, the supply of Say's Law which has been debunked. The other one, usually used by the press which is desperately bad in economics, means ""business friendly"". <br/><br/>So you could have a stimulus package aimed at increasing aggregate demand, encompassing big tax cuts to small businesses, be described by the frenc press as a supply-side policy. I know it's a bit absurd. <br/><br/>So in a way, Hollande's anouncement is a change of course not towards more austerity but away from austerity, which has been so far conducted via tax increases. Hollande promised not to reduce structural deficit more than what has alrealdy been voted for. <br/><br/>Moreover, in the particular context of the euro, when you have decided that you will not leave the euro and all of your partners put deflationnary policies in place, the next logical step is to follow the same road. Prisoner's dilemna which shows that Europe's economic policy has failed. <br/><br/>But in no way can it be described, as you say, as embracing Say's law...<br/><br/>(please note that I'm not a big fan of Hollande's policies.

You are right that the politicians here in the EU say all the wrong things, but That is what politicians do for a living. Your comments that the Euro is a straight jacket is is no better.<br/><br/>What is odd is that almost all consumer prices for food and necessities here have risen by 40% over the last 6 years. Corporations are raking it in and one can see stock prices have soared. But with P/E levels now around 18 when the average since 1928 has been only 16, there is no more room for cost-cutting. If corporations do not hire, then governments must. But many of the EUs government assets have been grabbed at bargain prices by corporations during this austerity madness. You are waving your finger in the wrong direction.<br/><br/>The European politicians are at the mercy of the international capital markets industry (who created the crisis to start then downgraded the EUs borrowing abilities) and multinational corporations (who juggle their profits around to avoid taxation and have used the crisis to downsize their workforces to great profit).

The end result is money that is spent, with little to show for it.  Just saying words like mine, dam, highway, heavy industry, brings widespread derision.

For all the talk of how the economic rules have changed, everything we have been seeing here and in other countries disproves it.  Water doesn't flow uphill unless it's pushed.  Consumer based economies cannot recover when jobs, which pay people decent wages, are not being created because no money to spend means no one buys and supplies remain on the shelves.  Companies can create a demand for things like iPods, Cabbage Patch Dolls, Tickle Me Elmo, a new wine from Argentina but the demand will last only as long as consumers want the product.  Once the demand is gone a surplus may linger long past the expiration date of the desire.  As I understand it the idea is to try and keep demand and supply in balance for as long as the product is desired by the consumers and it's profitable to produce.  <br/><br/>Perhaps Mr. Hollande needs to go and visit a flea market in France and watch what happens when a vendor is trying to sell what no one wants.  The same could be said of some of our politicians who seem to lack all understanding of the effects prolonged unemployment has on the economy, families, and morale.  One could argue that the supply Hollande thinks creates a demand is outrage and by that I am referring to the outrage we are all feeling as we watch our politicians demand from us what they themselves refuse to do:  have common sense when it comes to the economy, unemployment, etc.",36,10972613,0.2667,0.1926,0.2407,0.1481,0.0444,0.033313747,"I was fortunate to be doing business in Europe (France/England/Belgium) in 2001 when the euro became available as a trading currency, but the national monetary notes of the respective nations were still in use by the populace.  Had it been possible to continue this arrangement, the fate of individual nations would not have been so directly tied in to all others. There might even have been flexibility in dealing with deficits and the recession. As it was, the Euro not only helped to bring on the financial crisis, it made it more difficult to deal with it. Has anyone proposed a return to a dual currency model, one for trading and one for internal use?<br/><br/>Having been in Europe a bit at the birth of the Euro, I have never understood why it was seen as advantageous, other than as a step toward a unified, European govt., something that surely no one talks of now. Previously, weaker nations could sell their goods and services to richer ones at deflated prices, because their currencies traded at lower values. The only way an Italian manufacturer can sell for lower prices now is to cheat himself. <br/><br/>As for the ""supply creates demand"" idea, what a joke. We have four major grocery stores within half a mile of my house. If we get a fifth one, does demand go up?
