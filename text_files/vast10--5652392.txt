DimStiller: Workflows for dimensional analysis and reduction.

DimStiller is a system for dimensionality reduction and analysis. It
frames the task of understanding and transforming input dimensions
as a series of analysis steps where users transform data tables by
chaining together different techniques, called operators, into
pipelines of expressions. The individual operators have controls
and views that are linked together based on the structure of the
expression. Users interact with the operator controls to tune
parameter choices, with immediate visual feedback guiding the
exploration of local neighborhoods of the space of possible data
tables. DimStiller also provides global guidance for navigating
data-table space through expression templates called workflows,
which permit re-use of common patterns of analysis.
