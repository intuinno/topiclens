Visualisation for functional design.

We present two novel visualisation tools: the Influence
Explorer and the Prosection Matrix. These were specifically created to
support engineering artifact design and similar tasks in which a set of
parameter values must be chosen to lead to acceptable artifact
performance. These tools combine two concepts. One is the interactive
and virtually immediate responsive display of data in a manner conducive
to the acquisition of insight. The other, involving the precalculation
of samples of artifact performance, facilitates smooth exploration and
optimisation leading to a design decision. The anticipated benefits of
these visualisation tools are illustrated by an example taken from
electronic circuit design, in which full account must be taken of the
uncertainties in parameter values arising from inevitable variations in
the manufacturing process.
