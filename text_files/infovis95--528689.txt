Research report. Interacting with huge hierarchies: beyond cone trees.

The paper describes an implementation of a tool for
visualizing and interacting with huge information hierarchies, and some
preliminary empirical evaluation of the tool's efficacy. Existing
systems for visualizing huge hierarchies using cone trees "break down"
once the hierarchy to be displayed exceeds roughly 1000 nodes, due to
increasing visual clutter. The paper describes a system called fsviz
which visualizes arbitrarily large hierarchies while retaining user
control. This is accomplished by augmenting cone trees with several
graphical and interaction techniques: usage-based filtering, animated
zooming, hand-coupled rotation, fish-eye zooming, coalescing of distant
nodes, texturing, effective use of colour for depth cueing, and the
applications of dynamic queries. The fsviz system also improves upon
earlier cone tree visualization systems through a more elaborate node
layout algorithm. This algorithm enhances the usefulness of cone tree
visualization for large hierarchies by all but eliminating clutter.
