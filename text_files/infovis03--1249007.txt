Design choices when architecting visualizations.

In this paper, we focus on some of the key design decisions we
faced during the process of architecting a visualization system and
present some possible choices, with their associated advantages and
disadvantages. We frame this discussion within the context of Rivet, our
general visualization environment designed for rapidly prototyping
interactive, exploratory visualization tools for analysis. As we
designed increasingly sophisticated visualizations, we needed to refine
Rivet in order to be able to create these richer displays for larger and
more complex data sets. The design decisions we discuss in this paper
include: the internal data model, data access, semantic meta-data
information the visualization can use to create effective visual
decodings, the need for data transformations in a visualization tool,
modular objects for flexibility, and the tradeoff between simplicity and
expressiveness when providing methods for creating
visualizations.
