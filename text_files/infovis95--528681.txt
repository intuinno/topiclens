Towards a generative theory of diagram design.

We describe the theoretical background for AVE, an automatic
visualization engine for semantic networks. We have a functional notion
of aesthetics and therefore understand meaningfulness as a central issue
for information visualization. This implies that the diagrams should
communicate the characteristics of the data as effectively as possible.
In this generative theory of diagram design, we include data
characterization, systematic use of graphical means of expression and
the combination of graphical means of expression. After giving a brief
introduction and an application scenario we discuss these aspects in
detail. Finally, a process model of an automatic visualization process
is sketched and directions for further research are outlined.
