Visualizing a tennis match.

This paper describes our work on visualizing the information
of a tennis match. We use competition trees to organize the information
of a tennis match and visualize the competition trees by the top-nesting
layered maps with translucent colored layers. We create iconic
representations to describe the detailed information of athletic events
in an intuitive manner. Specialized views of the information are
displayed by applying multiple Magic Lens filters on the top-nesting
layered maps. The dynamic nature of the tennis match is depicted by the
time-varying display. The approach we present in this paper can be used
to visualize other sports information, information with competition
property, or information with hierarchical structure
