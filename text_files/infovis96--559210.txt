Visage: a user interface environment for exploring information.

Visage is a prototype user interface environment for exploring
and analyzing information. It represents an approach to coordinating
multiple visualizations, analysis and presentation tools in
data-intensive domains. Visage is based on an information-centric
approach to user interface design which strives to eliminate impediments
to direct user access to information objects across applications and
visualizations. Visage consists of a set of data manipulation
operations, an intelligent system for generating a wide variety of data
visualizations (SAGE) and a briefing tool that supports the conversion
of visual displays used during exploration into interactive presentation
slides. This paper presents the user interface components and styles of
interaction that are central to Visage's information-centric approach
