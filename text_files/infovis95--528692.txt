Case study. Visualising cyberspace: information visualisation in the Harmony Internet browser.

The explosive growth of information systems on the Internet
has clearly demonstrated the need to organise, filter, and present
information in ways which allow users to cope with the sheer quantities
of information available. The scope for visualisation of Gopher and WWW
spaces is restricted by the limitations of their respective data models.
The far richer data model supported by the Hyper-G Internet information
system is exploited by its Harmony client to provide a number of
tightly-coupled, two- and three-dimensional visualisation and
navigational facilities, which help provide location feedback and
alleviate user disorientation.
