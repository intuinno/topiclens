MassVis: Visual analysis of protein complexes using mass spectrometry.

Protein complexes are formed when two or more proteins
non-covalently interact to form a larger three dimensional structure
with specific biological function. Understanding the composition of such
complexes is vital to understanding cell biology at the molecular level.
MassVis is a visual analysis tool designed to assist the interpretation
of data from a new workflow for detecting the composition of such
protein complexes in biological samples. The data generated by the
laboratory workflow naturally lends itself to a scatter plot
visualization. However, characteristics of this data give rise to some
unique aspects not typical of a standard scatter plot. We are able to
take the output from tandem mass spectrometry and render the data in
such a way that it mimics more traditional two-dimensional gel
techniques and at the same time reveals the correlated behavior
indicative of protein complexes. By computationally measuring these
correlated patterns in the data, membership in putative complexes can be
inferred. User interactions are provided to support both an interactive
discovery mode as well as an unsupervised clustering of likely
complexes. The specific analysis tasks led us to design a unique
arrangement of item selection and coordinated detail views in order to
simultaneously view different aspects of the selected item.
