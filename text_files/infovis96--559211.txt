Data characterization for automatically visualizing heterogeneous information.

Automated graphical generation systems should be able to
design effective presentations for heterogeneous (quantitative and
qualitative) information in static or interactive environments. When
building such a system, it is important to thoroughly understand the
presentation-related characteristics of domain-specific information. We
define a data-analysis taxonomy that can be used to characterize
heterogeneous information. In addition to capturing the
presentation-related properties of data, our characterization takes into
account the user's information-seeking goals and visual-interpretation
preferences. We use automatically-generated examples from two different
application domains to demonstrate the coverage of the proposed taxonomy
and its utility for selecting effective graphical techniques
