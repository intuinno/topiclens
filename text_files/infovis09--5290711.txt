Temporal Summaries: Supporting Temporal Categorical Searching, Aggregation and Comparison.

When analyzing thousands of event histories, analysts often
want to see the events as an aggregate to detect insights and generate
new hypotheses about the data. An analysis tool must emphasize both the
prevalence and the temporal ordering of these events. Additionally, the
analysis tool must also support flexible comparisons to allow analysts
to gather visual evidence. In a previous work, we introduced align,
rank, and filter (ARF) to accentuate temporal ordering. In this paper,
we present temporal summaries, an interactive visualization technique
that highlights the prevalence of event occurrences. Temporal summaries
dynamically aggregate events in multiple granularities (year, month,
week, day, hour, etc.) for the purpose of spotting trends over time and
comparing several groups of records. They provide affordances for
analysts to perform temporal range filters. We demonstrate the
applicability of this approach in two extensive case studies with
analysts who applied temporal summaries to search, filter, and look for
patterns in electronic health records and academic records.
