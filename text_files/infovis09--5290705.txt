Scattering Points in Parallel Coordinates.

In this paper, we present a novel parallel coordinates design
integrated with points (scattering points in parallel coordinates,
SPPC), by taking advantage of both parallel coordinates and
scatterplots. Different from most multiple views visualization
frameworks involving parallel coordinates where each visualization type
occupies an individual window, we convert two selected neighboring
coordinate axes into a scatterplot directly. Multidimensional scaling is
adopted to allow converting multiple axes into a single subplot. The
transition between two visual types is designed in a seamless way. In
our work, a series of interaction tools has been developed. Uniform
brushing functionality is implemented to allow the user to perform data
selection on both points and parallel coordinate polylines without
explicitly switching tools. A GPU accelerated dimensional incremental
multidimensional scaling (DIMDS) has been developed to significantly
improve the system performance. Our case study shows that our scheme is
more efficient than traditional multi-view methods in performing visual
analysis tasks.
