BiblioMapper: a cluster-based information visualization technique .

        The purpose of the paper is to develop a visualization system
of a document space, called BiblioMapper, for CISI collections, one of
the bibliographic databases available on the Internet. The major
function of BiblioMapper is to visualize the document space with a
cluster-based visualization technique. The cluster-based visualization
technique assembles a set of documents according to semantic
similarities. One advantage of this technique is that users are able to
focus on and assess each cluster and the documents which the cluster
comprises according to their information needs
