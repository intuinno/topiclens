Managing software with new visual representations.

Managing large projects is a very challenging task requiring
the tracking and scheduling of many resources. Although new technologies
have made it possible to automatically collect data on project
resources, it is very difficult to access this data because of its size
and lack of structure. We present three novel glyphs for simplifying
this process and apply them to visualizing statistics from a
multi-million line software project. These glyphs address four important
needs in project management: viewing time dependent data; managing large
data volumes; dealing with diverse data types; and correspondence of
data to real-world concepts.
