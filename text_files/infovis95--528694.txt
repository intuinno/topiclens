Case study. A WWW viewpoint on scientific visualization: an EPA case study for technology transfer.

The paper examines how to provide scientific visualization
capabilities to environmental scientists, policy analysts and decision
makers with personal computers (PCs) on their desktops. An approach for
using the World Wide Web (WWW) for disseminating knowledge on scientific
visualization and for intelligent access to visualization capabilities
on high performance (UNIX) workstations is outlined.
