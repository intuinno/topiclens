SellTrend: Inter-Attribute Visual Analysis of Temporal Transaction Data.

We present a case study of our experience designing SellTrend,
a visualization system for analyzing airline travel purchase requests.
The relevant transaction data can be characterized as multi-variate
temporal and categorical event sequences, and the chief problem
addressed is how to help company analysts identify complex combinations
of transaction attributes that contribute to failed purchase requests.
SellTrend combines a diverse set of techniques ranging from time series
visualization to faceted browsing and historical trend analysis in order
to help analysts make sense of the data. We believe that the combination
of views and interaction capabilities in SellTrend provides an
innovative approach to this problem and to other similar types of
multivariate, temporally driven transaction data analysis. Initial
feedback from company analysts confirms the utility and benefits of the
system.
