An operator interaction framework for visualization systems.

        Information visualization encounters a wide variety of
different data domains. The visualization community has developed
representation methods and interactive techniques. As a community, we
have realized that the requirements in each domain are often
dramatically different. In order to easily apply existing methods,
researchers have developed a semiology of graphic representations. We
have extended this research into a framework that includes operators and
interactions in visualization systems, such as a visualization
spreadsheet. We discuss properties of this framework and use it to
characterize operations spanning a variety of different visualization
techniques. The framework developed in the paper enables a new way of
exploring and evaluating the design space of visualization operators,
and helps end users in their analysis tasks
