Nonlinear magnification fields.

We introduce nonlinear magnification fields as an abstract
representation of nonlinear magnification, providing methods for
converting transformation routines to magnification fields and
vice-versa. This new representation provides ease of manipulation and
power of expression. By removing the restrictions of explicit foci and
allowing precise specification of magnification values, we can achieve
magnification effects which were not previously possible. Of particular
interest are techniques we introduce for expressing complex and subtle
magnification effects through magnification brushing, and allowing
intrinsic properties of the data being visualized to create data-driven
magnifications.
