Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data.

Data visualization is regularly promoted for its ability to reveal
stories within data, yet these ?œdata stories?? differ in important ways
from traditional forms of storytelling. Storytellers, especially
online journalists, have increasingly been integrating visualizations
into their narratives, in some cases allowing the visualization to
function in place of a written story. In this paper, we systematically
review the design space of this emerging class of
visualizations. Drawing on case studies from news media to
visualization research, we identify distinct genres of narrative
visualization. We characterize these design differences, together with
interactivity and messaging, in terms of the balance between the
narrative flow intended by the author (imposed by graphical elements
and the interface) and story discovery on the part of the reader
(often through interactive exploration). Our framework suggests design
strategies for narrative visualization, including promising
under-explored approaches to journalistic storytelling and educational
media.
