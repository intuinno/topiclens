What's being said near ?Martha?? Exploring name entities in literary text collections.

A common task in literary analysis is to study characters in a
novel or collection. Automatic entity extraction, text analysis and
effective user interfaces facilitate character analysis. Using our
interface, called POSvis, the scholar uses word clouds and
self-organizing graphs to review vocabulary, to filter by part of
speech, and to explore the network of characters located near characters
under review. Further, visualizations show word usages within an
analysis window (i.e. a book chapter), which can be compared with a
reference window (i.e. the whole book). We describe the interface and
report on an early case study with a humanities scholar.
