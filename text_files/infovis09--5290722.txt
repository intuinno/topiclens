Participatory Visualization with Wordle.

We discuss the design and usage of ldquoWordle,rdquo a
Web-based tool for visualizing text. Wordle creates tag-cloud-like
displays that give careful attention to typography, color, and
composition. We describe the algorithms used to balance various
aesthetic criteria and create the distinctive Wordle layouts. We then
present the results of a study of Wordle usage, based both on
spontaneous behaviour observed in the wild, and on a large-scale survey
of Wordle users. The results suggest that Wordles have become a kind of
medium of expression, and that a ldquoparticipatory culturerdquo has
arisen around them.
