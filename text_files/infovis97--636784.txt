On integrating visualization techniques for effective software exploration.

This paper describes the SHriMP visualization technique for
seamlessly exploring software structure and browsing source code, with a
focus on effectively assisting hybrid program comprehension strategies.
The technique integrates both pan+zoom and fisheye-view visualization
approaches for exploring a nested graph view of software structure. The
fisheye-view approach handles multiple focal points, which are necessary
when examining several subsystems and their mutual interconnections.
Source code is presented by embedding code fragments within the nodes of
the nested graph. Finer connections among these fragments are
represented by a network that is navigated using a hypertext
link-following metaphor. SHriMP combines this hypertext metaphor with
animated panning and zooming motions over the nested graph to provide
continuous orientation and contextual cues for the user. The SHriMP tool
is being evaluated in several user studies. Observations of users
performing program understanding tasks with the tool are discussed.
