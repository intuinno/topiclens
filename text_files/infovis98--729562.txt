IVORY-an object-oriented framework for physics-based information visualization in Java.

        We present IVORY a newly developed, platform-independent
framework for physics based visualization. IVORY is especially designed
for information visualization applications and multidimensional graph
layout. It is fully implemented in Java 1.1 and its architecture
features client server setup, which allows us to run the visualization
even on thin clients. In addition, VRML 2.0 exports can be viewed by any
VRML plugged-in WWW browser. Individual visual metaphors are invoked
into IVORY via an advanced plug-in mechanism, where plug-ins can be
implemented by any experienced user. The configuration of IVORY is
accomplished using a script language, called IVML. Some interactive
visualization examples, such as the integration of a haptic interface
illustrate the performance and versatility of our system. Our current
implementation supports NT 4.0
