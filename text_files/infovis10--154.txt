FacetAtlas: Multifaceted Visualization for Rich Text Corpora.

Documents in rich text corpora usually contain multiple facets of
information. For example, an article about a specific disease often
consists of different facets such as symptom, treatment, cause,
diagnosis, prognosis, and prevention. Thus, documents may have
different relations based on different facets. Powerful search tools
have been developed to help users locate lists of individual documents
that are most related to specific keywords. However, there is a lack
of effective analysis tools that reveal the multifaceted relations of
documents within or cross the document clusters. In this paper, we
present FacetAtlas, a multifaceted visualization technique for
visually analyzing rich text corpora. FacetAtlas combines search
technology with advanced visual analytical tools to convey both global
and local patterns simultaneously. We describe several unique aspects
of FacetAtlas, including (1) node cliques and multifaceted edges, (2)
an optimized density map, and (3) automated opacity pattern
enhancement for highlighting visual patterns, (4) interactive context
switch between facets. In addition, we demonstrate the power of
FacetAtlas through a case study that targets patient education in the
health care domain. Our evaluation shows the benefits of this work,
especially in support of complex multifaceted data analysis.
