VAST contest dataset use in education.

The IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)
Symposium has held a contest each year since its inception in 2006.
These events are designed to provide visual analytics researchers and
developers with analytic challenges similar to those encountered by
professional information analysts. The VAST contest has had an extended
life outside of the symposium, however, as materials are being used in
universities and other educational settings, either to help teachers of
visual analytics-related classes or for student projects. We describe
how we develop VAST contest datasets that results in products that can
be used in different settings and review some specific examples of the
adoption of the VAST contest materials in the classroom. The examples
are drawn from graduate and undergraduate courses at Virginia Tech and
from the Visual Analytics ldquoSummer Camprdquo run by the National
Visualization and Analytics Center in 2008. We finish with a brief
discussion on evaluation metrics for education.
