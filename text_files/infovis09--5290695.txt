A Nested Process Model for Visualization Design and Validation.

We present a nested model for the visualization design and
validation with four layers: characterize the task and data in the
vocabulary of the problem domain, abstract into operations and data
types, design visual encoding and interaction techniques, and create
algorithms to execute techniques efficiently. The output from a level
above is input to the level below, bringing attention to the design
challenge that an upstream error inevitably cascades to all downstream
levels. This model provides prescriptive guidance for determining
appropriate evaluation approaches by identifying threats to validity
unique to each level. We also provide three recommendations motivated by
this model: authors should distinguish between these levels when
claiming contributions at more than one of them, authors should
explicitly state upstream assumptions at levels above the focus of a
paper, and visualization venues should accept more papers on domain
characterization.
