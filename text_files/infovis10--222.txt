WebCharts: Extending Applications with Web-Authored, Embeddable Visualizations. 

In order to use new visualizations, most toolkits require application
developers to rebuild their applications and distribute new versions
to users. The WebCharts Framework take a different approach by hosting
Javascript from within an application and providing a standard data
and events interchange.. In this way, applications can be extended
dynamically, with a wide variety of visualizations. We discuss the
benefits of this architectural approach, contrast it to existing
techniques, and give a variety of examples and extensions of the basic
system.
