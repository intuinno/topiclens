Case study. Narcissus: visualising information.

It is becoming increasingly important that support is provided
for users who are dealing with complex information spaces. The need is
driven by the growing number of domains where there is a requirement for
users to understand, navigate and manipulate large sets of computer
based data; by the increasing size and complexity of this information
and by the pressures to use this information efficiently. The
paradigmatic example is the World Wide Web, but other domains include
software systems, information systems and concurrent engineering. One
approach to providing this support is to provide sophisticated
visualisation tools which lead the users to form an intuitive
understanding of the structure and behaviour of their domain and which
provide mechanisms which allow them to manipulate objects within their
system. The paper describes such a tool and a number of visualisation
techniques that it implements.
