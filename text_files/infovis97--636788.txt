Coordinating declarative queries with a direct manipulation data exploration environment.

Interactive visualization techniques allow data exploration to
be a continuous process, rather than a discrete sequence of queries and
results as in traditional database systems. However limitations in
expressive power of current visualization systems force users to go
outside the system and form a new dataset in order to perform certain
operations, such as those involving the relationship among multiple
objects. Further, there is no support for integrating data from the new
dataset into previous visualizations, so users must recreate them.
Visage's information centric paradigm provides an architectural hook for
linking data across multiple queries, removing this overhead. This paper
describes the addition to Visage of a visual query language, called VQE,
which allows users to express more complicated queries than in previous
interactive visualization systems. Visualizations can be created from
queries and vice versa. When either is updated, the other changes to
maintain consistency.
