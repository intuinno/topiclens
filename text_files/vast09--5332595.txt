Finding comparable temporal categorical records: A similarity measure with an interactive visualization.

An increasing number of temporal categorical databases are
being collected: Electronic Health Records in healthcare organizations,
traffic incident logs in transportation systems, or student records in
universities. Finding similar records within these large databases
requires effective similarity measures that capture the searcher's
intent. Many similarity measures exist for numerical time series, but
temporal categorical records are different. We propose a temporal
categorical similarity measure, the M&M (Match & Mismatch) measure,
which is based on the concept of aligning records by sentinel events,
then matching events between the target and the compared records. The
M&M measure combines the time differences between pairs of events and
the number of mismatches. To accom-modate customization of parameters in
the M&M measure and results interpretation, we implemented Similan, an
interactive search and visualization tool for temporal categorical
records. A usability study with 8 participants demonstrated that Similan
was easy to learn and enabled them to find similar records, but users
had difficulty understanding the M&M measure. The usability study
feedback, led to an improved version with a continuous timeline, which
was tested in a pilot study with 5 participants.
