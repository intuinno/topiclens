Flow-based scatterplots for sensitivity analysis.

Visualization of multi-dimensional data is challenging due to the
number of complex correlations that may be present in the data but
that are difficult to be visually identified. One of the main causes
for this problem is the inherent loss of information that occurs when
high-dimensional data is projected into 2D or 3D. Although 2D
scatterplots are ubiquitous due to their simplicity and familiarity,
there are not a lot of variations on their basic metaphor. In this
paper, we present a new way of visualizing multidimensional data using
scatterplots. We extend 2D scatterplots using sensitivity coefficients
to highlight local variation of one variable with respect to
another. When applied to a scatterplot, these sensitivities can be
understood as velocities, and the resulting visualization resembles a
flow field. We also present a number of operations, based on
flow-field analysis, that help users navigate, select and cluster
points in an efficient manner. We show the flexibility and generality
of this approach using a number of multidimensional data sets across
different domains.
