An exploratory study of co-located collaborative visual analytics around a tabletop display.

Co-located collaboration can be extremely valuable during complex
visual analytics tasks. This paper presents an exploratory study of a
system designed to support collaborative visual analysis tasks on a
digital tabletop display. Fifteen participant pairs employed
Cam-biera, a visual analytics system, to solve a problem involving 240
digital documents. Our analysis, supported by observations, system
logs, questionnaires, and interview data, explores how pairs
approached the problem around the table. We contribute a unique, rich
understanding of how users worked together around the table and
identify eight types of collaboration styles that can be used to
identify how closely people work together while problem solving. We
show how the closeness of teams' collaboration influenced how well
they performed on the task overall. We further discuss the role of the
tabletop for visual analytics tasks and derive novel design
implications for future co-located collaborative tabletop problem
solving systems.
