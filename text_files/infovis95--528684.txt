SDM: malleable information graphics.

Selective dynamic manipulation (SDM) is a paradigm for
interacting with objects in visualizations. Its methods offer a high
degree of selectivity, in choosing object sets, in the selection of
interactive techniques and the properties they affect, and in the degree
to which a user action affects the visualization. Our goal is to provide
a flexible set of techniques and feedback mechanisms that enable users
to move objects and transform their appearance to perform a variety of
information analysis tasks.
