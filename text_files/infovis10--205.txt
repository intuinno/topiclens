The FlowVizMenu and Parallel Scatterplot Matrix: Hybrid Multidimensional Visualizations for Network Exploration.

A standard approach for visualizing multivariate networks is to use
one or more multidimensional views (for example, scatterplots) for
selecting nodes by various metrics, possibly coordinated with a
node-link view of the network. In this paper, we present three novel
approaches for achieving a tighter integration of these views through
hybrid techniques for multidimensional visualization, graph selection
and layout. First, we present the FlowVizMenu, a radial menu
containing a scatterplot that can be popped up transiently and
manipulated with rapid, fluid gestures to select and modify the axes
of its scatterplot. Second, the FlowVizMenu can be used to steer an
attribute-driven layout of the network, causing certain nodes of a
node-link diagram to move toward their corresponding positions in a
scatterplot while others can be positioned manually or by
force-directed layout. Third, we describe a novel hybrid approach that
combines a scatterplot matrix (SPLOM) and parallel coordinates called
the Parallel Scatterplot Matrix (P-SPLOM), which can be used to
visualize and select features within the network. We also describe a
novel arrangement of scatterplots called the Scatterplot Staircase
(SPLOS) that requires less space than a traditional scatterplot
matrix. Initial user feedback is reported.
