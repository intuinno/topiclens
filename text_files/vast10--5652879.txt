A closer look at note taking in the co-located collaborative visual analytics process.

This paper highlights the important role that record-keeping
(i.e. taking notes and saving charts) plays in collaborative data
analysis within the business domain. The discussion of record-keeping
is based on observations from a user study in which co-located teams
worked on collaborative visual analytics tasks using large interactive
wall and tabletop displays. Part of our findings is a collaborative
data analysis framework that encompasses note taking as one of the
main activities. We observed that record-keeping was a critical
activity within the analysis process. Based on our observations, we
characterize notes according to their content, scope, and usage, and
describe how they fit into a process of collaborative data
analysis. We then discuss suggestions for the design of collaborative
visual analytics tools.
