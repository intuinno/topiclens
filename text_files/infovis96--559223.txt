Animating multidimensional scaling to visualize N-dimensional data sets.

Many techniques have been developed for visualizing
multivariate (multidimensional) data. Most, if not all, are limited by
the number of dimensions which can be effectively displayed.
Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is an iterative non-linear technique for
projecting n-D data down to a lower number of dimensions. This work
presents extensions to MDS that enhance visualization of
high-dimensional data sets. These extensions include animation,
stochastic perturbation, and flow visualization techniques
