Visualizing the non-visual: spatial analysis and interaction with information from text documents.

The paper describes an approach to IV that involves
spatializing text content for enhanced visual browsing and analysis. The
application arena is large text document corpora such as digital
libraries, regulations and procedures, archived reports, etc. The basic
idea is that text content from these sources may be transformed to a
spatial representation that preserves informational characteristics from
the documents. The spatial representation may then be visually browsed
and analyzed in ways that avoid language processing and that reduce the
analysts mental workload. The result is an interaction with text that
more nearly resembles perception and action with the natural world than
with the abstractions of written language.
