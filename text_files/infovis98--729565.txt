Visualizing decision table classifiers.

        Decision tables, like decision trees or neural nets, are
classification models used for prediction. They are induced by machine
learning algorithms. A decision table consists of a hierarchical table
in which each entry in a higher level table gets broken down by the
values of a pair of additional attributes to form another table. The
structure is similar to dimensional stacking. A visualization method is
presented that allows a model based on many attributes to be understood
even by those unfamiliar with machine learning. Various forms of
interaction are used to make this visualization more useful than other
static designs
