Graphical inference for infovis.

How do we know if what we see is really there? When visualizing data,
how do we avoid falling into the trap of apophenia where we see
patterns in random noise? Traditionally, infovis has been concerned
with discovering new relationships, and statistics with preventing
spurious relationships from being reported. We pull these opposing
poles closer with two new techniques for rigorous statistical
inference of visual discoveries. The "Rorschach" helps the analyst
calibrate their understanding of uncertainty and "line-up" provides a
protocol for assessing the significance of visual discoveries,
protecting against the discovery of spurious structure.
