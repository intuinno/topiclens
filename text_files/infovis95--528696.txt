Case study: visualizing Internet resources.

The goal is to improve the ability of people from all walks of
life and interests to access, search, and use the information
distributed in Internet resources. The process of interacting with
information resources starts with browsing, continues with digesting and
assimilating pieces of information, terminates with generation of new
information, and begins anew with analysis of pre-existing and new
information. Our approach is user-centric-taking users needs into
account by allowing them to interact with the information contained in
large arrays of documents. The visualization process is an integral part
of the overall process. We have covered three related categories in this
methodology. The first one is browsing through the World-Wide Web (WWW)
hyperspace without becoming lost, based on a visual representation of
the hyperspace hierarchical structure (hyperspace view). The second
category is overcoming the rigidity of the WWW by allowing the user to
construct interactively and visually a personal hyperspace of
information, linking the documents according to the application or
problem domain, or to the user's own perception, experience, culture, or
way of thinking. The third category includes discovery and analysis of
new information and relationships in retrieved documents by aggregating
relevant information and representing it visually.
