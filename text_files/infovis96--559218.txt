Towards rich information landscapes for visualising structured Web spaces.

The Harmony browser for the Hyper-G Web server utilises
Hyper-G's rich data model to provide a number of tightly-coupled, two-
and three-dimensional visualisation and navigational facilities. In
particular the Harmony Information Landscape visualises the hierarchical
structure of Hyper-G spaces upon a plane in three-dimensional space. The
Harmony Information Landscape has now been extended to display a
combined structure and link map by selectively superimposing hyperlink
relationships in the vertical dimension above and below the hierarchy
map. In addition, documents returned by search queries may be
selectively ?plotted? in the landscape, indicating their whereabouts in
a broader context, and several sets of 3D icons are available for
representing the various document types
