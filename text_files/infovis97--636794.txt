Metrics for effective information visualization.

Metrics for information visualization will help designers
create and evaluate 3D information visualizations. Based on experience
from 60+ 3D information visualizations, the metrics we propose are:
number of data points and data density; number of dimensions and
cognitive overhead; occlusion percentage; and reference context and
percentage of identifiable points.
