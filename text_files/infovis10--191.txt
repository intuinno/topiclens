Rethinking Map Legends with Visualization.

This design paper presents new guidance for creating map legends in a
dynamic environment. Our contribution is a set ofguidelines for legend
design in a visualization context and a series of illustrative themes
through which they may be expressed. Theseare demonstrated in an
applications context through interactive software prototypes. The
guidelines are derived from cartographicliterature and in liaison with
EDINA who provide digital mapping services for UK tertiary
education. They enhance approaches tolegend design that have evolved
for static media with visualization by considering: selection, layout,
symbols, position, dynamismand design and process. Broad visualization
legend themes include: The Ground Truth Legend, The Legend as
Statistical Graphicand The Map is the Legend. Together, these concepts
enable us to augment legends with dynamic properties that address
specificneeds, rethink their nature and role and contribute to a wider
re-evaluation of maps as artifacts of usage rather than statements
offact. EDINA has acquired funding to enhance their clients with
visualization legends that use these concepts as a consequence ofthis
work. The guidance applies to the design of a wide range of legends
and keys used in cartography and information visualization.
