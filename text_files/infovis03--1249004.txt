Smooth and efficient zooming and panning.

Large 2D information spaces, such as maps, images, or abstract
visualizations, require views at various level of detail: close ups to
inspect details, overviews to maintain (literally) an overview. Users
often switch between these views. We discuss how smooth animations from
one view to another can be defined. To this end, a metric on the effect
of simultaneous zooming and panning is defined, based on an estimate of
the perceived velocity. Optimal is defined as smooth and efficient.
Given the metric, these terms can be translated into a computational
model, which is used to calculate an analytic solution for optimal
animations. The model has two free parameters: animation speed and
zoom/pan trade off. A user experiment to find good values for these is
described.
