Techniques for non-linear magnification transformations.

This paper presents efficient methods for implementing general
non-linear magnification transformations. Techniques are provided for:
combining linear and non-linear magnifications, constraining the domain
of magnifications, combining multiple transformations, and smoothly
interpolating between magnified and normal views. In addition, piecewise
linear methods are introduced which allow greater efficiency and
expressiveness than their continuous counterparts
