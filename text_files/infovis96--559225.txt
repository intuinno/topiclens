Geospatial metadata querying and visualization on the WWW using Java^TM applets.

This paper presents the query and visualization interfaces of
the Master Environmental Library (MEL) system. MEL uses the World Wide
Web (WWW) to make accessible distributed data whose metadata conform to
the Federal Geographic Data Committee's (FGDC) content standards for
digital geospatial metadata. The interfaces are implemented as Java^TM
applets and are more intuitive, interactive and possess greater
functionality than their Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) counterparts.
As well as querying, the interface allows users to visualize and manage
the list of query results so that users can more quickly discover the
datasets of real interest. Several new tools used to visualize
attributes of the metadata are presented
