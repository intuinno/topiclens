Dual multiresolution HyperSlice for multivariate data visualization .

We present a new multiresolution visualization design which
allows a user to control the physical data resolution as well as the
logical display resolution of multivariate data. A system prototype is
described which uses the HyperSlice representation. The notion of space
projection in multivariate data is introduced. This process is coupled
with wavelets to form a powerful tool for very large data visualization
