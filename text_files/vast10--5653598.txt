Helping users recall their reasoning process.

The final product of an analyst's investigation using a visualization
is often a report of the discovered knowledge, as well as the methods
employed and reasoning behind the discovery. We believe that analysts
may have difficulty keeping track of their knowledge discovery process
and will require tools to assist in accurately recovering their
reasoning. We first report on a study examining analysts' recall of
their strategies and methods, demonstrating their lack of memory of
the path of knowledge discovery. We then explore whether a tool
visualizing the steps of the visual analysis can aid users in
recalling their reasoning process. The results of our second study
indicate that visualizations of interaction logs can serve as an
effective memory aid, allowing analysts to recall additional details
of their strategies and decisions.
