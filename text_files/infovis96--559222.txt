FINESSE: a financial information spreadsheet.

We outline a spreadsheet-based system for visualization of
real-time financial information. Our system permits the user to define
arithmetic and presentation relationships amongst the various cells of
the spreadsheet. The cells contain primitives that can be numbers, text,
images, functions and graphics. Presenting financial information in this
format allows its intended clients, the financial analysts, to work in
the familiar environment of a spreadsheet and allows them the
flexibility afforded by the powerful interface of the spreadsheet
paradigm. In addition, our system permits real-time visualization of the
financial data stream allowing its user to visually trade the changing
market trends in two and three dimensions
