A visual analytics system for radio frequency fingerprinting-based localization.

Radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting-based techniques for
localization are a promising approach for ubiquitous positioning
systems, particularly indoors. By finding unique fingerprints of RF
signals received at different locations within a predefined area
beforehand, whenever a similar fingerprint is subsequently seen again,
the localization system will be able to infer a user's current location.
However, developers of these systems face the problem of finding
reliable RF fingerprints that are unique enough and adequately stable
over time. We present a visual analytics system that enables developers
of these localization systems to visually gain insight on whether their
collected datasets and chosen fingerprint features have the necessary
properties to enable a reliable RF fingerprinting-based localization
system. The system was evaluated by testing and debugging an existing
localization system.
