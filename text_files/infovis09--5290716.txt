SpicyNodes: Radial Layout Authoring for the General Public.

Trees and graphs are relevant to many online tasks such as
visualizing social networks, product catalogs, educational portals,
digital libraries, the semantic web, concept maps and personalized
information management. SpicyNodes is an information-visualization
technology that builds upon existing research on radial tree layouts and
graph structures. Users can browse a tree, clicking from node to node,
as well as successively viewing a node, immediately related nodes and
the path back to the ldquohomerdquo nodes. SpicyNodes' layout algorithms
maintain balanced layouts using a hybrid mixture of a geometric layout
(a succession of spanning radial trees) and force-directed layouts to
minimize overlapping nodes, plus several other improvements over prior
art. It provides XML-based API and GUI authoring tools. The goal of the
SpicyNodes project is to implement familiar principles of radial maps
and focus+context with an attractive and inviting look and feel in an
open system that is accessible to virtually any Internet user.
