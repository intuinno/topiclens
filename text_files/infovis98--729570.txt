Multi-faceted insight through interoperable visual information analysis paradigms.

        To gain insight and understanding of complex information
collections, users must be able to visualize and explore many facets of
the information. The paper presents several novel visual methods from an
information analyst's perspective. The authors present a sample
scenario, using the various methods to gain a variety of insights from a
large information collection. They conclude that no single paradigm or
visual method is sufficient for many analytical tasks. Often a suite of
integrated methods offers a better analytic environment in today's
emerging culture of information overload and rapidly changing issues.
They also conclude that the interactions among these visual paradigms
are equally as important as, if not more important than, the paradigms
themselves
