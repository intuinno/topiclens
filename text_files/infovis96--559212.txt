Rapid prototyping of information visualizations using VANISH.

Discusses a software tool called VANISH (Visualizing And
Navigating Information Structured Hierarchically), which supports the
rapid prototyping of interactive 2D and 3D information visualizations.
VANISH supports rapid prototyping through a special-purpose visual
language called VaPL (VANISH Programming Language) tailored for
visualizations, through a software architecture that insulates
visualization-specific code from changes in both the domain being
visualized and the presentation toolkit used, and through the reuse of
visualization techniques between application domains. The generality of
VANISH is established by showing how it is able to re-create a wide
variety of ?standard? visualization techniques. VANISH's support for
prototyping is shown through an extended example, where we build a C++
class browser, exploring many visualization alternatives in the process
