Visualizing information on a sphere.

We describe a method for the visualization of information
units on spherical domains which is employed in the banking industry for
risk analysis, stock prediction and other tasks. The system is based on
a quantification of the similarity of related objects that governs the
parameters of a mass-spring system. Unlike existing approaches we
initialize all information units onto the inner surface of two
concentric spheres and attach them with springs to the outer sphere.
Since the spring stiffnesses correspond to the computed similarity
measures, the system converges into an energy minimum which reveals
multidimensional relations and adjacencies in terms of spatial
neighborhoods. Depending on the application scenario our approach
supports different topological arrangements of related objects. In order
to cope with large data sets we propose a blobby clustering mechanism
that enables encapsulation of similar objects by implicit shapes. In
addition, we implemented various interaction techniques allowing
semantic analysis of the underlying data sets. Our prototype system
IVORY is written in Java, and its versatility is illustrated by an
example from financial service providers.
