Case study: an empirical investigation of thumbnail imag recognition.

The use of thumbnails (i.e., miniatures) in the user-interface
of image databases allows searching and selection of images without the
need for naming policies. Treating parent images prior to reduction with
edge-detecting smoothing, lossy image compression, or static codebook
compression resulted in thumbnails where the distortion caused by
reduction was lessened. An experiment assessing these techniques found
resulting thumbnails could be recognised more quickly and accurately
than thumbnails of the same parent images that had been reduced without
treatment. This pretreatment in thumbnail creation is offered as an
improvement.
