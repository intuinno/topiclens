IVEE: an Information Visualization and Exploration Environment.

The Information Visualization and Exploration Environment
(NEE) is a system for automatic creation of dynamic queries
applications. IVEE imports database relations and automatically creates
environments holding visualizations and query devices. IVEE offers
multiple visualizations such as maps and starfields, and multiple query
devices, such as sliders, alphasliders, and toggles. Arbitrary graphical
objects can be attached to database objects in visualizations. Multiple
visualizations may be active simultaneously. Users can interactively lay
out and change between types of query devices. Users may retrieve
details-on-demand by clicking on visualization objects. An HTML file may
be provided along with the database, specifying how details-on-demand
information should be presented, allowing for presentation of multimedia
information in database objects. Finally, multiple IVEE clients running
on separate workstations on a network can communicate by letting one
user's actions affect the visualization in an another IVEE client.
