Dynamic aggregation with circular visual designs.

        One very effective method for managing large data sets is
aggregation or binning. We consider two aggregation methods that are
tightly coupled with interactive manipulation and the visual
representation of the data. Through this integration we hope to provide
effective support for the aggregation process, specifically by enabling:
1) automatic aggregation, 2) continuous change and control of the
aggregation level, 3) spatially based aggregates, 4) context maintenance
across different aggregate levels, and 5) feedback on the level of
aggregation
