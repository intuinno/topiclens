Volume rendering for relational data.

A method for efficiently volume rendering dense scatterplots
of relational data is described. Plotting difficulties that arise from
large numbers of data points, categorical variables, interaction with
non-axis dimensions, and unknown values, are addressed by this method.
The domain of the plot is voxelized using binning and then volume
rendering. Since a table is used as the underlying data structure, no
storage is wasted on regions with no data. The opacity of each voxel is
a function of the number of data points in a corresponding bin. A
voxel's color is derived by averaging the value of one of the variables
for all the data points that fall in a bin. Other variables in the data
may be mapped to external query sliders. A dragger object permits a user
to select regions inside the volume.
