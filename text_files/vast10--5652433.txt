Improving the visual analysis of high-dimensional datasets using quality measures.

Modern visualization methods are needed to cope with very
high-dimensional data. Efficient visual analytical techniques are
required to extract the information content in these data. The large
number of possible projections for each method, which usually grow
quadrat-ically or even exponentially with the number of dimensions,
urges the necessity to employ automatic reduction techniques,
automatic sorting or selecting the projections, based on their
information-bearing content. Different quality measures have been
successfully applied for several specified user tasks and established
visualization techniques, like Scatterplots, Scatterplot Matrices or
Parallel Coordinates. Many other popular visualization techniques
exist, but due to the structural differences, the measures are not
directly applicable to them and new approaches are needed. In this
paper we propose new quality measures for three popular visualization
methods: Radviz, Pixel-Oriented Displays and Table Lenses. Our
experiments show that these measures efficiently guide the visual
analysis task.
