Research report: information animation applications in the capital markets.

3D computer graphics can be extremely expressive. It is
possible to display an entire securities market, like the S&P 500, on a
single screen. With the correct approach to the visual design of the
layout, these massive amounts of information can be quickly and easily
comprehended by a human observer. By using motion and animated
interaction, it is possible to use 3D as a reliable, accurate and
precise decision-support tool. Information animation applications are
particularly suited to the securities industry because that is where we
find huge amounts of data, the value of which declines rapidly with
time, and where critical decisions are being made on this data in very
short periods of time. Information animation technology is an important
new tool for the securities industry, where people need to be in the
decision-making loop without suffering from information overload.
Several examples are discussed including equity trading analytics, fixed
income trading analytics and fixed-income risk viewing.
