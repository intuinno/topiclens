H3: laying out large directed graphs in 3D hyperbolic space.

We present the H3 layout technique for drawing large directed
graphs as node-link diagrams in 3D hyperbolic space. We can lay out much
larger structures than can be handled using traditional techniques for
drawing general graphs because we assume a hierarchical nature of the
data. We impose a hierarchy on the graph by using domain-specific
knowledge to find an appropriate spanning tree. Links which are not part
of the spanning tree do not influence the layout but can be selectively
drawn by user request. The volume of hyperbolic 3-space increases
exponentially, as opposed to the familiar geometric increase of
euclidean 3-space. We exploit this exponential amount of room by
computing the layout according to the hyperbolic metric. We optimize the
cone tree layout algorithm for 3D hyperbolic space by placing children
on a hemisphere around the cone mouth instead of on its perimeter.
Hyperbolic navigation affords a Focus+Context view of the structure with
minimal visual clutter. We have successfully laid out hierarchies of
over 20,000 nodes. Our implementation accommodates navigation through
graphs too large to be rendered interactively by allowing the user to
explicitly prune or expand subtrees.
