Visualizing usability log data.

Our approach to testing graphical user interfaces involves
logging large amounts of data. These logs capture information at the key
press and mouse click level about how an application is used. Since the
raw data is voluminous and not at a useful level of detail, we use
analysis and visualization to find information that is interesting and
useful to a usability analyst but was previously buried in the data. We
call some of our custom visualizations ?contextual? meaning they use key
elements of the context the data was collected in as an organizing
structure. We expect this type of visualization to be easier and faster
to understand and more helpful than traditional charts. We hope that our
finding a natural geometry for these visualizations will inspire others
whose data apparently has no inherent geometry to find natural ways to
visualize their data
