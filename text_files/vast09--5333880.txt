A multi-level middle-out cross-zooming approach for large graph analytics.

This paper presents a working graph analytics model that
embraces the strengths of the traditional top-down and bottom-up
approaches with a resilient crossover concept to exploit the vast
middle-ground information overlooked by the two extreme analytical
approaches. Our graph analytics model is co-developed by users and
researchers, who carefully studied the functional requirements that
reflect the critical thinking and interaction pattern of a real-life
intelligence analyst. To evaluate the model, we implement a system
prototype, known as GreenHornet, which allows our analysts to test the
theory in practice, identify the technological and usage-related gaps in
the model, and then adapt the new technology in their work space. The
paper describes the implementation of GreenHornet and compares its
strengths and weaknesses against the other prevailing models and tools.
