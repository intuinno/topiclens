Gremlin: An Interactive Visualization Model for Analyzing Genomic Rearrangements.

In this work we present, apply, and evaluate a novel, interactive
visualization model for comparative analysis of structural variants
and rearrangements in human and cancer genomes, with emphasis on data
integration and uncertainty visualization. To support both global
trend analysis and local feature detection, this model enables
explorations continuously scaled from the high-level, complete genome
perspective, down to the low-level, structural rearrangement view,
while preserving global context at all times. We have implemented
these techniques in Gremlin, a genomic rearrangement explorer with
multi-scale, linked interactions, which we apply to four human cancer
genome data sets for evaluation. Using an insight-based evaluation
methodology, we compare Gremlin to Circos, the state-of-the-art in
genomic rearrangement visualization, through a small user study with
computational biologists working in rearrangement analysis. Results
from user study evaluations demonstrate that this visualization model
enables more total insights, more insights per minute, and more
complex insights than the current state-of-the-art for visual analysis
and exploration of genome rearrangements.
