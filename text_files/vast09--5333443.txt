Parallel Tag Clouds to explore and analyze faceted text corpora.

Do court cases differ from place to place? What kind of
picture do we get by looking at a country's collection of law cases? We
introduce parallel tag clouds: a new way to visualize differences
amongst facets of very large metadata-rich text corpora. We have pointed
parallel tag clouds at a collection of over 600,000 US Circuit Court
decisions spanning a period of 50 years and have discovered regional as
well as linguistic differences between courts. The visualization
technique combines graphical elements from parallel coordinates and
traditional tag clouds to provide rich overviews of a document
collection while acting as an entry point for exploration of individual
texts. We augment basic parallel tag clouds with a details-in-context
display and an option to visualize changes over a second facet of the
data, such as time. We also address text mining challenges such as
selecting the best words to visualize, and how to do so in reasonable
time periods to maintain interactivity.
