FundExplorer: supporting the diversification of mutual fund portfolios using context treemaps.

An equity mutual fund is a financial instrument that invests
in a set of stocks. Any two different funds may partially invest in some
of the same stocks, thus overlap is common. Portfolio diversification
aims at spreading an investment over many different stocks in search of
greater returns. Helping people with portfolio diversification is
challenging because it requires informing them about both their current
portfolio of stocks held through funds and the other stocks in the
market not invested in yet. Current stock/fund visualization systems
either waste screen real estate and visualization of all data points. We
have developed a system called FundExplorer that implements a distorted
treemap to visualize both the amount of money invested in a person's
fund portfolio and the context of remaining market stocks. The
FundExplorer system enables people to interactively explore
diversification possibilities with their
portfolios.
