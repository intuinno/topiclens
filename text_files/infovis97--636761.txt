A spreadsheet approach to information visualization.

In information visualization, as the volume and complexity of
the data increases, researchers require more powerful visualization
tools that enable them to more effectively explore multidimensional
datasets. We discuss the general utility of a novel visualization
spreadsheet framework. Just as a numerical spreadsheet enables
exploration of numbers, a visualization spreadsheet enables exploration
of visual forms of information. We show that the spreadsheet approach
facilitates certain information visualization tasks that are more
difficult using other approaches. Unlike traditional spreadsheets, which
store only simple data elements and formulas in each cell, a
visualization spreadsheet cell can hold an entire complex data set,
selection criteria, viewing specifications, and other information needed
for a full-fledged information visualization. Similarly, inter-cell
operations are far more complex, stretching beyond simple arithmetic and
string operations to encompass a range of domain-specific operators. We
have built two prototype systems that illustrate some of these research
issues. The underlying approach in our work allows domain experts to
define new data types and data operations, and enables visualization
experts to incorporate new visualizations, viewing parameters, and view
operations.
