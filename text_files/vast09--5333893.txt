Visual analysis of graphs with multiple connected components.

In this paper, we present a system for the interactive
visualization and exploration of graphs with many weakly connected
components. The visualization of large graphs has recently received much
research attention. However, specific systems for visual analysis of
graph data sets consisting of many components are rare. In our approach,
we rely on graph clustering using an extensive set of topology
descriptors. Specifically, we use the self-organizing-map algorithm in
conjunction with a user-adaptable combination of graph features for
clustering of graphs. It offers insight into the overall structure of
the data set. The clustering output is presented in a grid containing
clusters of the connected components of the input graph. Interactive
feature selection and task-tailored data views allow the exploration of
the whole graph space. The system provides also tools for assessment and
display of cluster quality. We demonstrate the usefulness of our system
by application to a shareholder network analysis problem based on a
large real-world data set. While so far our approach is applied to
weighted directed graphs only, it can be used for various graph types.
