Matching Visual Saliency to Confidence in Plots of Uncertain Data.

Conveying data uncertainty in visualizations is crucial for preventing
viewers from drawing conclusions based on untrustworthy data
points. This paper proposes a methodology for efficiently generating
density plots of uncertain multivariate data sets that draws viewers
to preattentively identify values of high certainty while not calling
attention to uncertain values. We demonstrate how to augment scatter
plots and parallel coordinates plots to incorporate statistically
modeled uncertainty and show how to integrate them with existing
multivariate analysis techniques, including outlier detection and
interactive brushing. Computing high quality density plots can be
expensive for large data sets, so we also describe a probabilistic
plotting technique that summarizes the data without requiring explicit
density plot computation. These techniques have been useful for
identifying brain tumors in multivariate magnetic resonance
spectroscopy data and we describe how to extend them to visualize
ensemble data sets.
