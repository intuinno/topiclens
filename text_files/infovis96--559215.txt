Distortion viewing techniques for 3-dimensional data.

As the use of 3D information presentation becomes more
prevalent, the need for effective viewing tools grows accordingly. Much
work has been done in developing tools for 2D spaces which allow for
detail in context views. We examine the extension of such 2D methods to
3D and explore the limitations encountered in accessing internal regions
of the data with these methods. We then describe a novel solution to
this problem of internal access with the introduction of a distortion
function which creates a clear line of sight to the focus revealing
sections previously obscured. The distortion is symmetric about the line
of sight and is smoothly integrated back into the original 3D layout
