Domesticating Bead: adapting an information visualization system to a financial institution.

The Bead visualization system employs a fast algorithm for
laying out high-dimensional data in a low-dimensional space, and a
number of features added to 3D visualizations to improve imageability.
We describe recent work on both aspects of the system, in particular a
generalization of the data types laid out and the implementation of
imageability features in a 2D visualization tool. The variety of data
analyzed in a financial institution such as UBS, and the ubiquity of
spreadsheets as a medium for analysis, led us to extend our layout tools
to handle data in a generic spreadsheet format. We describe the metrics
of similarity used for this data type, and give examples of layouts of
sets of records of financial trades. Conservatism and scepticism with
regard to 3D visualization, along with the lack of functionality of
widely available 3D web browsers, led to the development of a 2D
visualization tool with refinements of a number of our imageability
features.
