Adaptive information visualization based on the user's multiple viewpoints-interactive 3D visualization of the WWW.

We introduce the adaptive information visualization method for
hypermedia and the WWW based on the user's multiple viewpoints. We
propose two graphical interfaces, the CVI and the RF-Cone. The CVI is
the interface for interactive viewpoint selection. We can select a
viewpoint reflecting our interests by using the CVI. According to the
given viewpoint, the RF-Cone adaptively organizes the 3D representation
of the hypermedia so that we can understand the semantic and structural
relationship of the hypermedia and easily retrieve the information.
Combining these methods, we have developed the WWW visualization system
which can provide highly efficient navigation.
