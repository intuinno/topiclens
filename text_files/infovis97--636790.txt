Design and evaluation of incremental data structures and algorithms for dynamic query interfaces.

A dynamic query interface (DQI) is a database access mechanism
that provides continuous real-time feedback to the user during query
formulation. Previous work shows that DQIs are elegant and powerful
interfaces to small databases. Unfortunately, when applied to large
databases, previous DQI algorithms slow to a crawl. We present a new
incremental approach to DQI algorithms and display updates that work
well with large databases, both in theory and in practice.
