Describing story evolution from dynamic information streams.

Sources of streaming information, such as news syndicates,
publish information continuously. Information portals and news
aggregators list the latest information from around the world enabling
information consumers to easily identify events in the past 24 hours.
The volume and velocity of these streams causes information from prior
days to quickly vanish despite its utility in providing an informative
context for interpreting new information. Few capabilities exist to
support an individual attempting to identify or understand trends and
changes from streaming information over time. The burden of retaining
prior information and integrating with the new is left to the skills,
determination, and discipline of each individual. In this paper we
present a visual analytics system for linking essential content from
information streams over time into dynamic stories that develop and
change over multiple days. We describe particular challenges to the
analysis of streaming information and present a fundamental visual
representation for showing story change and evolution over time.
