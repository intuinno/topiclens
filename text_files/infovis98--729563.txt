Geographic visualization: designing manipulable maps for exploring temporally varying georeferenced statistics.

        Geographic visualization, sometimes called cartographic
visualization, is a form of information visualization in which
principles from cartography, geographic information systems (GIS),
exploratory data analysis (EDA), and information visualization more
generally are integrated in the development and assessment of visual
methods that facilitate the exploration, analysis, synthesis, and
presentation of georeferenced information. The authors report on
development and use of one component of a prototype GVis environment
designed to facilitate exploration, by domain experts, of time series
multivariate georeferenced health statistics. Emphasis is on how
manipulable dynamic GVis tools may facilitate visual thinking, pattern
noticing, and hypothesis generation. The prototype facilitates the
highlighting of data extremes, examination of change in geographic
patterns over time, and exploration of similarity among georeferenced
variables. A qualitative exploratory analysis of verbal protocols and
transaction logs is used to characterize system use. Evidence produced
through the characterization highlights differences among experts in
data analysis strategies (particularly in relation to the use of
attribute ?focusing? combined with time series animation) and
corresponding differences in success at noticing spatiotemporal patterns
