DEPICT: Documents Evaluated as Pictures. Visualizing information using context vectors and self-organizing maps.

HNC Software, Inc. has developed a system called DEPICT for
visualizing the information content of large textual corpora. The system
is built around two separate neural network methodologies: context
vectors and self-organizing maps. Context vectors (CVs) are high
dimensional information representations that encode the semantic content
of the textual entities they represent. Self-organizing maps (SOMs) are
capable of transforming an input, high dimensional signal space into a
much lower (usually two or three) dimensional output space useful for
visualization. Neither process requires human intervention, nor an
external knowledge base. Together, these neural network techniques can
be utilized to automatically identify the relevant information themes
present in a corpus, and present those themes to the user in a intuitive
visual form
