Cacti: a front end for program visualization.

We describe a system that allows the user to rapidly construct
program visualizations over a variety of data sources. Such a system is
a necessary foundation for using visualization as an aid to software
understanding. The system supports an arbitrary set of data sources so
that information from both static and dynamic analysis can be combined
to offer meaningful software visualizations. It provides the user with a
visual universal-relation front end that supports the definition of
queries over multiple data sources without knowledge of the structure or
contents of the sources. It uses a flexible back end with a range of
different visualizations, most geared to the efficient display of large
amounts of data. The result is a high-quality, easy-to-define program
visualization that can address specific problems and hence is useful for
software understanding. The overall system is flexible and extensible in
that both the underlying data model and the set of visualizations are
defined in resource files.
