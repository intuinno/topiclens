Minimally-immersive interactive volumetric information visualization.

This paper describes a minimally immersive volumetric
interactive system for information visualization. The system, SFA, uses
glyph-based volume rendering, enabling more information attributes to be
visualized than traditional 2D and surface-based information
visualization systems. Two-handed interaction and stereoscopic viewing
combine to produce a minimally immersive interactive system that
enhances the user's three-dimensional perception of the information
space, capitalizing on the human visual system's pre-attentive learning
capabilities to quickly analyze the displayed information. The paper
describes the usefulness of this system for the visualization of
document similarity within a corpus of textual documents. SFA allows the
three-dimensional volumetric visualization, manipulation, navigation,
and analysis of multivariate, time-varying information spaces,
increasing the quantity and clarity of information conveyed from the
visualization as compared to traditional 2D information systems
