The shape of Shakespeare: visualizing text using implicit surfaces .

        Information visualization focuses on the use of visual means
for exploring non-visual information. While free-form text is a rich,
common source of information, visualization of text is a challenging
problem since text is inherently non-spatial. The paper explores the use
of implicit surface models for visualizing text. The authors describe
several techniques for text visualization that aid in understanding
document content and document relationships. A simple method is defined
for mapping document content to shape. By comparing the shapes of
multiple documents, global content similarities and differences may be
noted. In addition, they describe a visual clustering method in which
documents are arranged in 3D based upon similarity scoring. Documents
deemed closely related blend together as a single connected shape.
Hence, a document corpus becomes a collection of shapes that reflect
inter-document relationships. These techniques provide methods to
visualize individual documents as well as corpus meta-data. They then
combine the two techniques to produce transparent clusters enclosing
individual document shapes. This provides a way to visualize both local
and global contextual information. Finally, they elaborate on several
potential applications of these methods
