The structure of the information visualization design space.

Research on information visualization has reached the point
where a number of successful point designs have been proposed and a
variety of techniques have been discovered. It is now appropriate to
describe and analyze portions of the design space so as to understand
the differences among designs and to suggest new possibilities. This
paper proposes an organization of the information visualization
literature and illustrates it with a series of examples. The result is a
framework for designing new visualizations and augmenting existing
designs.
