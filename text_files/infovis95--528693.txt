Case study: fishing for information on the Internet.

As the Internet continues to grow, the amount of accessible
information becomes increasingly vast. Search tools exist that allow
users to find relevant information. However, a search can often produce
such a large amount of data that it becomes hard to ferret out the most
appropriate and highest quality information. In addition, some search
tools lose valuable information when displaying the results to the user.
The paper describes a search visualization tool, called FISH, for
viewing hierarchically structured information and managing information
overload. FISH (Forager for the Information Super Highway) allows users
to visualize the results of search requests across large document spaces
in a way that preserves the structure of the information space. FISH
displays the returned documents as rectangles, using a combination of
order, indentation, size, and color to denote document hierarchy, the
score of the documents with respect to the search, and other data
attributes. In addition, the user can navigate through the document
space for in-depth probing and refinement.
