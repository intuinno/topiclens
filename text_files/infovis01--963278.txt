Getting along: composition of visualization paradigms.

This paper describes how focus+context techniques can be composed with other high-level visualization paradigms to mutual advantage. Examples are given showing composition both with a pan&zoom system, and with a treemap implementation. The examples illustrate how focus+context can be used as an exploration and navigation tool within those paradigms.
