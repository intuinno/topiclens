Model space visualization for multivariate linear trend discovery.

Discovering and extracting linear trends and correlations in
datasets is very important for analysts to understand multivariate
phenomena. However, current widely used multivariate visualization
techniques, such as parallel coordinates and scatterplot matrices, fail
to reveal and illustrate such linear relationships intuitively,
especially when more than 3 variables are involved or multiple trends
coexist in the dataset. We present a novel multivariate model parameter
space visualization system that helps analysts discover single and
multiple linear patterns and extract subsets of data that fit a model
well. Using this system, analysts are able to explore and navigate in
model parameter space, interactively select and tune patterns, and
refine the model for accuracy using computational techniques. We build
connections between model space and data space visually, allowing
analysts to employ their domain knowledge during exploration to better
interpret the patterns they discover and their validity. Case studies
with real datasets are used to investigate the effectiveness of the
visualizations.
