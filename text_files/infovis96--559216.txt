Selection: 524,288 ways to say ?this is interesting? .

Visualization is a critical technology for understanding
complex, data-rich systems. Effective visualizations make important
features of the data immediately recognizable and enable the user to
discover interesting and useful results by highlighting patterns. A key
element of such systems is the ability to interact with displays of data
by selecting a subset for further investigation. This operation is
needed for use in linked-views systems and in drill-down analysis. It is
a common manipulation in many other systems. It is as ubiquitous as
selecting icons in a desktop GUI. It is therefore surprising to note
that little research has been done on how selection can be implemented.
This paper addresses this omission, presenting a taxonomy for selection
mechanisms and discussing the interactions between branches of the
taxonomy. Our suggestion of 524,288 possible systems [2^16 operation
systems? (memory/memoryless)? (data-dependent/independent)?
(brush/lasso)] is more in fun than serious, as within the taxonomy there
are many different choices that can be made. This framework is the
result of considering both the current state of the art and historical
antecedents
