LSAView: A tool for visual exploration of latent semantic modeling.

Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a commonly-used method for
automated processing, modeling, and analysis of unstructured text data.
One of the biggest challenges in using LSA is determining the
appropriate model parameters to use for different data domains and types
of analyses. Although automated methods have been developed to make rank
and scaling parameter choices, these approaches often make choices with
respect to noise in the data, without an understanding of how those
choices impact analysis and problem solving. Further, no tools currently
exist to explore the relationships between an LSA model and analysis
methods. Our work focuses on how parameter choices impact analysis and
problem solving. In this paper, we present LSAView, a system for
interactively exploring parameter choices for LSA models. We illustrate
the use of LSAView's small multiple views, linked matrix-graph views,
and data views to analyze parameter selection and application in the
context of graph layout and clustering.
