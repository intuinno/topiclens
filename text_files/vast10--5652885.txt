Click2Annotate: Automated Insight Externalization with rich semantics.

Insight Externalization (IE) refers to the process of capturing and
recording the semantics of insights in decision making and problem
solving. To reduce human effort, Automated Insight Externalization
(AIE) is desired. Most existing IE approaches achieve automation by
capturing events (e.g., clicks and key presses) or actions (e.g.,
panning and zooming). In this paper, we propose a novel AIE approach
named Click2Annotate. It allows semi-automatic insight annotation that
captures low-level analytics task results (e.g., clusters and
outliers), which have higher semantic richness and abstraction levels
than actions and events. Click2Annotate has two significant
benefits. First, it reduces human effort required in IE and generates
annotations easy to understand. Second, the rich semantic information
encoded in the annotations enables various insight management
activities, such as insight browsing and insight retrieval. We present
a formal user study that proved this first benefit. We also illustrate
the second benefit by presenting the novel insight management
activities we developed based on Click2Annotate, namely scented
insight browsing and faceted insight search.
