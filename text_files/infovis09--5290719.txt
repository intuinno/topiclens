A Multi-Threading Architecture to Support Interactive Visual Exploration.

During continuous user interaction, it is hard to provide rich
visual feedback at interactive rates for datasets containing millions of
entries. The contribution of this paper is a generic architecture that
ensures responsiveness of the application even when dealing with large
data and that is applicable to most types of information visualizations.
Our architecture builds on the separation of the main application thread
and the visualization thread, which can be cancelled early due to user
interaction. In combination with a layer mechanism, our architecture
facilitates generating previews incrementally to provide rich visual
feedback quickly. To help avoiding common pitfalls of multi-threading,
we discuss synchronization and communication in detail. We explicitly
denote design choices to control trade-offs. A quantitative evaluation
based on the system VI S P L ORE shows fast visual feedback during
continuous interaction even for millions of entries. We describe
instantiations of our architecture in additional tools.
