The information mural: a technique for displaying and navigating large information spaces.

Visualizations which depict entire information spaces provide
context for navigation and browsing tasks; however, the limited size of
the display screen makes creating effective global views difficult. We
have developed a technique for displaying and navigating large
information spaces. The key concept is the use of an information mural,
a two-dimensional reduced representation of an entire information space
that fits completely within a display window or screen. Information
murals use grayscale shading and color along with anti-aliasing
techniques to create a miniature version of the entire data set. By
incorporating navigational capabilities, information murals become a
tool that can be used as a global view along with more detailed
informational displays. Information murals are utilized in our software
visualization research to help depict the execution of object-oriented
programs, and can also be used in more general information visualization
applications.
