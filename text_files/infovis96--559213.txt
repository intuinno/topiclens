On the semantics of interactive visualizations.

Interactive techniques are powerful tools for manipulating
visualizations to analyze, communicate and acquire information. This is
especially true for large data sets or complex 3D visualizations.
Although many new types of interaction have been introduced recently,
very little work has been done on understanding what their components
are, how they are related and how they can be combined. This paper
begins to address these issues with a framework for classifying
interactive visualizations. Our goal is a framework that will enable us
to develop toolkits for assembling visualization interfaces both
interactively and automatically
