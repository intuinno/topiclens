Comparing Dot and Landscape Spatializations for Visual Memory Differences.

Spatialization displays use a geographic metaphor to arrange
non-spatial data. For example, spatializations are commonly applied to
document collections so that document themes appear as geographic
features such as hills. Many common spatialization interfaces use a 3-D
landscape metaphor to present data. However, it is not clear whether 3-D
spatializations afford improved speed and accuracy for user tasks
compared to similar 2-D spatializations. We describe a user study
comparing users' ability to remember dot displays, 2-D landscapes, and
3-D landscapes for two different data densities (500 vs. 1000 points).
Participants' visual memory was statistically more accurate when viewing
dot displays and 3-D landscapes compared to 2-D landscapes. Furthermore,
accuracy remembering a spatialization was significantly better overall
for denser spatializations. Theseresults are of benefit to visualization
designers who are contemplating the best ways to present data using
spatialization techniques.
