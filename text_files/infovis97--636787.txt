Managing multiple focal levels in Table Lens.

The Table Lens, focus+context visualization for large data
tables, allows users to see 100 times as many data values as a
spreadsheet in the same screen space in a manner that enables an
extremely immediate form of exploratory data analysis. In the original
Table Lens design, data are shown in the context area using graphical
representations in a single pixel row. Scaling up the Table Lens
technique beyond approximately 500 cases (rows) by 40 variables
(columns) requires not showing every value individually and thus raises
challenges for preserving the exploratory and navigational ease and
power of the original design. We describe two design enhancements for
introducing regions of less than a pixel row for each data value and
discuss the issues raised by each.
