Mapping Text with Phrase Nets.

We present a new technique, the phrase net, for generating
visual overviews of unstructured text. A phrase net displays a graph
whose nodes are words and whose edges indicate that two words are linked
by a user-specified relation. These relations may be defined either at
the syntactic or lexical level; different relations often produce very
different perspectives on the same text. Taken together, these
perspectives often provide an illuminating visual overview of the key
concepts and relations in a document or set of documents.
