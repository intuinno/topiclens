Research report: improving browsing in information by the automatic display layout.

It is well known that graphical representations could be very
helpful to browse in graph structured information. But this promising
approach requires the capability of an automatic layout system because
the tedious and time consuming task of a manual layout leads to a
rejection of this approach by the user. In our approach, we split the
task of retrieving information into two phases that are getting the
orientation within the network and reading currently visited
information. We present layout algorithms for both phases which have the
benefit of being flexible and adaptable to individual user requests and
ensure the topological consistency, i.e. the stability of the topology
of the information layout during a sequence of display layouts. The
results show that especially the possibility of an animation of the
layout process can assist the user essentially in maintaining the
orientation in the information network.
