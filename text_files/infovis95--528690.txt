Research report. DataSpace: 3-D visualizations of large databases.

DataSpace is a system for interactive 3-D visualization and
analysis of large databases. DataSpace utilizes the display space by
placing panels of information, possibly generated by different
visualization applications, in a 3-D graph layout, and providing
continuous navigation facilities. Selective rearrangements and
transparency can be used to reduce occlusion or to compare or merge a
set of images (e.g. line graphs or scatter plots) that are aligned and
stacked in depth. A prototype system supporting the basic 3-D graphic
operations (layout, zoom, rotation, translation, transparency) has been
implemented. We provide several illustrative examples of DataSpace
displays taken from the current system. We present the 3-D display
paradigm, describe the query, layout and rendering steps required to
create a display, and discuss some performance issues.
