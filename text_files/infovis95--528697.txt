Case study: 3D displays of Internet traffic.

The explosive growth in world-wide communications, especially
the Internet, has highlighted the need for techniques to visualize
network traffic. The traditional node and link network displays work
well for small datasets but become visually cluttered and
uninterpretable for large datasets. A natural 3D metaphor for displaying
world-wide network data is to position the nodes on a globe and draw
arcs between them coding the traffic. This technique has several
advantages of over the traditional 2D displays, it naturally reduces
line crossing clutter, provides an intuitive model for navigation and
indication of time, and retains the geographic context. Coupling these
strengths with some novel interaction techniques involving the globe
surface translucency and arc heights illustrates the usefulness for this
class of displays.
