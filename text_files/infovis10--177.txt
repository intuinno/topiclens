Mental Models, Visual Reasoning and Interaction in Information Visualization: A Top-down Perspective.

Although previous research has suggested that examining the interplay
between internal and external representations can benefit our
understanding of the role of information visualization (InfoVis) in
human cognitive activities, there has been little work detailing the
nature of internal representations, the relationship between internal
and external representations and how interaction is related to these
representations. In this paper, we identify and illustrate a specific
kind of internal representation, mental models, and outline the
high-level relationships between mental models and external
visualizations. We present a top-down perspective of reasoning as
model construction and simulation, and discuss the role of
visualization in model based reasoning. From this perspective,
interaction can be understood as active modeling for three primary
purposes: external anchoring, information foraging, and cognitive
offloading. Finally we discuss the implications of our approach for
design, evaluation and theory development.
